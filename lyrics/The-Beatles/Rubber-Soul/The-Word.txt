Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me,
Say the word I'm thinking of,
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine,
It's sunshine,
It's the word, love.
In the beginning I misunderstood,
But now I've got it, the word is good.
Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me,
Say the word I'm thinking of,
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine,
It's sunshine,
It's the word, love.
Everywhere I go, I hjear it said.
In the good in the bad books that I have read.
Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me,
Say the word I'm thinking of,
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine,
It's sunshine,
It's the word, love.
Now that I know what I feel must be right,
I want to show everybody the light.
Give the word a chance to say,
That the word is just a way,
It's the word I'm thinking of,
And the only word is love.
It's so fine,
It's sunshine,
It's the word, love.
Say the word love,
Say the word love,
Say the word love.
