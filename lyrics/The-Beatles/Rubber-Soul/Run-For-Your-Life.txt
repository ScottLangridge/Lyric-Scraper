Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man.
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am.
You'd better run for your life if you can,
Little girl,
Hide your head in the sand,
Little girl,
Catch you with another man,
That's the end,
Little girl.
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was borned with a jealous mind.
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line.
You'd better run for your life if you can,
Little girl,
Hide your head in the sand,
Little girl,
Catch you with another man,
That's the end,
Little girl.
Let this be a sermon,
I mean everything I said.
Baby, I'm determined,
And I rather see you dead.
You'd better run for your life if you can,
Little girl,
Hide your head in the sand,
Little girl,
Catch you with another man,
That's the end,
Little girl.
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man.
You'd better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am.
You'd better run for your life if you can,
Little girl,
Hide your head in the sand,
Little girl,
Catch you with another man,
That's the end,
Little girl.
