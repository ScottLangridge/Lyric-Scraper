It's been a long time,
Now I'm
Coming back home.
I've been away now,
Oh how
I've been alone.
Wait
Until I come back to your side,
We'll forget the tears we cried.
But if your heart breaks,
Don't wait,
Turn me away.
And if your heart's strong,
Hold on,
I won't delay.
Wait
Until I come back to your side,
We'll forget the tears we cried.
I feel as though,
You ought to know
That I've been good,
As good as I can be.
And If you do,
I'll trust in you,
And know that you will wait for me.
(Again)
