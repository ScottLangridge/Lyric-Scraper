When I call you up
Your line's engaged.
I have had enough,
So act your age.
We have lost the time,
That was so hard to find,
And I will loose my mind,
If you won't see me.
I don't know why you,
Should want to hide.
But I can't get through,
My hands are tied.
I won't want to stay,
I don't have much to say.
But I can turn away
And you won't see me.
Time after time you refuse to even listen,
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.
Though the days are few,
They're filled with tears,
And since I lost you,
It feels like years.
Yest it seems so long,
Girl since you've been gone,
I just can't go on,
If you won't see me.
