Good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine.
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can blab about.
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's sunny day.
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine.
We take a walk the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground.
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine.
And then we lie beneath a shady tree
I love her and she loving me
She feels good she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine.
Good day sunshine
