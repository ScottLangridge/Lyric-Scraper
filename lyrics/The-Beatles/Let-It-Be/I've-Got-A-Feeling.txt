I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah I've got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah I've got a feeling yeah.

All these years I've been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream,
Everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Everybody had a good year,
Everybody let their hair down,
Everybody pulled their socks up,
Everybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
