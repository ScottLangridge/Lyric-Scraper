(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no... No this I can't believe
(She's gonna tear your heart apart)
No, no, way will she deceive
Don't take chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
(She's an angel sent to me)
(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no... No this I can't believe
(She's gonna tear your heart apart)
No, no, way will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hurts me and says she loves me so...
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
(Listen, can't you see?)
(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no... This I can't believe
(She's gonna tear your heart apart)
No, no way will she deceive
(Don't take chances, leave your romances
So important to you)
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
(She's an angel sent to me....)
(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no... No, this I can't believe
(She's gonna tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, she's an angel sent to me

(She's got the devli in her heart)
No, she's an angel sent to me...
