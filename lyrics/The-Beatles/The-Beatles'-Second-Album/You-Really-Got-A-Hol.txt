I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, ho, ho, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You really got a hold on me
(you really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(you really got a hold on me)
Baby...
I don't want you, but I need you
Don't wanna kiss you, but I need to
Oh, ho, ho you treat me badly
I love you madly
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Baby...
I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me...
Tighter...
Tighter... I want to leave you
Don't wanna to stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Oh, ho, ho I wanna sit now..
I just can't quit now
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Baby
I love you and all I want you to do is just
Hold me (please)
Hold me (squeeze)
Hold me.... Hold me
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
