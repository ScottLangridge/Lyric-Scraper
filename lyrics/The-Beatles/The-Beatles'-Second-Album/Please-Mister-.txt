Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman
Wait, wait mister postman
Mister postman look and see
If you've got a letter in your bag for me,
I been waiting for such a long, long time
Since I heard from that girl of mine.
There must be some word today
From my girlfriend so far away.
Please mister postman look and see
If there's a letter in your bag for for me
I been standing here and waiting mister postman,
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter,
Saying she's returning home to me.
So many days you passed me by,
See the tear standing in my eye.
You didn't stop to make me feel better,
By leaving me a card or a letter
You've got to wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait
Check it and see, one more time for me
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
