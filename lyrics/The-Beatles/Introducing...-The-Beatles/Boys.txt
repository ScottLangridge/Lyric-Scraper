I been told when a boy kisses girl,
Takes a trip around the world,
Hey, hey (3 times)
Yeah, she say you do.
My girl says when I kiss her lips,
Gets a thrill through her fingertips,
Hey, hey (3 times)
Yeah, she say you do.
Well, I talk about boys,
Don't ya know I mean boys,
Well, I talk about boys, now,
Well, I talk about boys, now,
What a bundle of joy
