Last night I said these words to my girl,
I know you never even try girl.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Please please me oh yeah,
Like I please you.
You don't need me to show the way, love.
Why do I always have to say "love,"
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Please please me oh yeah,
Like I please you.
I don't wanna sound complaining but you know there's always rain in my heart.
I do all the pleasig with you, it's so hard to reason with you,
Oh yeah,
Why do you make me blue?
