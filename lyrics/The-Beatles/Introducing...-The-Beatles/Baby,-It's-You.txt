It's not the way you smiled that touched my heart,
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart.
Ooh oh many many, many nights go by,
I sit alone at home and cry over you.
What can I do?
Can't help myself,
'Cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.
You should hear what they say about you,
They say, they say you never never never ever been true.
Ooh oh it doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way.
What can I do? And it's true.
Don't want nobody, nobody,
'Cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you
(Repeat)
Don't leave me all alone...
