Up on cripple creek

When I get off of this mountain

You know where I want to go

Straight down the mississippi river

To the gulf of mexico

To lake charles, louisiana

Little bessie, a girl that I once knew

And she told me just to come on by

If there's anything she could do

{refrain}

Up on cripple creek she sends me

If I spring a leak she mends me

I don't have to speak she defends me

A drunkards dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me

To the race track I did go

She bet on one horse to win

And I bet on another to show

Odds were in my favor

I had him five to one

When that nag to win came around the track

Sure enough he had won

{refrain}

I took up all of my winnings

And I gave my little bessie half

And she tore it up and blew it in my face

Just for a laugh

Now there's one thing in the whole wide world

I sure would like to see

That's when that little love of mine

Dips her doughnut in my tea

{refrain}

Now me and my mate were back at the shack

We had spike jones on the box

She said, I can't take the way he sings

But I love to hear him talk

Now that just gave my heart a fall

To the bottom of my feet

And I swore as I took another pull

My bessie can't be beat

{refrain}

Now, it's hot in california

And up north it's freezing cold

And this living off the road

Is getting pretty old

So I guess I'll call up my big mama

Tell her I'll be rolling in

Bet you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted

To go and see my bessie again

{refrain}
