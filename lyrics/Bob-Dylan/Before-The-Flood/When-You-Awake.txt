Ollie told me I'm a fool. So I
Walked on down the road a mile, Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, And what do you think he said to me?

[Chorus:]
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be
Hangin' on a string from your... When you believe, You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[Chorus:]

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true
