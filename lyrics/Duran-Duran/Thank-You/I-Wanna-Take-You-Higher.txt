Beat is getting stronger,
Feel it getting stronger
Sound is getting longer, too
Music is a thought to me

I want to, I want to
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (light my fire)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher) Whoo!

Beat is nitty gritty, feel it nitty gritty
Sound is in your city, too
Music's been a thought to me

Don't you, don't you, don't, don't
Don't you wanna get higher (take you higher)
Don't you wanna get higher (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (light my fire)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)

Boom shaka-laka-laka!
Boom shaka-laka-laka!
Boom shaka-laka-laka!

Beat is nitty gritty...
I 'm gonna take you high...
Beat is there, I'm with you
Beating there to lose you
Sound is there to help you groove
Music's been a thought to me
Everybody take your places

I'm gonna take you higher (take you higher)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (light my fire)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)
Higher, higher, higher, mmm...
I wanna take you (take you higher)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (light my fire)
I'm gonna take you higher (take you higher)
Don't you wanna get higher (take you higher)
(Take you higher)
I'm gonna take you high (higher)
I'm gonna take you high (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby - baby, baby, baby (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (take you higher)
Higher (take you higher)
(Take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby - baby, baby, baby (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (take you higher)
Higher (take you higher)
(Take you higher)
I'm gonna take you (take you higher)
I'm gonna take you (take you higher)
I'm gonna take, gonna take, gonna take you higher
(light my fire)
I wanna take you, I wanna take you higher
(take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my (take you higher)
