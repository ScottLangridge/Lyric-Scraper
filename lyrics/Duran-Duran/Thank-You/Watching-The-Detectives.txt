Nice girls not one with a defect
Cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs
She is watching the detectives, oh he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot shoot shoot shoot.
They beat him up until the teardrops start.
But he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

Long shot of that jumping sign
Visible shivers running down my spine
Cut the baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says "we never close"
You snatch a tune, you match a cigarrette.
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
I don't know how much more of this I can take
She filing her finger nails
While they're dragging the lake
She is watching the detectives oh he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
Oh they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded
Cos he's got no heart

Now you think you're alone until you realize
You're in it
Now fear is here to stay love is here for a visit.
They call it instant justice when it's past
The legal limit.
Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder
Who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to
The parents
Who are ready to hear the worst about their
Daughter's disappearance.
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Just like watching the detectives. Don't get cute
It's just like watching the detectives.
I get so angry when the tear-drops start
But he can't be wounded cause he's got no heart.
Watching the detectives.
It's just like watching the detectives.
Watching the detectives. Watching the detectives.
