Here comes success
Over my hill
Here comes success
Here comes my car
Here comes my Chinese rug
Here comes success
Yeow!

In the last ditch
I'll think of you
In the last ditch
I will be true
Sweetheart, I'm telling you
Here comes the zoo

Here comes success
Hoo-ray success

Oh oh success
Hoo-rah success
Oh Oh Success
I can't help myself

I just gotta gotta gotta...
I can't stand it!
I need success

Ah, Ah, Ah

Here comes my face
It's plain bizzare
Here comes my face
Out of the crowd
Sweetheart I'm telling you
Here comes the zoo

Oh oh oh

Baby lets blast off
We blast of for success
I'm gonna crash my car
I'm gonna wear a dress
Oh you slay me baby
Were gonna do the twist
Were gonna hop like a frog
Cause we love success

Da, da, da, da, da, (repeat)
