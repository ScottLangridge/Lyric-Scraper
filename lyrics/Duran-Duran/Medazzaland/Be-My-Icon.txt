I follow you, I wait for you
You know there's no escape from me
You're more than wallpaper in my room

I write you letters and bring you gifts
I'm going through all your trash
I love you so much,
I keep your cigarette butts

Now is the time to come out
Come out of the shadows

No need to be scared
You're gonna be so happy
I built you a shrine
Now you can Be My Icon

I'm out on the edge
There's no way back inside
All my friends are gone
They didn't understand me

It makes so much sense
It's no coincidence
Just you and I alone here
And I need you
Oh

How many hours have I stared at my face in the mirror
I get worried sometimes that the image will shatter

No need to be scared
You're gonna be so happy
I built you a shrine
Now you can be my icon
No need to be
Scared
Now you can
Be My Icon

I know this is real
Believe it
We belong together
What ever happens
You're gonna be with me
Forever

Be my icon
You will be my icon
Be my icon
You will be my icon
