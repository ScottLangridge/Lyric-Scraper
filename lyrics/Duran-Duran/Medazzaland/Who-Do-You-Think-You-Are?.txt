I'm giving you the news
Your domination's through
You gave the best you've got
Now I'm out on top

If you're in any doubt
Listen to me
I've got a right to say
If you know what it's all about
Who do you think you are?

Don't want to be your enemy
If I'm not the one you want me to be
And I've got to do things the way that I do

Always trying to control me
Who do you think you are?

Our time on earth is running through
(This is not a question of my pride)
Sometimes I think it's a game to you
(Ever wonder how I feel inside?)
And sometimes I play along
But man I've got a mind!

You've got to live with yourself
For the rest of you life
Do you understand?
Everybody asks themselves the question
Who do you think you are?

Why do you feel ashamed
When you can't explain the things I say
To other people

It's just occurred to me
A possibility
The thought that you might really want to be me?
