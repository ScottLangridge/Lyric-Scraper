Can't say that I was surprised
When you broke the ties
They were hanging by a thread
But now I have realized
It couldn't be the same
Cause everything has changed
And still I held out my hand
Tried to pull you back
But you were buried in the sand

I'm glad that you came along
But here our journey ends
I say goodbye to you
My very dear friend

You were buried in the sand.
Head buried in the sand.
You were buried in the sand.
Head buried in the sand.
You are buried in the sand.
