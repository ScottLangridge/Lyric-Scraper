Do you know how to feel?
Do you know what it means?

Rock-a-bye baby it's time to break
The habit that you fed
Sweet sorrow while the cherished dead
Blow in my mouth, every breath I take
Although I need you I don't want to bleed for you

So long suicide
Going right out of sight, out of mind
Leave me alone and abandoned
Hello, I'm alive
I'm loaded alive, yes I know
In my bones I know what is going to do it for me

I steal the beauty and I taste the hurt
There's always time for pretty flowers
Growing in the dirt
But time is your needle aimed to my heart
And I must be hollow because I can't follow there

So long suicide
Gone right out of sight, out of mind
Leaving me alone and abandoned
Hello, I'm alive
I'm loaded alive and I know
In my bones I know what I'm good for
Hello I'm alive
I'm loaded alive yes I know
In my bones I know what I'm doing

And I'm scared of being ordinary
God I swear to live like anyone
And you know it's hard to swallow
But life goes on

And after all this crash and swell
We are just human
And after all is said and done
We're only human
You're out of sight and out of mind
I'm saying so long suicide

The half dreamed shade of yesterday
In bloom tomorrow
