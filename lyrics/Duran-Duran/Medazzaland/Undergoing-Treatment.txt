We are undergoing treatment
Watching others in the news
Studying our worst reviews
They say we'll get over it
Disappear like dinosaurs
To the sound of small applause
Resign to the mid-price section

If you see me walking in the garden
Don't ever ask me for an autograph
If you ever catch me in the arcade
Don't even stop me for a photograph

We are undergoing treatment
'Til our ethic fits the scene
Laid out in Q Magazine
They crave our conformity
Mediocre to the bone
Terrified testosterone
But why do we still face the music?

If you see me walking in the garden
Don't ever ask me...

Now and then you get the strangest notion
That there's something missing
But it keeps you guessing
Wild ambition can you really blame us?
Can you entertain us?
Can you give a little more?

If you see me walking in the garden
Don't ever ask me for an autograph
If you ever catch me in the arcade
Don't even stop me for a photograph

We are undergoing treatment
But will the doctors ever cure
These delusions of grandeur?
