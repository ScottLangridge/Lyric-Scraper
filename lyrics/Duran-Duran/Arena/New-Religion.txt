I've been now sauntering
Out and down the path sometime
Come on, it takes me nowhere, which I know
Faces everywhere pulling grins and signs in things
Telling me not there, man, it's no go (Don't go there boy)
I need a reason
I can't think without one now
Too much learning got to show
Call it treason
Maybe catch her, don't know how
Too many things, too much to know

I'll bring my timing in, seagulls gather on the wind
Lady screaming, lady leave me out
'Cause sometimes people stare
Sitting down in electric chairs
Steaming crowds they gather and they shout

Don't know why this evil bothers me (Take another chance boy, carry the fight, you can take him if you're fast)
So why is he trying to follow me? (Didn't I say if you're holding on, you'd be laughing at the last?)
How many reasons do they need? (I get along fine with them friends of mine but you have to make a choice)
I might just believe this time (You're singing out of tune but the beat's in time and it's us who makes the noise)

I'm talking for free, I can't stop myself, it's a new religion
I've something to see, I can't help myself, it's a new religion

Ok, my reasoning might be clouded by the sun
But someone sees the departmental lie
You know this peacetime jabbing fist in stabbing knife
Only get one look before you die

Gotta take pay from the saints 'n sinners
In regulation hats 'n scarves 'n things
Walking in formation down the lane,
They carry their cross, make a church bell ring (Bring it out now)
Army majors pull a mean cool truth
There lying in a swimming pool
Searching for the undeniable truth that
A man is just a fool
