Here comes the morning light you can't face
Lie on your bed staring into space
Watch the time slip gently by
Don't ask why

So many friends but nobody calls
Can't be alone when the darkness falls
Got to make it to the party
Socialise, break the ice

Oh, Lady Xanax where were you last night?
All the cracks in your make-up are starting to show
Don't think that you realise how far away you go now
Look into the future and don't be afraid... Afraid
Of what is on your mind

There, in the emptiness deep inside
You are the one that's been left behind
So you paint with your mascara
Social eyes, don't look twice

Oh, Lady Xanax where were you last night?
All the cracks in your make-up are starting to show
Don't think that you realise how far away you go now
Look into the future and don't be afraid... Afraid

Lady Xanax, you're out tonight
Lady Xanax, you're, oh, so tired
Lady Xanax, sleep well tonight

Lady Xanax  (Lady Xanax)
