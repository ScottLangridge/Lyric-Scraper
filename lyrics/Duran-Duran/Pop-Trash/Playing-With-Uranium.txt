In for an evening
Of light entertainment
And who would believe you
Could worry the neighbours?
Come on over to my place
Playing with uranium
If it blows up in your face
See you on the other side
Come on over to my place

Playing with uranium
Reinvent the human race
You just got the invitation

We go undiscovered
'Cause people are careless
One way or another
They'll never forget us

Come on over to my place
Playing with uranium
And if it blows up in your face
See you on the other side
Come on over to my place
Never be the same again
Reinvent the human race
You just got the invitation

Playing with uranium
Playing with uranium
Never be the same again
Because we're playing with uranium
