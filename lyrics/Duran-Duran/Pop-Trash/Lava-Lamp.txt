In the half light of the evening
I can almost see you glow
Can tell by the way you're moving
Time may be right to let you know
You got many coloured halo,
The body of Venus, a babe rainbow
And if I come any closer I might fall into your silhouette
But the shape of things to come is constantly changing
So let it, so let it, so let it flow

La la la la lava lamp
La la la la lava lamp

Indigo, violet and blue
Can we meet where the edges blur?
Because I am coming at you
Like a bug eye heading for the burn
Truth is I can't stay away
No, I wanna let you light my volcano
And maybe it's just in my imagination
But you never know
Because the shape of things to come is constantly changing
So let it, so let it, so let it flow

La la la la lava lamp (I'd love to turn you on)
La la la la lava lamp (I'd love to turn you on)

La la la la lava lamp (I'd love to turn you on)
La la la la lava lamp (I'd love to turn you on)

So let it, so let it, so let it...
La la la la lava lamp (I'd love to turn you on)
La la la la lava lamp (I'd love to turn you on)
