Now while the beat is slow
Here in your arms I sway
Now that the light is low
Something I want to say
I guess you've known it for a while
But I mean trouble
I only want to see you smile
And I burst this bubble
The hardest thing is to let go

When love is real...
Like a flower loves a bee
But I know you're meant to give yourself to someone else
Not me

And I could carry on with you
Does that sound crazy?
I think you feel the same way too
And you can't face it
The hardest thing is to let go

But it's not defeat
When you set somebody free
And I know you're meant to be yourself with someone else
Not me

Can you let go?
'Cause that's love that's real
Like a flower loves a bee
And you know you're meant to give yourself to someone else
Not me

Somebody else not me
Meant for somebody else not me
Somebody else not me
