At the end of the rainbow
Found each other there
Strange, we never thought the colours would fade
Be easy to walk
But it's much harder to stay
Why, oh why, are we reckless today?

You and I
Got to hold on together
Because in this life
Maybe the sun doesn't shine forever

Could say that I'm sorry
But there's no one to blame
Anger seems to dissolve into tears
Been so many good times
Not only despair
Somehow we'll find the love we can share

You and I
Got to hold on together
Because in this life
Maybe the sun doesn't shine forever

You and I
Make this life for each other
Because I believe
We've got enough for when the sun doesn't shine
You and I
Got to hold on together
Because in this life
Maybe the sun doesn't shine forever
