Saw a close up of your pretty face
Overnight sensation
Smiling for cameras
From all around the world
If I rewind back to yesterday
And stop the tape there
No one knew who you were
But now they're at your door

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for just a few minutes
Part of a celluloid dream

Watching slow-mo going frame-by-frame
Might have blurred my vision
Your life went flashing by
Where did it all go wrong?

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for fifteen minutes
Part of a celluloid dream

I'll wait in the wings for you
I'll read your lines to you
But now the script is final you know, it's time to go
So we'll have to say goodbye

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for those fifteen minutes
Part of a celluloid dream
We star in every scene
And it's never quite what it seems

(Never)

I'm living in a pop trash movie
I know we'll make it with that pop trash - yeah
We'll all be famous for those fifteen minutes
Part of a celluloid dream, yeah

8. Mars meets venus

Thirtysomething graduate - green eyes -
Perfect Christian lady - candlelit dinner -
Slim female figure - sense of humour -
Extrovert where are you?...
Where are you?... Where are you?

Let's start as friends -
Seeking soul mate - long-term relationship -
Choose life - soul sister -
Hippie chick for soul brother bluesman -
Genuine American frog seeks princess...

Someone is perfect for you (when Mars meets Venus)
Do you wanna bet your life
You're gonna be perfect for them too?
New-age man - shake me up, wild girl - gay guy -
Romantic German - Indian - long-term relationship -
Beauty with brains - missing something -
Say... Are you the one?... Are you the one?

Someone is perfect for you (when Mars meets Venus)
Do you wanna bet your life
You're gonna be perfect for them too? (Mars meets Venus)...

Here's looking at you.
