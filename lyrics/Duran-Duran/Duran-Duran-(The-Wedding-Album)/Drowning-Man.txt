He's sinking faster than a drowning man
He'll grab a hold of anyone he can
Gun in his poket and a heart of ham
Uncle Sam

He's dying faster than a rabid dog
Infect us all now he's losing blood
Nose for trouble and a soul of rock
Smokey's man

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
Your going down

NA NANA NA NANA NANA NA NA

There's not much flesh
Just skin and bone
Cheeks sunk deep
Eyes popping wide

Don't put out a hand to help him
This drowning man will bite it right off

RIGHT OFF
RIGHT OFF
RIGHT OFF

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
Your going down

NA NANA NA NANA NANA NA NA

MID

He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV Screen

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
Your going down

NA NANA NA NANA NANA NA NA
