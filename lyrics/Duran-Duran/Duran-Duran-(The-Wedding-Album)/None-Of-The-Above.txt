There was a time I was so afraid
Of everything people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows

There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan I thought could not fail
But no power under the sun could pull it together

I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question

I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use No-one
Money, power, Holy roads.
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

If there's a time that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there
To kick at the answer

I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question

I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use No-one
Money, power, Holy roads.
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use No-one
Money, power, Holy roads.
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

MIDDLE

I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use No-one
Money, power, Holy roads.
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use No-one
Money, power, Holy roads.
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

None of the above
I stand by none of the above
