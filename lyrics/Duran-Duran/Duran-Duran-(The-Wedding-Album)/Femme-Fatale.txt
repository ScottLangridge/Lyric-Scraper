Here she comes you better watch your step.
She's going to break your heart in two
Its true it's not hard to realize
Just look into her false coloured eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down,
What a clown

'Coz everybody knows... She's a femme fatale
Things she does to please, sees just a little tease
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks

You're written in her book,
You're number 37 take a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy she's from the street
Before you start your're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
Yes it's true

'Coz everybody knows... She's a femme fatale
Things she does to please, sees just a little tease
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks
She will try to put you doen, the hardest girl around

'Coz everybody knows... She's a femme fatale
Things she does to please, sees just a little tease
She's a femme fatale.
