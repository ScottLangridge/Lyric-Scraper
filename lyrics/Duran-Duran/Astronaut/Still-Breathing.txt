Home, it's not brick or stone
Or comfort in the firelight,
Not in that sense anyway.
Dreams, if only I had known
But these things always seem
So much clearer at a distance.

I'm walking out of this town
I'm never going back there,
I'm never going back there.
I'd burn the place to the ground.
I'm never going back there,
I'm never going back there again.

Words only could break that ring
You know the words still sting
So much harder than the blows ever did.
Heart, though it's hot and violent
My head is cool and quiet
As the ashes that fall from the sky

I'm walking out of this town
I'm never going back there,
I'm never going back there.
I burn the place to the ground.
I'm never going back there,
I'm never going back there again.

Now, I know this shattered feeling,
Trampled but still breathing.

I'm just waiting for a good day
I'm walking out of this town
I'm never going back there,
I'm never going back there.
I've burn the place to the ground.
I'm never going back there,
I'm never going back there again.
Never going back there again,
I'm never going back there again
