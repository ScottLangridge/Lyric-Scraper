The random aspects of our lives
Come together once in a while
So blinding and decidedly
Naivete falls from our eyes
And we'll not regain
As we watch the tower falling down

Maybe things can change
Only if you want
Maybe things can change
Only if you want

You know, you know there's no avoiding
The lesson to be learned
The lesson to be learned
The point of no return
You say "What if?"
But can you live it?
It's all that we deserve
It's all that we deserve
The point of no return

Don't blame yourself
Don't blame me
But we're the ones
Who can feed the ground
So this poison tree, don't let it grow again
And from this glass and broken earth
There is a way that can be built
A better life for everyone

Maybe things can change
Only if you want
Maybe things can change
Only if you want
