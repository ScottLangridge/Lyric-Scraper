Verse 1

Makes my hair stand up on end,
Something alien happening,
Sychronize but don't comprehend,
Cos where i stop that's where you begin!

Another moment i commit,
A pleasure rise im gonna take the hit,
And i'm addicted to the state your in,
Cos your getting me out of it!

Chorus

Wasted, there's nothing gonna face this,
And were gonna go to space gift,
Cos i'm leaving with An Astronaut!

Music

Da Da Da Da!

Verse 2

Proven now to X-ray specs,
Something tells me your the alien sex,
I can't imagine now what comes next,
When this Astronaut connects!

Coming on when i touch your skin,
A kinda strange that you will miss,
I hear your vanity pull me in,
Now your getting me out of it!

Chorus

Wasted, there's nothing gonna face this,
And were gonna go to space gift,
Cos i'm leaving with An Astronaut!
Wasted, there's nothing gonna face this,
And were gonna go to space gift,
Cos i'm leaving with An Astronaut!

Verse 3

Where feet for Quantom Leap,
Because space is hot and deep,
And we follow giant footprints,
As we fall in, falling like the twins,
Through satins holy wings,
And if they can hold us where it's gonna end up,
Everybody does!

Music

An Astronaut

Chorus

Wasted, there's nothing gonna face this,
And were gonna go to space gift,
Cos i'm leaving with An Astronaut!
Wasted, there's nothing gonna face this,
And were gonna go to space gift,
Cos i'm leaving with An Astronaut!
