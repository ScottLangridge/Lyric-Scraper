Child, don't you worry
It's enough you're growing up in such a hurry
Brings you down the news they sell you
To put in your mind that all mankind is a failure

But nobody knows what's gonna happen tomorrow
We try not to show how frightened we are
If you let me I'll protect you however I can

You've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end

Fighting, because we're so close
There are times we punish those who we need the most
No, we can't wait for a saviour
Only got ourselves to blame for this behaviour

And nobody knows what's gonna happen tomorrow
We try not to show how frightened we are
Would seem lonely, if you were the only star in the night

You've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end

You've got to believe
It'll be alright again

Time is a river
A silent icy river
Pulls us all
Running deep
Deep and fast enough to get lost down in the flow
Thrashing around me
Tiny lives mean everything

And nobody knows what's gonna happen tomorrow
So don't let go, now we've come this far
Hold my hand please
Understand me
You're never alone

We've got to believe
It'll be alright in the end

Nobody knows

You've got to believe
It'll be alright my friend

So don't let go

Unless we believe
It'll be alright again

Nobody knows
