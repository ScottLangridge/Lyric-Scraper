An hour since the sundown
The ghosts are creepin in
Are gathering around me
Like starlings in the wind

Dark shapes gather round

Voices like my brother's
Are whispering to me
But I don't know these others
Who want to set me free

Come home you're out of time

But the life cannot let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

The door is standing open
But I'm too tired to be afraid
My whole life's in this moment
I've been fighting all the way

Just need a little more time

'cause the life just can't let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

Nah nah nah nah nah

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

Chains... Chains... Chains...
