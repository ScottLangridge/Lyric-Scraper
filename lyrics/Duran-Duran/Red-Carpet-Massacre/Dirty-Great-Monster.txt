There's a dirty great monster
In this house
We pretend it's not there
And there's no escape
From It's grip
But nobody seems to care
Do you ever wonder
About the days
When we were straight
But daddy got the hunger
So much to hide
We learn to lie

So watch yourself
In the hall
Where you're not supposed to know
Cuz we're all afraid of each other
We're the victim's in this show

Well Do you ever wonder
About the days
When we were straight
When daddy got the hunger
Too much to hide
We learn to lie
Silently out numbered
We made mistakes
When we were straight
Now we're all going under

Oh oh

So with a sigh we say good bye
