Now an unexpected peace comes to the day
As the howling dimmed the fighting dies away
When the hanging dust is clearing from the air
You can just make out a lonely figure there

He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back

He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back

He's sorry for the wrong he has done
And he cries out for the anger for so long
All the cuts and bruises suffered
In whose name
Oh but now is not the time to face his shame

He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back

The last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back

He's the last man standing
Last man standing
He's the last man standing
