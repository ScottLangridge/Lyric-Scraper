She's gentle to the touch
She's everything head first
So happy to be causing trouble

Sometimes
The pressure gets too much
And you think she's going to burst
And shatter like a Christmas bubble

I'll be there when the world is
Coming down upon her
When she's scared, I'll be there
Fighting in her corner

She cries when she's alone
For all life's little knocks
Everything is supposed to make us tougher
Thinking is doesn't really show
But I know how she hurts
And I can't bare to see her suffer

I'll be there when the world is
Coming down upon her
When she's scared, I'll be there
Fighting in her corner
I'll be there when the world
Is closing to surround her
In the air as she falls with my arms around her

Holding on I'm looking out for
Her thin skin
Because she's everything
And I don't think she knows

She's such a gentle touch
She's too much a gentle touch
She likes to catch the sun
Plays with it like a ball
And never mind whatever keeps it burning
Someday, she might just be the one
Whose going to save us all
If this apocalipse is coming

I'll be there when the world is
Coming down upon her
When she's scared, I'll be there
Fighting in her corner
I'll be there when the world
Is closing to surround her
In the air as she falls with my arms around her

Holding on I'm looking out for
Her thin skin
Because she's everything
And I don't think she knows

I don't think she knows
I don't think she knows
(she's too much)
I don't think she knows
(she's too much) a gentle touch
