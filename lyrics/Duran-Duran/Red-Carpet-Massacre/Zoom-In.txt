Zooming in
Stood on the line
You understand
I've been waiting forever
Come rain come shine
In the wind in the snow
In the filty weather
You've got it all worked out
Ya but it knocks you out
But I'm zooming in

Now she arrives
In a flaming crash
Like a falling star
Heading straight for the dive
Gonna make some cash
With the avatar

You got it all worked out
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Ya but it knocks you out
I'm zooming in on you on you

Don't look back you're a heart attack [x4]
You've got it all worked out
Ya but it knocks you out

We're not alone
In the 2nd life
There are millions like us
Right here
In the stones
In the air too bright
All the new insiders

You've got it all worked out
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Ya but it knocks you out
I'm zooming in on you on you

Na na na na na na
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Na na na na na na
I'm zooming in and out on you
