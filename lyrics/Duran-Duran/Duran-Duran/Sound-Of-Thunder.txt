I've been in this grass here for the last 10 hours
My clothes are dirty but my mouth isn't dry
How does it happen?  Does it fly through the air?
Oh I gave up asking days away
I gave up asking
Days away

And now I'm lying here waiting for the Sound of Thunder
Waiting for the Sound of Thunder
Here I am, I'm a dotted line
Cut the corner, stick me to your door
I'm the man who stepped off the path
And I just lie here
It's what I was made for

And now my eyes are closing, but I still feel the land
Leaning out for the touch of my hand
The world spins so fast that I might fly off
The world spins so fast that I might fly off
The world spins so fast, I might fly off

Waiting for the Sound of Thunder
I'm waiting for the Sound of Thunder
I'm waiting for the Sound of Thunder
I'm waiting for the Sound of Thunder
I'm waiting for the Sound of Thunder
I'm waiting for the Sound of Thunder
I'm waiting for the Sound of Thunder
Fade out
