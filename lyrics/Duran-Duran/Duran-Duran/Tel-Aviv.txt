The afternoon, it's one maybe two
Sipping away my last gold star, not so much to do
Dream away the sunny day until it's time to leave
I'll just watch you pass on by
When I'm on my own in tel aviv

With the blocks to one side
The beach on the other
And the trees and the leaves
On my own in tel aviv
And the trees and the leaves
On my own in tel aviv
