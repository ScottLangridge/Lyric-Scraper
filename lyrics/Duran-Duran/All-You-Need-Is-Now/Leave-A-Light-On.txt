So come the evening
I'm out on the dunes
Looking for a token, something to prove
All I remember, is more than a flame
In my fantasy fire

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

Chorus
I know, I swear
If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

In comes the morning
I'm stirred in my track
Looking at the reasons for me to head back
So unexpected
The kindness you've shown
That I will not forget it

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

Chorus
I know, I swear
If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

You breathe the will into the weak
And coax the caged bird to fly free. You ease the lost cause out of me
With your sweet hand to bring me home

I'm not alone

Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh

Chorus
I know, I swear
If you leave a light on, if you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

Repeat chorus
