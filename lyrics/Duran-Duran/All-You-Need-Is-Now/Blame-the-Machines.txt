I'm driving up the autobahn
Losing my way as the night gets long
These headlights shining in my face
Scream out the danger of this place

And now there's no way home
This love affair is ended
I should have known
When I bought into the dream
So like your sonic soul 
To leave me lost and stranded
I blame myself
And I blame the machines

I'm flying blind
I'm speeding through
I hate to think
I've been fooled by you
an interactive nightmare show
Which never ends
It just goes on and on and on

And now there's no way home
This love affair is ended
I should have known
When I bought into the dream
So like your sonic soul 
To leave me lost and stranded
I blame myself
And I blame the machines

And now
turn left
I have control
You are not 
Required
To think
At all
Everything we hear (goes on and on)
Everything we see 
Everything we love (goes on and on)
Everything we feel 
Everything we want (goes on and on and on and on)
Everything we do 
Everywhere we go 
Everything we know

And now there's no way home
This love affair is ended
I should have known
When I bought into the dream
So like your sonic soul 
To leave me lost and stranded
I blame myself
And I blame the machines
I blame the machines
Blame the machines
I blame the machines
Blame the machines
I blame the machines
Blame the machines
