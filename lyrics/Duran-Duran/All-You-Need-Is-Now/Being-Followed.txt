To the voyeur
Sitting in a darkened room
Do you thrill
When the green light starts pulsing
Paranoia
The only valid point of view
If you know
What I'm saying

I'm not alone
Being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone
But I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know

Something shifting
Between the sirens and the glow
Of red lights
And the blue slowly turning
The fog is lifting
A silhouette begins to show
And the moment is stolen

I'm not alone
Being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone
But I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know

In this chamber
Lit by scandal
You're the bullet
In the barrel
You're the last thing
As I'm falling
Bloody roaring
Still I'm calling out
I'm calling out

I'm not alone
Being followed
Never alone
I'm being followed
I'm not alone
Being followed
Never alone
I'm being followed
La la la la la la la.
