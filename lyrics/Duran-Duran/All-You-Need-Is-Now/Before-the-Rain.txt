A stormy summer
Is rolling closer
Lighting up this holy smoker 
And if this drinking
Could ease the thinking
I'd toast to my home truth
With this glass
Oh, rise, you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words 
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain... 

Little pin pricks
And how my ears bleed
On the bomb ticks that is my heartbeat
In every life flash
In every car crash
I hear the silence waiting to fall
Oh, rise, you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words 
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain... 

For all I carry
Are murdered secrets 
The price of my blue star-eyed weakness
And so we travel
And we unravel
Towards the place where all loose ends go
Oh, rise, you promises is broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words 
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain...
