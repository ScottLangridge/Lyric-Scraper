At the door blowing a kiss she's
Careful not to wake her sister
Knowing that she will be missed
It feels a little bad girl
On the corner engine running
Taxi driver sees her coming
Chilly in the morning sun
She seems a little sad

Say goodbye
She's not afraid of leaving
No one by her side
And nothing to hang on
Wave goodbye (goodbye, goodbye)
To everything familiar
There's a world to find
Runway, runaway
Just run away

Looking back
She sees the pattern
Hidden princess in the attic
Realize this picture that
Is more than she will hope for
Happy when her
Heart is jumping
Desperately seeking something
Trying to be strong enough
To choose another road

Say goodbye
She's not afraid of leaving
No one by her side
And nothing to hang on
Wave goodbye (goodbye, goodbye)
To everything familiar
There's a world to find
Runway, runaway
Just run away
Runway, runaway
Just run away
Runway, runaway
Run away
Runway, runaway
Just run away
