Hold back the rain
Yes we're miles away from nowhere and the wind doesn't have a name
So call it what you want to call it still blows down the lane
People tell me I haven't changed at all but I don't feel the same
And I've bet you've had that feeling too you can't laugh all the time

And if the fires burn out there's only fire to blame (hold back the rain)
No time for worry cause we're on the roam again (hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane (hold back the rain)
Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain

So what if the words ain't rhyming did you thing that it's just a game
I probably didn't even say that right and I really don't give a damn
Okay go off and wander I'm guilty just the same
Sometimes you're needed badly so please come back again
And if the fires burn out there's only fire to blame (hold back the rain)
No time for worry cause we're on the roam again (hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane (hold back the rain)
Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain

And if the stars burn out there's only fire to blame (hold back the rain)
No time for worry cause we're on the roam again (hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane (hold back the rain)
Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain
Hold back the rain, hold back the rain. Hold back the rain
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rain
(Hold back the rain), hold back the rain (hold back the rain)
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rain
