I saw you at the air-race yesterday
April showers get out of my way
Fear of flying? No not me
I'm never bothered what you say
Someone's kid just lives for today
It ain't your problem anyway

'Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, 'cause I've got my own way
'Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, 'cause I've got my own way

Number one public figure, what a pain
Just puts another rattle in your brain
Take another green but it's not the same
So now you're on the sand-lane everyday
Dancing with the bulls in any old way
Running like a fox to keep up with me

'Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, 'cause I've got my own way
'Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, 'cause I've got my own way

I'm on 45, between 6th and Broadway

7UP, between 6th and Broadway

'Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, 'cause I've got my own way
'Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, 'cause I've got my own way

Yeah, defence, check 20
Yeah bitch, listen, yeah, this is how I like it
Teenage floats on top
Yeah, settle down
Yes, go on, right over it we go
Shot down when we take the bullets and roll back down
He ain't got promises 'round that sound

Hey you, where'd ya got it?
I did not get it man
You're in it, lets do, let's do it, I'm ready to go
