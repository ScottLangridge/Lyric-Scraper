I,....... So Misled.

In the summer of a London life,
"Gold," she said, was a month before I
Realised sold instead.
Babe, it's such an awful choice.
Don't break my back.
Take it easy, now you whipping boy.
Don't wanna feel the crack.

Trust my head to say lose it;
Now my body's got to use it.

Chorus
I should not be So Misled.
I should not be So Misled.

Saw an advert in a magazine;
Safe it said, with the satisfaction
Guaranteed to cool your head.

I can't see the solution
To this state of confusion.

Chorus

Instrumental ad lib.

Chorus (Repeated for fade)
