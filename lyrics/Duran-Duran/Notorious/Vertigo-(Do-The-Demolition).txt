Hey guys, turn it up to get sleazy.
Twist it in a vice
Nobody said it was easy.
Just use your naked eyes, oh.
How to see and how to hide it.
How to save it. Well, maybe. Maybe. Maybe.
You can take it and eat it, and chew your life supply.

Where's the real life in your illusion?
On the dark side your power's in confusion.
Do the dance. Do the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen.

Don't you feel edgy?
Bite your lips and bleed.
Conversation is empty;
Abandoned in the freeze.
Freedom is your condemnation.
Free to say well, maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.
You can take it or leave it.
Just need a little hit tonight.

Where's the real life in your illusion?
On the dark of power in confusion.
Do the dance. Do the demolition.
Don't lose the chance to hear 'cause you don't listen.

Maybe. Maybe. Maybe you can try to believe it.
Just need a little help tonight.

Where's the real life in your illusion?
On the dark side of power in confusion.
Do the dance. Do the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen.

Where's the real life in your illusion?
On the dark side of power in confusion.
Do the dance. Do the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen.

Repeat for fade:
Hear it when you listen.
You don't hear when you don't listen.
