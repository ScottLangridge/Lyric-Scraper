Yeah, this time.
Shall we walk?
Shall we run through my head, you understand?
Does the body you conceal
Need the touch of someone's hand?
Ashes; violations.
Who would they burn for?
In your isolation what can't you see?

I wonder if the light's down.
I wonder if they're listening.

Chorus
Hold me. Lay your shame away.
Show me where your lovers stay.
Hold me. Lay your ghost away.
Show me for yourself.

You are lost and alone,
But a prisoner of your pride.
When the passions you ignore
You can never hide.
One of these days you're gonna find out,
'cause one of these days you're gonna try.
And what did I say
To make you wind up
With this spear of guilt inside.

I wonder if the light's down.
I wonder if they're listening.

Chorus

Na na na na na na na. Hold Me.
Na na na na na na. Show me.
No na na na na na na na na na.

Chorus
