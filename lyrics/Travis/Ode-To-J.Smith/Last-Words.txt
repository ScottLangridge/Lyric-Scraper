Try to shine a light into the dark
Corners of the mind and of the heart
Find out what you're carrying round
Things you can't remember having found

Holding on, the best you can
Finding out in the nick of time

But the last words are hanging on my phone
Oh, the last words even when you're standing on your own
Oh, the last words are lying on my floor
Oh, the last words

Try to find a place you can begin
Begin to fill the space you're living in
Rip it up and start it all again
Turning all your enemies to friends

Oh, holding on the best you can
Finding out in the nick of time

But the last words are hanging on my phone
Oh, the last words even when you're standing on your own
Oh, the last words are lying on my floor
Oh, the last words

Oh, the last words are hanging on my phone
Oh, the last words even when you're standing on your own
Oh, the last words are lying on your floor
Oh, the last words, I know, I know, you know

Oh, the last words are hanging on my phone
Oh, the last words even when you're standing on your own
Oh, the last words are lying on your floor
Oh, the last words
