Verse 1:
Another day, I feel the weight of the atmospheres pressure
And I cant escape
I try to run, I try to find my feet,
My soul is sticking to the street
I get a move, I got to get myself to clean my shoes
And take the cynic route
I was afar, Im following the star
Home isnt where you are

Chorus:
And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until were gone, were moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on

Verse 2:
I feel alive, I am aware of the colors in the sky
And where the birds dont fly
And if the night is coming pretty soon
Im walking through the dark with you
Ive got to play
Ive got to listen to my toy today
On the motorway
And I could feel, the ground beneath my wheels,
Putting me back in my place

Chorus:
And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until were gone, were moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on,

Verse 3:
Another day, another place where I can find my way
Take the avenue way
And I know exactly where to go
Home isnt where you stay

Chorus:
And everything is falling into place
And then we move again
So take the curve and move along
Until were gone, were moving on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on

Outro:
I feel alive, I am aware of the colors in the sky
And where the birds dont fly
And if the night is coming &#7767; retty soon
Im walking through the dark with you
