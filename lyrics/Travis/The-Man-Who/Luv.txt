What's so wrong
Why the face so long
Is it over?
And where you going that
You no longer belong here?
And distance tells you that
Distance must come between love
Where have you been, love?
When the mistake we made
Was in never having planned to fall in love, love
Singing this song
Singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so
In letting you go
It only serves to show me
That I'm still in love with you
Singing this song
Singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so
It only serves to show me
That I'm still in love with you
So what's so wrong
Why the face?
So long!
Are you changing?
And where you been to that
You no longer remember?
And distance tells you that
Distance must come between love
Where have you been, love?
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, love
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, love
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, love
Luv
