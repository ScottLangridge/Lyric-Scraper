Today was the day
For dancing and for singing
The birds in the trees
And all the bells are ringing
The sun in the sky
Is bright as bright as second side/sight
Is bright oh God I hope I'm alright
Cause I'm gonna cry
Hold on, hold on
Slow down, slow down
You're out of touch
Out of touch
Cause there is no design for life
There's no devils haircut in my mind
There is not a wonderwall
To climb or step around
But there is a slideshow and it's so slow
Flashing through my mind
Today was the day
But only for the first time
Cause there is no design for life
There's no devils haircut in your mind
There is not a wonderwall
To climb or step around
But there is a slideshow and it's so slow
Flashing through your mind
Today is the day
But only for the first time
I hope it's not the last time
