Memories fill your harbour
History to be made
Jealousy in the cupboard
You with me to the grave
Mid-life krysis
You invited everyone
You can't win
You can't wake from this nightmare
Every day is like a movie
Third world war on the rise
Don't take it in the city
Making love to get high
Mid-life krysis
You invited everyone
You can't win
You can't wake from this nightmare
I waste my time I waste my
Don't waste my time don't waste my
I waste my time I waste my
Don't waste my time don't waste my
Energy
Say you're in love with me
Save yourself
Maybe then
You'll have some children
Maybe you'll have none
Mid-life krysis
You invited everyone
You can't win
You can't wake from this nightmare
And you invited everyone
You can't win
You can't wake from this nightmare
