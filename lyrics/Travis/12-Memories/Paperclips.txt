Paperclips, melody
Hold together all these memories
Memories
Memories
I don't wanna think at all

I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna be like you anymore, anymore, anymore

Take a trip, down memory lane
You will never wanna go again
Take your leave
Take your leave
I don't wanna sing at all

I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't want to live like you anymore, anymore, anymore

Ever talk, decide out
We get by, we'll get by
And I won't take this
No more sadness, no, no

Paperclips, memories
Hold together all these melodies
Melodies
Melodies
I don't want to sing at all

I don't want to be like you anymore
I don't want to see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't want to live like you anymore, anymore, anymore
