You were on my mind
Inside the cinema
You looked so beautiful
I almost had to go
And when I got outside
I thought of you again
I think you should be framed
In some Fine Art gallery
I know you'd disagree with me
But I love you anyways
And should I climb high my
Dreary city walls
They make me feel so small
Oh let me fade away
This city's so cold & old
Forever rain or snow
I'd really love to come and go
Oh won't you go stay with me
I know you'd disagree with me
I just know you'd disagree
But I love you anyways
You were on my mind
Inside the cinema
You looked so beautiful
I almost dried an eye
And when I got outside
I caught the 44
It dropped me outside my front door
Forgot what I'd been living for
