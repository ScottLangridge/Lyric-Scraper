La la lala la laa la la lala la X4

I met a girl in L. A.
The million dollar kind
She was all for all or nothing
She was open all the time
But when I called her number
Her mother's on the line sayin'
You've no business
As God's my witness
With a child as young as mine

[Chorus:]
So make sure that she's old enough
Before you blow your mind
She may look like she knows enough
But look in her eye
And if so
Let her go
You'll let her down in style

La la lala la laa la la lala la X4

I met a girl in Paris
She talked like Vera Lynn
And her eyes were full of dew drop
The moment I walked in
She was awfully nice
The kind that likes to win
But if I'd been wiser
A whole lot wiser
Then I might have thought again

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

La la lala la laa la la lala la X4
