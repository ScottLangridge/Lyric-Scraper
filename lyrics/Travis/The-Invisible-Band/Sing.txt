Baby, you've been going so crazy
Lately nothing seems to be going right
Solo, why do you have to get so low
You're so...
You've been waiting in the sun too long

[Chorus:]
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Colder, crying over your shoulder
Hold her, tell her everything's gonna be fine
Surely, you've been going too early
Hurry cause no-one's gonna be stopped
Na na na na

[Chorus:]
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing

Uhhh... Ahh ahh.. Uhhh

Baby, there's something going on today
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing(fades out)

[Chorus:]
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Ohh baby sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
