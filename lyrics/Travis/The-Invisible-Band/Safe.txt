Take all the goods from all the bads
And tell the people that you've gone away
Now lift your head up to the sky
Now you can tell apart the black from the white
We waste the time they treasure dear
My only thought is that they could be right
Oh look there goes another year
About as distant as a satellite
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe.
So safe.
The world's a small child in the dark
And my mind's the same place as it's always been
The monsters seem to fade so fast
Upon the waking of another dream
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe.
And I feel safe. I feel so brave.
I'm not afraid of anything they've got to say
And you're ok because you're tucked away
Don't go astray, you've got to be just who you are
Who you are
When I was young things didn't last
My only care stemmed to the price of sweets
Now I am older I can laugh
A dolly mixed up man with rotten teeth
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe
And I feel safe, so safe.
So safe.
