Dear Diary
What is wrong with me?
'Cos I'm fine between the lines
Be not afraid
Help is ons it's way
A sentence suspended in air
Way over there
Dear Diary
What else could it be?
As nightshade descends like a veil
Under the sail of my heart
Be still, don't stop until the end
Dear Dairy
What is wrong with me?
'Cos I'm fine between the lines
