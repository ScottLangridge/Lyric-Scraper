In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it...

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it

If you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?

Singing please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me

Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out...  To me, me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah
