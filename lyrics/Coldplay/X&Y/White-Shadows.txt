When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows blink and miss them
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missin'
Things you never understand
Little white shadows - sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Ohhhh...

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you know when you've see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?
We're part of the human race
All of the stars in the outer space
Are part of a system, a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Ohhhh...

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimmin' on a sea of faces
Tired of the human races
Oh an answer now is what I need
See it in the new sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me
