You're in control
Is there anywhere you wanna go
You're in control
Is there anything you wanna know
The future's for discovering
The space in which we travel in

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Decifering the codes you knew
I need compas, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back
Whoa whoa whoah

The first line in the first page
To the end of the last place
You were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Ohhh

You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
Oh, you just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one
And have you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult had fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one
