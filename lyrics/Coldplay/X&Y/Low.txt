You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong you might

The sky could fall could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more mean more to me
Than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up

All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up, as us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted bright
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

And all you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up

All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down on this Earth

Don't you want to see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silverspoon

Don't you want to see it come down
Careful throwing your arms around
And saying you're a moment too soon

Cause I feel low
Cause I feel low
Oh, yeah I feel low
Oh yeah
Oh

Oh
Cause I feel low
Cause I feel low
Oh
And I feel low
Oh love
Oh
