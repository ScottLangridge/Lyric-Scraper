You got wonder on what you knew
And wonder on what you do
So be careful who you're talking to

You got one eye on what you knew
And one eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

So be careful... ! 
So be careful when you're walking in the view! 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you! 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you

You got one eye on what you knew
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing is true

... Don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just gotta turn to... 

I hear those crocodiles ticking 'round the world
I hear those crocodiles ticking (you go) ticking 'round the world
 
Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you! 

Ooh-oooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh-oooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and... 
 
Ooh-oooh-oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you! 
Got one eye on the road and one on you
