The birds they sang
The break of day
Start again I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue
Dreamed of light til it's true
Then take it back the pause shall through
My arms turn wings
All those clumsy things
Send me up to the wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go
Where they don't know my name
Float all over the world
Just to see you again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armour
Might rust in the rain

A simple plot
But I know one day
Good things are coming our way (Repeat twice)

Oh yeah
