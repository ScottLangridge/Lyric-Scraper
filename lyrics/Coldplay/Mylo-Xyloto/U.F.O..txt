Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way, never heard, gone to the floor
It's just seems that upstream, I keep going
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

Then at last, it's your eyes
I move, I swim,
And found somewhere the streets I've been and gone
But it's fright, split the skies
But that's all right, sometimes, somewhere in the streets are holes

Oooohhh ooohh
