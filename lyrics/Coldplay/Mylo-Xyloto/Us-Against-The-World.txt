Oh morning come bursting, the clouds, they move
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
And bring back the water, that your ships rode in
In my heart you left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing slow-ow-ow-ow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's just us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend

My drunken as a Daniel iin a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
And lift off before trouble
Just erodes us in the rain (x3)

Sing slow-ow-ow-ow it down
Oh Slow-ow-ow-ow it down

Through chaos as it swirls
It's just us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
