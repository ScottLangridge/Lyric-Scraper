[Verse 1]
Once upon a time somebody ran,
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can.
I got to go, I got to go!
Once upon a time we fell apart,
You holding in your hands the two halves of my heart.
Oh oh. Oh oh!

Once upon a time we're burning bright,
Now all we ever seem to do is fight.
On and on, and on, and on, and on.
Once upon a time on the same side,
Once upon a time on the same side in the same game.
And why'd you have to go,
Have to go and throw it all in my face?

[Pre-Chorus]
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle and worn a ring,
But no, you let me go.
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king,
Could've had a castle and wore a ring,
But no, you let me go.

[Hook]
You stole my star, lalala la lala, lalala la lala, lala la lala.
You stole my star, lalala la lala.

[Outro]
Cause you really hurt me,
Oh, you really hurt me.
Cause you really hurt me,
Oh, you really hurt me.
Cause you really hurt me,
Oh, you really hurt me, oh.
You really hurt me,
Oh, you really hurt me.
Cause you really hurt me,
Oh, you really hurt me.
