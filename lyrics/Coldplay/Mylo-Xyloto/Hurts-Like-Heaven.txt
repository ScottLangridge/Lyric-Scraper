Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park,
Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?
It's so cold, so cold,
It's so cold, so cold.

Written up in marker on a factory sign,
I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine.
It's so cold, so cold,
It's so cold, so cold.

See the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart.
took the fire from my belly, and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go,
Still I won't let go.

You, yes, you do.
Oh you, use your heart as a weapon,
And it hurts like heaven.

On every street, every car, every surface are names,
And now the streets arise and we're writing the same.
Don't let them take control,
No, we won't let them take control.

Yes, I feel a little bit nervous,
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax.
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?

So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark,
On a concrete canvas I go making my mark.
Armed with the spray can soul,
I'll be armed with the spray can soul.

You, oh you 'cause you use your heart as a weapon,
And it hurts like heaven.

Whoa, whoa, it's true,
When you use your heart as a weapon,
And it hurts like heaven and it hurts like heaven.
