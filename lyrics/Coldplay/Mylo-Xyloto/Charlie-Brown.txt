I stole the key
I took the car downtown where the lost boys meet
I took the car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and they're standing in front of me

My scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
I'll be a bright red rose combusting the concrete
Be the cartoon heart
Light a fire from a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs

All the highs, all the lows
As the Room is spinning Oh
We'll run wild
We'll start glowing in the dark

So we saw an innocent liar
We'll be glowing in the dark
