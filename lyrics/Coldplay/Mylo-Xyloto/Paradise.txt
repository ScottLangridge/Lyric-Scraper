[Verse 1]
When she was just a girl,
She expected the world,
But it flew away from her reach so
She ran away in her sleep. 
And dreamed of 
Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise,
Every time she closed her eyes.

When she was just a girl,
She expected the world,
But it flew away from her reach 
And the bullets catch in her teeth. 
Life goes on, it gets so heavy,
The wheel breaks the butterfly. 
Every tear a waterfall,
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes,
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly.

[Chorus]
And dreams of
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
She'd dream of
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh 

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies,
She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise"

[Outro]
This could be
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
This could be
Para-para-paradise.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
This could be
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
This could be
Para-para-paradise,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
