[Verse 1]
Sat on a roof, named every star
Shed every bruise and showed every scar
Sat on a roof, your hand in mine, singing
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"

[Chorus]
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and all its weight"
Here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day

[Verse 2]
Sat on a roof, named every star and
Showed me a place where you can be who you are

[Chorus]
And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I'm drifting away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day

[Bridge]
And I asked every book, poetry and chime
"Can there be breaks in the chaos of times?"
Oh, thanks God, you must've heard when I prayed
Because now I always want to feel this way

[Outro]
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Today
