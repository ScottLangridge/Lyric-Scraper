Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up

See a pearl form a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, it's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain"
Up and up, up and up

Were gonna get it, get it together
Right now were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and flow
Were gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart

Yes I want to know, yes, I want to feel
Yes I want to grow, show me how to heal it up, heal it up

Try and see the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

Were gonna get it, get it together
Right now were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and flow
Were gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind, or take a risk
You can say "it's mine" and clench your fists
Or see each sunrise as a gift

Were gonna get it, get it together
Right now were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and flow
Were gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Were gonna get it, get it together
Right now were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and flow
Were gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When youre in pain, when you think you've had enough
Dont ever give up

Don't ever give up
Believe in love
