At night they would go walking 'til the breaking of the day,
The morning is for sleeping...
Through the dark streets they go searching to seek God in their own way,
Save the nighttime for your weeping...
Your weeping...

Singing la lalalala la l...
And the night over London lay.
So we rode down to the river where the Victoria ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken...
We'd go wandering neath the arches where the witches are and they say
There are ghost towns in the ocean...
The ocean...
Singing la lalalala la l...
And the night over London lay.

God is in the houses and God is in my head... and all the cemeteries in London...
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said,
For my heart, it wasn't open...
Not open...

Singing la lalalala la l...
And the night over London lay.
Singing la lalalala la l...
There's no light over London today.
