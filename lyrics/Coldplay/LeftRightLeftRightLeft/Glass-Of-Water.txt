So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Ohhhhhhhh I

Son, don't ask
Neither half full or empty is the glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
