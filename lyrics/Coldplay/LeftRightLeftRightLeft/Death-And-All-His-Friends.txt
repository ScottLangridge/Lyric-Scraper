All winter
We got carried
Oh
Way over on the rooftops
Let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over
Just be patient
And don't worry
So come over
Just be patient
And don't worry

So come over
Just be patient
And don't worry
And don't worry

No I don't wanna battle
From beginning to end
I don't wanna cycle
Recycle revenge
I don't wanna follow
Death and all his friends

No I don't wanna battle
From beginning to end
I don't wanna cycle
Recycle revenge
I don't wanna follow
Death and all of his friends
