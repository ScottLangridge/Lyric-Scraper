Oh no, I see,
A spiderweb is tangled up with me,
And I lost my head,
And thought of all the stupid things I said

Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle,
So I turned to run,
And thought of all the stupid things I've done.

And I never meant to cause you trouble,
Oh I never meant to do you wrong,
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble,
Oh, I never meant to do you harm.

Oh no, I see,
A spider web and it's me in the middle,
So I twist and turn,
But here I am in my little bubble.

And I never meant to cause you trouble,
Oh I never meant to do you wrong,
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble,
Oh I never meant to do you harm.

They spun a web for me,
They spun a web for me,
They spun a web for me,
They spun a web.
