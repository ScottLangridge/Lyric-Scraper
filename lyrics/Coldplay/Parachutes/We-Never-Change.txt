I wanna live life, never be cruel.
And I wanna live life, be good to you.
And I wanna fly, never come down.
And live my life, And have friends around.

We never change, do we? No no
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house.
I wanna live life, always be true.
Yeah I wanna live life, and be good to you.
I wanna fly, and never come down.
And live my life, and have friends around.

We never change, do we? No no
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house.
Where making more friends would be easy.

O I don't have a soul to save,
Yes, and I sing of a single day,

We never change do we?
We never learn do we?

So, I wanna live life in a wooden house,
Where making more friends would be easy,
I wanna live where the sun comes out
