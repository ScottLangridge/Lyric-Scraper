[Verse:]
Hey, you, what is the matter?
Tell me the truth, I wont laugh at you.
Where these words grew?
Were they unkind?
That guys a fool, hes crossed the line.

[Chorus:]
Ill stay with you
Till hell freezes over.
Were at to each other
Like sister and brother.
Youre one of a kind,
High on my agenda,
Oh, Ill change your mind,
When will you surrender?

[Verse:]
We never left in,
Your world felt unharmed
It cut like a blade
Right through your heart.
And where your friends
Just when you needed them?
They were not there,
Why did you believe in them?

[Chorus:]
Ill stay with you
Till hell freezes over.
Were at to each other
Like sister and brother.
Youre one of a kind,
High on my agenda,
Oh, Ill change your mind,
When will you surrender?

[Chorus:]
Ill stay with you
Till hell freezes over.
Were at to each other
Like sister and brother.
Youre one of a kind,
High on my agenda,
Oh, Ill change your mind,
When will you surrender?
When will you surrender?
