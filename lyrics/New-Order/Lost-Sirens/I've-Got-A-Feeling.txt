I don't wanna be on my own,
I can't get no sleep,
Things keep going wrong.
But the words inside my head,
They don't tell no lies,
We're hanging by a thread,
But still we gotta try.

Driving down the road,
Street lights flashing by me,
I just gonna go, leave this world behind me.
I want to be free, to do what I do best,
I just gotta run, can't afford to rest.

Something ain't right, I've got a feeling
Don't ask me why, but I've gotta leave here.
What can I do? Cause something it's changed,
I'm telling you, you're not the same.

Rain is falling down on my screen
Headlights on the road filling into scene.
But still my empty heart beats another day
I don't know where to start, I don't know what to say,
It's tearing me apart.

And all the time we had, there's no use looking back,
It only makes you sad, we've trimmed enough the track.
I'd say it to your face if you were here with me,
I'd put you in your place, cause you're not good for me.

Something ain't right, I've got a feeling
Don't ask me why, but I've gotta leave here.
What can I do? Cause something it's changed,
I'm telling you, you're not the same.
There wasn't a day that I wasn't true,
You were the one that I thought I knew.

You can't hurt me and you can't hold me
Why can't you see that you don't own me?

What can I do, something it's changed
I'm telling you that you're not the same.
People may come and people may go,
But yours was the love I've got to know.
