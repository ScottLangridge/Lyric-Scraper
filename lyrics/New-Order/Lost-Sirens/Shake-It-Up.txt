[Verse]
You get up in the early morning,
You never seen or feel like you wanna.
Look up and the sky is falling,
Its just another day or tomorrow.

Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You can make it real if you want it.
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You can turn the wheel if you wanna.

I loved you like you were no other,
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up.
I read your book from front to cover,
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up.

[Chorus]
Does it ever feel like your own life,
Watchin on TV like youre standing on the front line
And the papers saving it for later
Does it have ever feel like its real, like its true?
Does it ever?

Does it ever feel like your own life
Watchin on TV like youre standing on the front line
And the papers saving it for later
Does it have ever feel like its real, like its true?
Does it ever?

[Verse]
Do you need it? Do you want it?
Well rock you on that, we dont wanna wait.
Would you spend some money on it?
Well, I dont like the sound and I cant afford the rate.

Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
We can make a deal if you wanna.
Shake it up, yeah,
Shake it up, yeah,
You just gotta do what youve gotta.

I read your book from front to cover,
You comin all over like a piece of cake.
Still we chose to love each other
Hell theres no fool like the [?] [?].

[Chorus]
Does it have ever feel like your own life
Watchin on TV like youre standing on the front line
And the papers saving it for later
Does it have ever feel like its real, like its true?
Does it have ever?

Does it have ever feel like your own life
Watchin on TV like youre standing on the front line
And the papers saving it for later
Does it have ever feel like its real, like its true?
Does it have ever?

[Bridge]

Does it have ever feel like your own life
Watchin on TV like youre standing on the front line
And the papers saying that the later
Does it have ever feel like its real, like its true?
Does it have ever?
