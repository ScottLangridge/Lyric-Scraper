My eyes are weary all things are daily

I see the best take, the light of daybreak

It shines upon me, but sun I don't see

No reason ever was given

No reason ever was given

Two ides of recoil, this moment's glory

A faint reminder of a broken story

My vain emotions one day will find

No reason ever was given

No reason ever was given
