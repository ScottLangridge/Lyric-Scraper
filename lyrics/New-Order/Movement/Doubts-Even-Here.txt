Those steps which seem to take a lifetime

When eyes just turn and stare

The day begins, collapsing without warning

You fade from sight, there's nothing there



Oh don't go out, the halls are unsedated

The questions are on your side

Deeply moved, beyond all consolation

You felt the pulse, now turn and cry



In my mind, thoughts are becoming clearer

I'm watching every move you make

Counting time spent in observation

A single blow a false mistake



Can you read to me

All that I need to know now

(the close went down to times

Too, too much behind us)

Then please don't turn away,

Why can't I talk to you now?

(the number of forgotten years

Where my honor isn't deepest

Grows the deepest feeling and it

Grieved for safety and despair)

There's nowhere left to go

Where is this taking her and how?

(the torish threats forevermore

Over our natural favor

And us and he's and I'll fall

Far in it, and it sees enough

In our failures and it's not time.)

There's nothing more I want

To know beyond your trust now

(I missed his promised time again

For my friend)

Don't throw our joy away

Why must you just you leave now?

(has God forgotten to approach us?

Has he rememberd to not despise us? )

Memories are all that's left

I need you near to me now

(there, now, now, don't come to mind my deeds

And call out in defiance of times gone by)
