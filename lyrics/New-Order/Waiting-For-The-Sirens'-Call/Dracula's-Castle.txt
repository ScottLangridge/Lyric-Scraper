What's the matter here
Somethin' ain't right
Tell me it's not true
Tell me it's alright
There was a time I'd run around for you
Get down on my knees, I swear it's true
But you came in and? And took my heart to Dracula's castle in the dark
Now I gotta tell you, now you've gotta know
I want you to stay but you're gonna go
Don't leave me alone, you'll tear me apart
You're in control

So goodbye love you were not real
You came to stay but now you leave
I can't explain the way you feel
We walked so high but now we kneel

You can't keep on running
How far do you think you'll get
You got the world if you want it
I ain't done with you yet
I work hard just to keep you by my side
Every day and almost every night
In the end you took away my heart left me alone

So goodbye love you were not real
You came to stay but now you leave
I can't explain the way you feel
We walked so high but now we kneel

So goodbye love you were not real
You came to stay but now you leave
I can't explain the way you feel
We walked so high but now we kneel
