Hey Joe what' you doing?
It seems like it's all going wrong
There's a storm in the sky passing over
And it looks like it's going to be strong
You've got eyes like an old wounded soldier
They cry tears to the lost in the wind

Hey Joe
Hey Joe
Hey Joe
What you gonna do?

I looked for you
I'll get you home
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I've got to find you
I've got to find you (Whatever you do)

I looked for you
I'll take you there
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I've got to find you
Whatever I do (Whatever you do)

Hey Joe what' you doing?
They say you don't care anymore
You had your heart hurt by a woman
Now it doesn't work anymore
She said that you had it coming
That you were no good from the start

Hey Joe
Hey Joe
Hey Joe
Time to go home

I looked for you
I'll get you home
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I've got to find you
I've got to find you (Whatever you do)

I looked for you
I'll take you there
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I've got to find you
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)
Whatever I do (Whatever I do)
