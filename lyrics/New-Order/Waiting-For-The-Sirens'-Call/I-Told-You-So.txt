It's been ten long years since I've been home
I've been waiting here with nowhere to go
It's an occupation I don't like
But it pays the rent and turns on the light

(alright)
I told you so
It has to be
Cut loose and runaway with me
We'll go out every night
I'll be there by your side
And we'll all get high down the os(?)side

If it ain't the job and it ain't the place
But I must stay for your pretty face
It's a fuck reaction I can't fix
You caught me with those feline tricks

I told you so
It's a crazy world
For a mixed up guy
And an awkward girl

And I told you so
It's a crazy world
For a mixed up guy
With an awkward girl

(Take her, take the world)

I told you so
It has to be
Cut loose news and runaway (runaway) with me
We'll go out every night
I'll be there by your side
And we'll all get high down the os side

(Take the world)
