Nothing in this world
Can touch the music that I heard
When I woke up this morning
It put the sun into my life
It cut my heartbeat with a knife
It was like no other morning

I don't belong to noone
But I want to be with you
I can't be owned by noone
What am I supposed to do

I can't see the sense in your leaving
All I need is your love to believe in

Don't look into the sun
[Dream Attack lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]It's not for me or anyone
To steal the light out of the sky
Is it really such a sin
'cause if it is then I'll give in
I can't live without your love

I don't belong to noone
But I want to be with you
I can't be owned by noone
What am I supposed to do

I can't see the sense in your leaving
All I need is your love to believe in
And for you I would do what I can
But I can't change the way that I am
