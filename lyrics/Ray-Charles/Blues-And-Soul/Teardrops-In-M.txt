1) you? L never know I cried, when I found out you
Lied

For I've been hangin on this teardrops in my heart

2) my eyes dare not reveal, the way I realy feel

Because I know I? L cry my heart out if I start

* Though I'm pretending, that I don't care

To be with you my darlin, is my prayer

3) but way down deep inside, I can't give up my pride

So Ill just keep on hiding teardrops in my heart

(solo piano)

3) repeat
