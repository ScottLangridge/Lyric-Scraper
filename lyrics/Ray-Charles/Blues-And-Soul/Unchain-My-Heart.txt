Unchain my heart, baby let me be
Unchain my heart 'cause you don't care about me
You've got me sewed up like a pillow case
but you let my love go to waste so
Unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

Unchain my heart, baby let me go
Unchain my heart, 'cause you don't love me no more
Ev'ry time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home so
Unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

I'm under your spell like a man in a trance
But I know darn well, that I don't stand a chance so
Unchain my heart, let me go my way
Unchain my heart, you worry me night and day
Why lead me through a life of misery
when you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

Unchain my heart, you worry me night and day
Why lead me through a life of misery
when you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart, please, please set me free
(please set me free)
Oh won't you set me free
(please set me free)
Woah, set me free
(please set me free)
Woowow, set me free little darlin
(please set me free)
Oh won't you set me free
