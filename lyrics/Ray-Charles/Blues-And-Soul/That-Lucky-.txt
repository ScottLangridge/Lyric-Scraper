Up in the mornin', out on the job
I work like the devil for my pay
I know that lucky old sun
Has nothin' to do
But to roll around heaven all day
I fuss with my woman and I toy with my kids
I sweat til I'm wrinkled and gray
I know that lucky old sun
Has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Yea, Lord above don't you see I'm pinin'
I got tears all in my eyes
Why don't you send down that cloud
With the silver linin'
Lift me up to paradise.
Show me that river
Why don't you take me across
And wash all my troubles away
I know that lucky old sun
He's got nothin' to do
But just roll around heaven all day.
Send down that cloud
With the silver linin'
Lift me up to paradise
Show me that river
And take me across
Wash all my troubles away
And I know the lucky old sun
He's got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Yes sir, he got nothin'
But roll around heaven all day.
I say he just roll around heaven all day.
Now you say it...
(with chorus)
Roll around heaven all day.
(Solo speaking) Yes Lord...
