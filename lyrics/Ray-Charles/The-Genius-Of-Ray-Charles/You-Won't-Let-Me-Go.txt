1) I want you, I need you, I'm all packed up to go

But darlin, if you love me, you wont let me go

2) if a love? A true love, it never runs smooth you
know

So if your love is a true love, you wont let me go

* If you don't say you love me, I'm gonna walk right
out the door

And I'll hope that you? L stop me, so I can hear you
call me darlin once more

3) I tell you I love you, yes I love you

With all my heart and soul, so darlin if you love me

You wont let me go

(solo piano)

4) hey I love you now, I say I love you

Oh with all my heart and soul

So darlin well if you love me

I know you wont let me go

Girl I know you wont let me go
