Come on and hear Come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band,
Come on and hear Come on and hear, it's the best band in the land!
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before, So natural that you
Want to go to war-- That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb!
Come on along, Come on along, let me take you by the hand Up to the man, Up to
The man who's the leader of the band, And if you want to hear the Swanee River
Played in ragtime Come on and hear, Come on and hear, Alexander's Ragtime
Band!
