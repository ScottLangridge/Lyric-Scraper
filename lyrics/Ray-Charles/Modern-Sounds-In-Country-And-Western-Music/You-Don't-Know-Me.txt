(You dont love me, ooh, you dont know me)
You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Hello"
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
(No, you dont know me)

No, you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
Ooh, I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
Cause you don't know me
(No, you dont know me)

Oh, I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too
(Love me too)

You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye"
I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never, never know
The one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me

(For I never knew the art of making love)
(Though my heart aches with love for you)
Afraid and shy, I, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too
(Love me too)

Oh, you give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye"
I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never, never know
The one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me
(You dont love me, you dont know me)
