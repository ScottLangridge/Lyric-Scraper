Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once
In a lullaby

Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star and
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere, over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh, why can't I?

Somewhere, over the rainbow bluebirds fly, yeah
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh, why can't I?

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh, why can't I?
