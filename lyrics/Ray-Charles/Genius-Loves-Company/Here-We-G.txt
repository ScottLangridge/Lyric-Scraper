[Norah Jones]
Here we go again
He's back in town again
I'll take him back again
One more time

[Ray Charles]
Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again, I will
One more time

[Norah Jones]
I've been there before
And I will try it again
Any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win
Here we go again
She'll break my heart again, yeah
I'll play the part again
One more time
(Hi, Mr. President)
I've been there before, you know what?
I will try it again

[Norah Jones]
But any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win

[Together]
Here we go again
She'll break my heart again, yeah
I'll play the part again
One more time
I'll take her back again
One more time

[Ray Charles]
I will
