1) You got me cryin again, you got me cryin again

What is this love all about, I'm in and then I'm out

2) your kisses right from the start,

They came from your lips not your heart

You made me happy and then, somebody new looks good
to you

You got me cryin again, just cryin for you

(solo piano)

2) repeat
