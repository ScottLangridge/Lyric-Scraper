1) (I need someone to say I do)

No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight

No one to tell my troubles to

2) I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me
Tight

No one to chear me when I'm blue

*  When I go home to my lonely room

And find there? No one there

And each night I think of you, so please answer this
One prayer

3) and you? L need someone, I said to cry to

Someone to say I do

Someone to whisper I love you

* (raelletes) repeat

3) repeat
