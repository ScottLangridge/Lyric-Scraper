Did all the words I never said,
Hurt as bad as those I did?
You know I never even cared,
Not before you

If I could go and turn back time
If I could only press rewind,
I would bleed this heart of mine,
Just to show you

And I'll be the first to say I'm sorry,
The first to say I'm stupid
Why do I always take you there?
Is it hopeless?
Or maybe you still want to,
Meet me at the altar?
And I will lay it all to bed

And I told you,
All my secrets, all my fears
I've let go
And it's flawless,
You are the only one
You are the only one, Don't you know?
Don't you know?

Am I fading from your mind?
Has the distance blurred the lines?
They say all things heal with time
But it's untrue
I will linger on every word
I know it's more than I deserve
Chances are, I'll make it worse
But I need to, tell you

Tell you that I'm sorry
Tell you, that I'm stupid
Why do I always take it there?
Is it hopeless?
Or maybe you still want to, meet me at the altar?
And I will lay it all to bed

And I told you,
All my secrets, all my fears
I've let go
And it's flawless,
You are the only one
You are the only one, Don't you know?
Don't you know?
That the heart is cold, not having you to hold
Don't you know?
This old heart of mine can better see now you're gone

And I told you,
All my secrets, all my fears
I've let go
And it's flawless,
You are the only one
You are the only one,
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
