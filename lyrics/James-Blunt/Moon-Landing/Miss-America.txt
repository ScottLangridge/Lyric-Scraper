Did someone give you something to help you ease the pain?
Like the liquor in the bottle, we watched you slip away.
And I feel as if I know you through the bars of a song.
Always surrounded but alone.

But no goodbyes, youll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly, but nothings free Miss America.
And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
Was it so hard to breathe?

Was the picture in the paper not the face you recognise?
Did the make up never make up for the pain behind your eyes?
Cos I feel as if I know when youre on my silver screen
But I dont know the dark places that youve been.

But no goodbyes, youll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly, but nothings free Miss America.
And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
Was it so hard to breathe?

Does another voice sing in Heavens choir tonight, 
To fill the silence left behind?
And I dont know what goes on in your mind
Im sure its enough to make my cry.
Someday well find you lived forever.

But no goodbyes, youll always be Miss America.
We watched you fly, but nothings free Miss America.
And as you fall apart, we just call it art.
Was it so hard to breathe?
