Don't I know it
Nobody has to say
I've been lucky
Guess I was born that way

I thank my father
His absence has made me strong
And I love my mother
But she had troubles with God

No tears

For the life that you led
You had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end?

All the things that do seem
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I wanna be
So no tears, no tears for me

Yeah I've bathed in sunshine
But cherished the fading light
And I heard my heartbeat falter
On a winters night
I loved a woman
But she didn't hear my prayers
So lord, oh lord, I'm yours

And no tears

For the life that you led
You had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end?
All the things that do seem
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I wanna be

So no tears, no tears

Because someone somewhere's going home tonight
Try to understand the sacrifice
So save your tears for those left behind

For the life that you led
You had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end?
All the things that do seem
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I wanna be

So no tears
No tears
No tears for me
