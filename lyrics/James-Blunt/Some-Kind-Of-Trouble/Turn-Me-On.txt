I'm a boy, she's a girl
And we're all doing this around the world
Catch her eye and count to five
And remember everybody dies
I'm not her friend, no I'm not second best
I'll send her home unless they're both in it together,
And they're both on each other,
That's my kind of party, that's my kind of party

Cos I'm a boy, she's a girl,
And we're all doing this around the world,
Around the world, around the world, around the world,

So, why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on,
Why get complicated?
You know you wanna turn me on.

Underwater with someones daughter,
Gonna make you a dirty woman,
And when we're both in it together,
And we're both on each other,
That's my kind of party, that's my kind of party

Cos I'm a boy, she's a girl,
And we're all doing this around the world,
Around the world, around the world, around the world,

So, why get complicated? You know you wanna turn me on,
Why get complicated? You know you wanna turn me on,

Why get complicated? You know you wanna turn me on,
Why get complicated? You know you wanna turn me on,
Why get complicated? You know you wanna turn me on,
Why get complicated? You know you wanna turn me on,
