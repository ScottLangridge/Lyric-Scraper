This time her mind is made up
Yeah, she's moving on
It's not like her spirit's crushed
It's just she don't belong

Maybe she just thinks too much
She thinks she's given enough
God only knows she's got a heart of gold

Always looking for love
She's beginning to think she's cursed
On her looks she judged
By the folks at work
All alone at night she's cried 
silent tears filled with pride
one day they'll know
She's got a heart of gold
Chorus:
And she sings, I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold

Been coming 'round here
Since she's a little girl
But now the change is clear
We live in a cynical world
She don't care for fashion and fame,
Those kind of people they are all the same
They don't wanna know, she's got a heart of gold

Chorus:
And she sings, "I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold"

To see her footsteps in the snow

Chorus:
And she sings, "I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold"
