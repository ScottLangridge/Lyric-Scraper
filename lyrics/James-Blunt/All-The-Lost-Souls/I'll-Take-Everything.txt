Oh these feet carry me far. Oh my body. Oh so tired.
Mouth is dry. Hardly speak. Holy Spirit rise in me.
Here I swear, forever is just a minute to me.
I'll take everything in this life.
I'll join everyone when I die.
Have my body. Have my mind. Have my coat. Take my time.
These I borrow. Borrow so far. Turn to dust. Fall apart.
Here I swear, forever is just a minute to me.
I'll take everything in this life.
I'll join everyone and understand.
'Cause all men die. 'Cause all men die.
I'll take everything in this life
I'll join everyone since I'm gonna die
I'll take everything in this life
I'll join everyone 'cause all men die
