Many prophets preach on bended knee
Many clerics wasted wine
Through those bloody sheets
On those cobbled streets
I have wasted time

Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy untold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that
If fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you
I really want you

Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or when mother earth complain
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain

They say a million people bow and scream
To an effigy of gold
As so life begin
And the shit we're in
And history unfold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that
If fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart (2x)
