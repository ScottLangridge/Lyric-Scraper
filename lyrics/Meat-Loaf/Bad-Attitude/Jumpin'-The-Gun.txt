Heaven blesses those who wait, patience is a virtue, son
Keep your toe on the line, keep your foot on the brake
No sense jumpin' the gun
But girl I'm tired of waitin', you know life's too short
Lemme kiss ya 'til the night is done
Ain't no doubt about it, you're my favourite sport, God I wanna jump the gun

Chorus:

Feel like jumpin' the gun, tonight I'm gonna jump the gun
No crime in havin' some fun, how about jumpin' the gun

[Chorus:]

Now they say it doesn't matter if ya win or lose
Only matters how ya play the game
Well, but let me tell ya baby, if I had to choose
Gotta win ya now or go insane

[Chorus:]

Willya hold me like a trophy, willya burn up the track
Willya love me when the title's won
Blow away the competition baby, never look back, honey willya jump the gun

Girl:<

Gonna hold ya like a trophy, gonna burn up the track
Gonna love ya when the title's won
They'll be eatin' up the dust baby, never look back
Tonight I'm gonna jump

Better get ready, better get set girl - this time we're jumpin' the gun
Ya think we're goin' too fast, ain't seen nothin' yet girl
This time we're jumpin' the gun
Ready take your mark, ooh I just can't wait - this time we're jumpin' the gun
Ya gotta break a couple rules if ya wanna break the tape
This time we're jumpin' the gun

(chorus repeats out)
