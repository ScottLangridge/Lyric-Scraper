You see me now as large as life
But underneath you knew all too well
The hollow shell no spark of life
Where once upon a time there beat a heart for you
And you knew it from the start
But you went and blew it all away

And you knew how, yeah you knew best
The strings to pull and the buttons to press
To wind me up and make me shake
You controlling every move I make
I couldn't see through it
All the pain
And you put me through it
Over and over again
Over and over ...

How could you say there was no other
Why is it nothing's what it seems
You told me I'm your greatest lover
Do you even know what that word means
You lovin' is coolin'
Baby who d'ya think you're foolin'
Cuz when I woke up
I caught you cheatin' in your dreams

Stop it, stop it
Don't you say a word
I felt my hands around her neck
And everything went blurred
Broken, broken
She slipped from out my hands
She lay so still and lifeless
I cried baby, baby, baby ...

How could you say there was no other
Why is it nothing's what it seems
You told me I'm your greatest lover
Do you even know what that word means
Your lovin' is coolin'

Baby who d'ya hink you're foolin'
Cuz when I woke up
I caught you cheatin' in your dreams
Cheatin', cheatin'
Cheatin' in your dreams
It was my dumb luck
I just came unstuck
When my whole world shook
I'd had about enough
Cuz when I woke up
I caught you cheatin' in your dreams
