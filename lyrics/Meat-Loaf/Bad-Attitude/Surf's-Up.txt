The waves are poundin' on the sand tonight
I want to take your hand and make it feel so right
I know I'm ready and I'll never be like this again
And the sky is trembling and the moon is pale
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail
I know you're ready and we're runnin' on the back of the wind
And my body is burnin' like a naked wire
I wanna turn on the juice
I wanna fall in the fire
I'm gonna drown in the ocean in a bottomless sea
I'm gonna give you all I'm hopin' you'll be givin' to me
And when the waves are poundin' on the sand tonight
I wanna take your hand and make it good and make it right
Wow the sky is trembling and the moon is pale
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail

How hard
How hard
How hard do I gotta try
(I want all of your love)
Surf's up
(I need it so bad)
Surf's up
(I need it so bad)
Surf's up and so am I
(I gotta give you some love)
Surf's up
And so am I

My body is burnin' like a naked wire
I wanna turn on the juice
I wanna fall in the fire
I'm gonna drown in the ocean in a bottomless sea
I'm gonna give you all I'm hopin' you'll be givin' to me
And when the waves are poundin' on the sand tonight
I wanna take your hand and make it good and make it right
Wow the sky is trembling and the moon is pale
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail

How hard
How hard
How hard do I gotta try
(I want all of your love)
Surf's up
(I need it so bad)
Surf's up
(I need it so bad)
Surf's up and so am I
(I gotta give you some love)
Surf's up
And so am I

Surf's up
And so am I

Surf's up
And so am I
