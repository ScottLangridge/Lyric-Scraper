Every night I grab some money
And I go down to the bar
I got my buddies and a beer
I got a dream - I need a car
You got me begging on my knees
C'Mon and throw this dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by
Rock 'n'Roll and brew alone

Baby, Baby
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
They don't mean a thing
When I compare  next to you

Rock 'n' Roll and brew
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
I know that you and I
We got better things to do

I don't know who you are or what you do
Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are
But you're a real dead ringer for love
You're a real dead ringer for love

Ever since I can remember
You been hanging around this joint
You been trying to look away
But now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name
And I won't tell you what to do
But a girl - she doesn't live by only
Rock 'n' Roll and brew

Baby, Baby, baby, Baby
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
They don't mean a thing
When I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
I know that you and I
We got better things to do

I don't know who you are or what you do
Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are
But you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

Oooo You got the kind of legs
That do more tan walk
I don't have to listen
To your whimpering talk
Listen you got the kind of eyes
That do more than see
You gotta lot of nerve
Coming on to me
You got the kind of lips
That do more than drink
You got the kind of mind
That does less than think
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely
And my defenses are low
Why don't we give it shot
And get ready to go
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction
And I want to tell my Daddy that I'll be missing in action

Ever since I can remember
I've been hanging around this joint
My Daddy never noticed it
Now he finally got the point
You got me beggin' on my knees
C'Mon and throw this dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by
Rock 'n' Roll and brew alone

Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
I know that you and I
Oh we got better things to do

Rock 'n' Roll and brew
Rock 'n' Roll and brew
They don't mean a thing
When I compare 'em next to you

I don't know who you are
Or what you do
Or where you go
When you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby
But you're everything I'm dreaming of

I don't know who you are
But you're a real dead ringer for love
You're a real dead ringer for love
