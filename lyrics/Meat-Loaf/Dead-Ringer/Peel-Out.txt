Everyday of my life they say the same old thing
Hey boy!-(oh boy)- you better wait your turn
And everyday of my life I get the same old line
Hey boy!-(oh boy)- when are you going to learn

I wanna go on the red- I wanna go on the green
I wanna go on all colors that I see in between
I wanna run all the tolls- I wanna run all the signs
I wanna run all the way across a double white line

But everyday of my life I see the same old road
Hey girl! - (oh girl) - we gotta pull up our routes
And everyday of my life I see the same old dreams
Hey girl! - (oh girl) - I need a dream I can use

I wanna go on the red - I wanna go on the green
I wanna go on all colors that I see in between
I wanna run all the tolls - I wanna run all the signs

My body is the car and my soul is the ignition
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we-
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!
We're sick and tired of waiting in line
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!
Nobody's taking our time
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!

Tire tracks and broken hearts that's all we're leaving behind
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime
There oughta be a law and there better be a crime

And every night of my life there's something holding me back
Hey girl! - (What is it boy) - I know it's time to cut loose
And every night of my life I dream of someone like you
Hey girl! - (What is it boy) - you got a dream I can use

My body is the car and my soul is the ignition
Your love will be the key and we'll jockey for position till we -
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!
We're sick and tired of waiting in line
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!
Nobody's taking our time
Peel out! Peel out! Peel out!
