From the very first moment I saw you I knew our love would be so
strong
And the very first moment I kissed you I knew our joy would last so
long

And then I saw you making love to my best friend
I didn't kow whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said
Listen boy

Won't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me I won't throw you no curves
Have yourself a ball with my good women
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve

When I saw you hanging round the truck stop
Shining like an angel in the night
And when I saw you crying like a baby I knew you'd have to be my
wife

Then I saw you making love to my best friend
I didn't kow whatever to say
I saw you making love to my best friend
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said
Listen boy

Won't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me I won't throw you no curves
Go on have yourself a ball with my good women
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve

Now I think I'm going to have to leave you
Because I'm feeling much to weak to share
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces
The flavor that I crave is no longer there

Then I saw you making love to my best friends
I didn't kow whatever to say
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said
Listen here, group

Won't you take some more, it's what you came for
And don't mind me I won't throw you no curves
Go on have yourself a ball with my good women
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve
