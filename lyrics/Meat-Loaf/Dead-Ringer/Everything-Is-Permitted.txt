Everything is permitted
Everything is allowed
And all our Gods we have outwitted
We are running with the crowd
And all the clocks are showing zero
And all our parents must have fled
And we just never had no hereos
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead

Everything is permitted
There is nothing out of bounds
There are no limits or no fences
There is always some way around
And all the compass points are zero
And all the navigators fled
And we just never had no hereos
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead

If everything is permitted
If nothing ever is taboo
Then there is always something shattered
When there is something breaking thru

And all the clocks are showing zero
And all our parents must have fled
And we just never had no hereos
And all our enemies will soon be stone cold dead

If everything is permitted
If nothing is taboo
Then there is always something shattered
When there is something breaking thru
Then there is always something shattered
When there is something breaking thru
Everything is permitted
