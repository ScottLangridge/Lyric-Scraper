(Spoken)
BOY: On a hot summer night,
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
GIRL: Will he offer me his mouth?
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: Will he offer me his teeth?
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: Will he offer me his jaws?
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: Will he offer me his hunger?
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: Again, will he offer me his hunger?
BOY: Yes!
GIRL: And will he starve without me?
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: And does he love me?
BOY: Yes
GIRL:Yes
BOY: On a hot summer night,
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
GIRL: Yes.
BOY: I bet you say that to all the boys!

(Sung)
It was a hot summer night
And the beach was burning.
There was fog crawling over the sand.
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning.
I see the shooting stars falling
Through your trembling hands.

You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste.

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak.
But my soul is flying high above the ground.
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin.
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to.
The night is young
And ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been.
You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining.
I was dying just to ask for a taste.
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon.
You know there's not another moment to waste.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true,
I was just about to say I love you.
And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
And I swear it's true, I was just about to say I love you.

And then you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Oh, you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Well, you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Well, you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Well well hell yeah.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
Well, you took the words right out of my mouth.
(Must've been while you we're kissing)
You took the words right out of my mouth,
Well it must've been while you we're kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth,
Oh, it must've been while you we're kissing me...
(Fades out)
