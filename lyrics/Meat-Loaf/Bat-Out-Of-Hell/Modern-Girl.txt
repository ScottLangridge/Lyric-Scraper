Once a beautiful Miss America married Mr. Right

Had a little baby girl born on a stormy night.
But that was once upon a time
Now it's a brand new world.

Gimme the future
Gimme the future

Gimme the future with a modern girl.
Gimme the future
Gimme the future

Gimme the future with a modern girl.

Somewhere just between the past and somethin' dawnin' new

There's a break in the chain
A skip in the clock

Girl
That's where I'm gonna find you.
Between the boy I was before and what I'm gonna be

There's a clash on the border
A flame in the sky

Girl
That's where you're gonna find me.

Can't you hear the planet groanin' like a broken down machine

Rusted with the guilty tears of fallen kings and queens.
But you and I stand innocent
Baby
It's a brand new world.

Gimme the future

Gimme the future with a modern girl.

We're the son and the daughter on a new freeway

Gimme the future
Gimme the future.
Oh
Laughin'
While the road maps blow away

Gimme the future with a modern girl.
We're the son and the daughter
And we ain't afraid

Gimme the future
Gimme the future.
Won't be makin' the mistakes
Our fathers made

Gimme the future with a modern girl.
Gimme the future
Gimme the future

Gimme the future with a modern girl.
