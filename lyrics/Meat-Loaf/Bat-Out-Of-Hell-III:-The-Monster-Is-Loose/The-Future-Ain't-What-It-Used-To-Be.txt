[Boy:]
I never knew so many bad times
Could follow me so mercilessly
It's almost surreal all the pain that I feel
The future ain't what it used to be

It doesn't matter what they're thinking
It doesn't matter what they're thinking of me
It's always so cold and I'm to young to be old
The future ain't what it used to be

Were there ever any stars in the sky?
And did the sun ever shine so bright?
Do you have any dreams I could borrow
Just to get me through the lonely nights?

Is there anything left to hold on to
When the rivers wash it all away?
Is there anyone left to hold on to?
Is there anything left I can say?

Say a prayer for the falling angels
Stem the tide of the rising waters
Toll a bell for the broken hearted
Burn a torch for your sons and daughters

The endless night has got a hold of me
Dark days are pulling me forward
And all these tears are washing over me
And I'm crying - I'm lost forever
In a future that ain't what it used to be
A future that ain't what it used to be
A future that ain't what it used to be no more...
(no more, no more, no more)

[Girl:]
It's like a storm that's never ending
It's like a shadow on the land and the sea
There's nothing so sad as a tomorrow gone bad
The future ain't what it used to be, now

[Boy:]
Some days I feel so numb and empty
And those would be the good days for me
[Both:]
Nothing gets to me now unless I'm thinking of how
The future ain't what it used to be

In a future that ain't what it used to be
A future that ain't what it used to be
A future that ain't what it used to be no more
[Girl:] No more, no more, no more, no more
[Boy:] No more
[Girl:] No more, no more, no more, no more...
[Boy:] No more, no more, no more, no more...

The future just ain't what it used to be
The future just ain't what it used to be
The future just ain't what it used to be
Oh, the future just ain't what it used to be
[Girl:] The future that ain't what it used to be no more...
Oh, the future just ain't what it used to be
[Girl:] The future that ain't what it used to be no more...
Hmmm, the future just ain't what it used to be
[Girl:] Aaah, the future, the future, the future, the future...
Oh, the future, the future, the future just ain't what it used to be
(the future just ain't what it used to be)
Oh, future just ain't what it used to be
Aaaaah, the future just ain't what it used to be
[Girl:] The future...

[Both:]
I wish it wouldn't come
I wish it wouldn't come
