If God could talk
Would He tell you to come back to me?
If God could talk
Would He tell you it's alright, just leave
And don't look back at all the memories
The best of times, the mess you made of me
Walk on, if you think it's gonna make you strong

Why don't you run away
And find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page
Before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart?

If God could talk
Would He part the oceans straight to you
Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through
Another day, another night alone
Stepping out into the great unknown tonight
Even God knows, baby, that ain't right

Why don't you run away
And find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page
Before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin' you apart?
If only God could talk

Did you swear to yourself
On the day it was over
That you'd never turn around
And get locked up in another cage?

Did you tear all the pictures
Of us living life together
Did you burn all the mem'ries
That have been made in a fit of rage?

Why don't you run away
And find yourself alive
Go on and turn the page
Before your lonely world collides
What's it gonna take to break the silence
That's been tearin you apart?
If only God could talk
If only God could talk
If only God could talk
If only God could talk

Oooh, would you listen now if God could talk?
