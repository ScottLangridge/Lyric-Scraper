I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that greyhound and rode it into Raleigh
And on across Caroline

I had motor trouble that turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabama
And that 'Hound broke down and left me all
Stranded in Downtown Birmingham

Right away I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' across Mississippi clean
And I was on the Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham
Smokin' into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston Town
I have people there who care a little about me
And they won't let a poor boy down

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
And good luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the Terminal gate
Swing low, chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the Terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia Tidewater 4-10-09
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
And the poor boy is on the line

You got to swing low chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the Terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia Tidewater 4-10-09
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
and the poor boy is on the line

And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin'
and the big boy is on the line
