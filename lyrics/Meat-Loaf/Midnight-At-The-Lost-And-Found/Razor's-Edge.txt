Never callin', unanswered letters how you been, feelin' better?
Never lookin', but you're hearin' never speakin', but you're
Feeling
All the silence, and it's wounding you're not healing, just
Conceding
Play the game, play the game.

Oh brother to brother all the blood runs red
Don't roll over, don't play dead
We're all livin' on the razor's edge
Oh brother to brother all the blood runs ruby red
We're all victims of the razor's edge

All the rules don't mean a thing
They're wasting time, the mem'ries sting
Keep your image, plant that smile
Answer questions, don't let on
Make up stories all put on
That's your life, ohh your life is gone

You see you're losing, yet you still try
The game just a watches your life go by
You're playin' well, you're playin' --
Why? Ohh Play the game

You see you're losing, yet you still try
The game just a watches your life go by
You're playin' well
Ohh, you're playin' the game

Oh brother to brother all the blood runs red
Don't roll over, don't play dead
We're all livin' on the razor's edge
Oh brother to brother all the blood runs ruby red
We're all victims of the razor's edge
