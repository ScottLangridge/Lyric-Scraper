Another New York waltz at four a.m., in the canyons lost at night
The city's just a jail for me, full of high rise prison walls
And I'm riding through this darkness, 'cause I know there's life within
And I'm searching through the shadows, just to find that light again
Keep driving (keep driving), let the meter run
Keep driving (keep driving), oh the night's not really done
Keep driving
And I'm hanging on a memory, and I feel it in the air
I'm a prisoner of these lonely streets, but I know I'll find you there
And oh Lord, you look so pretty, but you can see it in my eyes
And just before my tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside
It seems so real until the light turns green
Don't wake me up, don't ruin this dream, don't take me from my scene
Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone
(Solo)
They don't tell you when the music stops, or how the movie ends
Is it too late once the feeling's gone, to back it up and start it all again?
Oh Lord you look so pretty, and you can see it in my eyes
And just before that tear will fall, oh you smile and get inside
(Keep driving) keep driving, driving
I can't go home, don't take me home, I can't go home alone
(Keep driving) let the meter run, (keep driving) don't take me home
(Keep driving) ooh, the night's still young
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone, (keep driving) I gotta find someone
(Keep driving) I gotta find someone, (keep driving) I gotta find someone
(Keep driving) ooh find someone, (keep driving) I gotta find someone
(Keep driving) find someone, (keep driving) find someone
(Keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving, keep driving)
