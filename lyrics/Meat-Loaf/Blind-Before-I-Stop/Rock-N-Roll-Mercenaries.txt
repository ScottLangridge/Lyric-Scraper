(talking, talking - wealth, talking - money, talking - power
Talking - horses, talking - fun, talking - self, talking - power
Talking - diamonds, talking - ego, talking - man, talking - wealth)
(and talking - power) (repeats)

Money is power, power is fame

Chorus:

Talking about rock 'n' roll mercenaries
Soldiers of fortune by some other name
I'm talking about rock 'n' roll mercenaries
Money is power, 'n' power is fame

Everything you pay to hear - just listen
Everything to catch your ear - just listen
Whatever it takes, they're ready to sell
Anything and everything they do it themselves

(chorus)

Young are the victims so easily [swayed/slain]
[as some given are poisoned, all continuous placed]
Our conscience is a load, so heavy to carry, for a rock 'n' roll mercenary

(chorus)

It starts with a game, see how they play
Till all of the laughter is faded away
It's not for the song, it's not for the love
It's just for the gold and there's never enough - never enough

(chorus)

It's not for the song, it's not for the love
It's just for the gold, there's never enough

(chorus)

(rock 'n' roll mercenaries)

(talking, talking) (repeats out)

Rock 'n' roll mercenaries - ooh, talkin' about
Rock 'n' roll mercenaries... (to fade)
