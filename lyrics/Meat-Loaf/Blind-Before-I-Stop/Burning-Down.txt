If it takes them so long, so long to say yes,
Why don't they just say no
We don't need anyone to be put to the test,
Why don't they let us be
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right
Livin' for the right to be free

We needed a plan, we needed defenses,
They couldn't raise a smile
As the world looked down, they raided our senses,
There can be no reconcile
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down

There was a time in our life was taken for granted,
It'll never come again
Our flower is dead, the seed is unplanted,
They put it all to the flame
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down
Burnin' down, burnin' down
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down... (to fade)
