She thought she had the only key
She thought you only opened up to her,
Well you see I don't know why you call it love
She thought she was the brightest light
But someone else was lighting up your life,
What I think I don't know why you call it love
I'm not suspicious, no not me,
But I'm not blind And I'd have to be not to see

Gettin' away with murder,
You can love a girl and hurt her
That's gettin' away with,
Gettin' away with murder
You can tell a girl you love her,
While you're working on another
That's gettin' away with,
Gettin' away with murder

You have had to love and run
Two in the hand has left you holding none,
And I don't I don't know how you call it love, no, no
You're not demanding, no not you,
You're understanding
You do what you wanna do
You said she was the only one,
But you were cheating all along
There ought to be a law for what you've done
I got to save you from yourself,
I got to stop you from hurtin' someone else
