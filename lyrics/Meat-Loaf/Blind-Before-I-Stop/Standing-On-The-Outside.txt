I ain't livin' here no more, I ain't even keepin' score
It's too late to change, it's over, I'm drownin' in a sea of tears
Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference
There ain't nothin' I can do, none of it's makin' sense
Standing on the outside - I'm lookin' in at you
Standing on the outside
Standing on the outside - I'm running out of time
Standing on the outside

I'm so tired of bein' alone in a world that feels so cold
There's got to be a light that I can find
There's got to be a soul somewhere that shines for me
Now I don't want to live without love anymore,
I just wanna live my life
Love's gonna open up the door, show me it's light again
Nothin' I can say to you makes any difference
There ain't nothin' I can do, none of it's makin' sense
Standing on the outside - I'm lookin' in at you
Standing on the outside
Standing on the outside - what can I do
Standing on the outside
Standing on the outside - I'm lookin' in at you
Standing on the outside - yes I'm lookin' in at you
Standing on the outside - I'm lookin' in at you... (to fade)
