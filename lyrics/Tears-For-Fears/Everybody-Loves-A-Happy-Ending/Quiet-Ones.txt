It's always the quiet ones

Who are stranger than fiction

They hide under tables like a child


What kind of chemistry is it?

Leaden or golden?

Nobody sees them driving us wild


It's your life

Don't just collide with the waves


Oh look into her eyes

You'll see such silent calling

Nothing seems to matter in this life


Wake up your majesty there are

Thieves in the temple

Picking the sunspots out of the sun


Looking for symmetry in another dead Beatle

Down through the pathways see how they run


It's your life

Don't just collide with the waves


Oh look into her eyes

You'll see such silent calling

Nothing seems to matter in this life


Oh so many reasons why

You'll hear the sirens calling

Nothing seems to matter in this life


Oh salvation shine a light on a different world

And carry our thoughts on golden rays


Oh look into her eyes, you see such silent stalling
And nothing seems to matter in this life
