[Intro]
[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on

[Verse 1]
In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your Soul
In black and white, they really, really ought to know
Those one-track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye, You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on

[Verse 2]
They gave you life, and in return you gave them Hell
As cold as ice, I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on

[Instrumental Bridge + Solo]

[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on

[Verse 3]
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind I'd really like to break your Heart
(I'd really like to break your Heart)

[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on

[Outro]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on - I'm talking to you
Come on ...
