Shame!
Dog shame!
I know what's wrong
Man's too old and wise
Bring in the dog
Turn on
Down to mountain rescue
Slip and slide when sunnny
Small cat better move along or this bitch could do some harm, baby!
Straight as an arrow, I'm walking the dog...
Walking the dog!
Three is a crowd
Two is a dog and me playing (what's he saying?)
Free as a cloud
No one ever really knew you
Make clear your illusion, no, no, no, no, no!
Some dreams you dream alone
You thank Christ you're coming home
You better better give the dog a bone!
Go go go go chew chew chew chew
Some dreams you dream alone
Go get a life and ease the pain
Dog's a best friend's dog!
Dog's a best friend's dog!
Words (words...words...words...)
Speech (speech...speech...speech...)
Blurred (blurred...blurred...blurred...)
Bleached (bleached...bleached...bleached...)
Tell Mr. God 't I'm walking the dog...
Walking the dog!
Some dreams you dream alone
You thank Christ you're coming home
You better better give the dog a bone!
Go go go go chew chew chew chew
Some dreams you dream alone
Go get a life and ease the pain
Dog's a best friend's dog!
Dog's a best friend's dog!
Dog's a best friend's dog!
Dog's a best friend's dog!
Dog's a best friend's dog!
