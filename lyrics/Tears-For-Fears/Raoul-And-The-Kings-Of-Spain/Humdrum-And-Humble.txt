Mistress of the mind
Take me where the air is clean
Ignorance is kind
Emerald and evergreen
Thirty days September
Year of miracle and grief
Through the haze remember
You're an animal
Not a mineral
And we won the war (lost the battle)
Lost the war (won the battle)
Won the war (lost the battle)
Lost the war...
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
Color for the color-blind
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
Through the human eye
Nature of a soul extreme
Nothing seems to die
Pictures in a magazine
Through the maze precisely
Through the myriad of schemes
With your gaze entice me
Like an animal
Not a mineral
And we won the war (lost the battle)
Lost the war (won the battle)
Won the war (lost the battle)
Lost the war...
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
Color for the color-blind
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
Through the maze precisely
Through the myriad of schemes
With your gaze entice me
Like an animal
Not a mineral
Won the war (lost the battle)
Lost the war (won the battle)
Won the war (lost the battle)
Lost the war...
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
Color for the colorblind
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
Rubbishing the Phillistines
All for the love of the humdrum and humble
