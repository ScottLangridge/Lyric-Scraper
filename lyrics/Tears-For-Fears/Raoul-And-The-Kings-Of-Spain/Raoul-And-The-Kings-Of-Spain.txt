When the seventh son of the seventh son
Comes along and breaks the chain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Making it plain, making it sane
To turn this loss into a gain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Did you know your father was an island
Did you know your mother was the sea
Can we ever hope to seek asylum
>From the bounds of fate and family
When the seventh son of the seventh son
Comes along and breaks the chain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Making it plain, making it sane
To turn this loss into a gain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Did you know all mothers come from heaven
Did you know all fathers come from hell
That is why they're at sixes and sevens
That is why they're marriage isn't well
(not well)
When the seventh son of the seventh son
Comes along and breaks the chain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Making it plain, making it sane
To turn this loss into a gain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
Raoul, Raoul, Raoul and the Kings of Spain
The Kings of Spain, The Kings of Spain
The Kings of Spain, The Kings of Spain
The Kings of Spain, The Kings of Spain
The Kings of Spain...
Raoul...
Song: Falling Down
Is this world spinning round
Has this ship run aground
What's that shape, what's that sound
That's just me falling down
Some of us are free, some are bound
Some will swim, some will drown
Some of us are saints, some are clowns
Just like me, they're falling down
Well I lied to the nation while my reputation ran dry
>From my lungs to my liver I clung to the river bank's side
Yeah well I'm back in the water, doing what I oughta
Trying to lead an ordinary life
Is this world spinning round
Has this ship run aground
What's that shape, what's that sound
That's just me falling down
Some of us are green, some are brown
Some are lost, some are found
Sight unseen, baby, sound on sound
Pray for me, I'm falling down
I was lost in the jungle, crossed over enemy lines
Well I got me a red nose by sleeping under hedgerows at night
Yeah well I tried levitaiton, flying in formation
Heaven knows the weight of this crime
Is this...
Is this world spinning round
Has this ship run aground
What's that shape, what's that sound
That's just me falling down
La la la, la-la la
La la la, la-la la
La la la, la-la la
La la la, la-la la
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down...
