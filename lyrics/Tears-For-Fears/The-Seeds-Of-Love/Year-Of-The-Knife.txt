Hallelujah, the king is dead. He said
" Love was the knife "
And now he'll dream some magic queen might try and save his life
They say his famous final words
He made his bed on love denied
Came from the heart of the man
He played Jeckyll and Hyde till the day he died

To lead a simple life
Too late for the young gun

Too late for the young gun
This is the year of the knife
See the mountains crumble
Summer will turn to winter

Feel the fire go cold

Love will turn to stone
They say his famous final words
I made his bed on love denied
Now I ain't gonna sleep tonight
Came from the heart of man

To lead a simple life
Too late for the young gun

Too late for the young gun
This is the year of the knife
