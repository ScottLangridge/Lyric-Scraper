A waking world of innocence
It ends with Swords and Knives
So grave those first born cries
When life begins with needles and pins

Oh dangerman, oh dangerman
Your blade fits like a glove
When forged in steel
That blood red bond of love

Time cannot heal
With the change in the way you look
In times of trouble you're an open book

And it's sad love's not enough to make things better
Like a dream, like it never happened
Turn the tables, we'll burn the fables
Fooled by now, we mystify the past
Lies beneath the visions and daydreams

God save those born to dieit ends with Swords and Knives
When life begins with needles and pins
