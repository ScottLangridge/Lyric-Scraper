Who is the man making the scene, flashing the green
Living it up in living it up to his name
Who wants some lovers gold, silver tone
Giving it up is his claim to fame

I'm a mystery man I'm doing what I can
With a continental international plan
So
Come on now, it's all now
This playa is here to stay now
Let me break it down, make you understand
Don't you know your history
I feel it, I mean it
This playa is here to stay
You're a woman I'm your man, it ain't no mystery

Who is the guy looking bad, I mean bad,
Making it up as he goes and he knows
That she'll come around turn up frown outside down
Breaking it up before he gets too old

I'm a mystery man I'm doing what I can
With a continental international plan
So
Come on now, it's all now
This playa is here to stay
Let me break you down, let me make you understand
Don't you know your history
I feel it, I mean it
This playa is here to stay
You're a woman I'm your man, it ain't no mystery

Bikinis, Cars, Cigars and Danger
Martini Hangovers, he ain't no stranger
To London, Paris, New York And Japan
I'm Bringing Home the Bacon in a Frying pan
L.A., Rio Or China Town
If you're down then I'm your mystery man
Doing what I can
With a continental international plan

So
Come on now, it's all now
This playa is here to stay
Let me break you down, let me make you understand
Don't you know your history
I feel it, I mean it
This playa is here to stay
You're a woman I'm your man, it ain't no mystery

(livin' it up)
(livin' it up)
(livin' it up)
