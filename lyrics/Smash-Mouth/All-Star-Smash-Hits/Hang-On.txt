Verse 1:
Things are gettin wierd things are gettin tough
Nothing makes sense but you keep looking up
They'll tell you 2 be true, they'll try it everyday
To keep it on real still you gotta find a way
So make ur mamma happy, to make ur pappa proud
You'll wanna turn it up and all you hear is turn it down

Bridge:
So gather round I'm here to say
You'll never make everybody's day
But while ur around you might as well, catch the tiger by it's tail

Chorus:
And hang on hang on hang on
Everybody just get on get on get on
Get started and go on go on
Everybody just hold on

Verse 2:
Sometimes I wanna cry and throw the towel in
They try to beat me downbut I'll take it on the chin
And everywhere I go the people all the same
And they just wanna know that everything will be ok
When things are gewtting rough You'll turn back around
You gotta turn turn when they'll tell you turn it down.

[Bridge:]

And hang on hang on hang on
Everybody just get on get on get on
Get started and go on go on go on
Everybody just hold on
Just hang on

[Bridge:]

Chorus 2x
