It's like I told you before, baby
And what more could I say that by now you should know
Three little words are thrown around so much
That after awhile they begin to lose their touch
And you would think that I'd come up with something better
Switch it up like I invented something clever
But I don't know where to begin
So maybe I'll just shut up
'cause I got nothing but a whole lotta love

CHORUS: Baby love
A whole lotta love
Baby love baby love
Could you be lovelier
A whole lotta love
Baby love baby love
Could you be lovelier
For you I'd take off my shoes and my socks, baby
And watch you laugh as I walked across burnin' rocks
But then I couldn't chase you everywhere you go
And it's all about the chase everybody knows
I'd like to think that you would never make me do this
But you know I'd do it if I had to prove it
I'd do it again and again
You know I'd dummy up
'cause I got nothin' but a whole lotta love

Could you be lovelier
Could I be luckier
So why was I so dumb
Maybe we're livin' on Mars
And Venus is too far
Now I got nothin' but nothin' to lose
Could you be lovelier I don't know
But I've seen a lot of things and nothing measures up
They say that beauty goes no deeper than the skin
I know a certain girl they've never ever seen
And when I see ya I just wanna get near ya
And I just wanna make it crystal clear
It's like I told you before
I got nothin' more for you
But a whole lotta love

CHORUS
