I get to the party, but I'm too late
And I got stood up on my very first date
I listen to country (What?)
And everybody goes rock
I get to the dance floor
That's when the music stops

It doesn't matter what I do
I just can't seem to win
But here I go again

[Chorus:]
And I say
Hey that's the story of my life
I had a good plan but it didn't go right
Oh no, I'm overdrawn
I check my account and the money's all gone
Why me? I don't know what to think
I finally get aboard and the whole boat sinks
Seems to be the story of my life

I pick a slot machine and lose it all again
But when I walk away, someone else always wins
She finally calls me, I forget my phone
And when I'm starving, you know the kitchen's closed

It doesn't matter what I try
It all ends the same
And here I go again

[Repeat Chorus]

Just when it seems like
It's turnin' 'round for me
There's always something
That ends up happening
I found my car
But I can't find my keys

I get to the party a little too late
And once again the music starts to play

Hey that's the story of my life
I had a good plan but it didn't go right
Oh no, I'm overdrawn
I check my account and the money's all gone
Why me? I don't know what to think
I finally get aboard and the whole boat sinks
Seems to be the story of my life

The story of my life
The story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
