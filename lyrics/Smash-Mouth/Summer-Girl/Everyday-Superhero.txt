Every morning I wake up just the same
I'm now the victim of ordinary things
I don't see myself as invincible
It's not... True you at all

I'm just your avrage ordinary evreyday superhero
Try to save the world
But never really sure
I'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero
Nothing more than that
It's all I really am

Just a day job that's someone's gotta do
It's kind of hard when everyone looks after you
Try to make it look easy gonna make it look good
Like anybody would

I'm just your average ordinary everyday superhero
Try to save the world
But never really sure
I'm just your avrage ordinary everyday superhero
Knocked in more then nuts
It's all I really am

I'm just like everybody else
After all the hype it's hard to tell
I keep my game face on so well

Cause' I'm just just your
Average

Superhero
I try to save the world
Cause' I'm just just your

I tried to hide my true identity
But no one knows it's only me

I'm just your average ordinary evreyday superhero
Try to save the world
But never really sure

Knocked in more then nuts
It's all I really am
