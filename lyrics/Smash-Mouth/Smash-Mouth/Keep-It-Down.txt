Back in the day everything seemed to be ok
But ok is just ok
And just alright makes you think
What could be on the other side
Runnin' with the big dogs
Left those puppies on the porch
Scratchin' fleas is the least in the real world
If I knew then what I know now
Just alright would be ok somehow
Shhhhh

Keep it down now
Could you keep it down

Had it made had it played itself out
In a sit-com style
So the landlord has his key in my door
I'll have amnesia for a while
I've seen ridiculous sunsets in a sickening sky
It made me feel really I'll in a beautiful way
I've seen perfect people and I shield my eyes
I don't deserve to see their shame
Shhhhh

Keep it down now
Just keep it down now
I can't hear myself think
Who needs to think

I know I know I know..........

Awesome electronica track
Shhhhh
