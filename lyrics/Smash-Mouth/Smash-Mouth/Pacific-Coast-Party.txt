Get your motor runnin'
California interstate 1
Pacific coast party
If you got to work today
Get yourself a new vocation
Pacific coast party
You don't have to mind father time mother nature
Get yourself in line take your time
And watch it slip away

Just quit your bitchin' bite your tongue
Save it for a rainy day, son
Pacific coast party
Get your ticket pack your bags
Come and join the celebration
Pacific coast party

If you wanna find peace of mind come and get it
Get yourself in line take your time
And watch it slip away
Pacific coast party

Chorus
Hey I heard somebody say work harder than you play
But I never missed a single day's party
Word I never heard a word I turned the other way
Pacific coast party

Instrumental (groovy)

You don't have to mind father time mother nature
Get yourself in line take your time
And watch it slip away

Chorus
Hey I heard somebody say work harder than you play
But I never missed a single day's party
Word I never heard a word I turned the other way whooooowooo
Pacific coast party
Hey I heard somebody say work harder than you play
But I never missed a single day's party
Word I never heard a word I turned the other way
Pacific coast party
Pacific coast party (pacific coast party)
Pacific coast party
