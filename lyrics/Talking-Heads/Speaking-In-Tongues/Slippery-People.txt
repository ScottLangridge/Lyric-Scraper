What about the time, you were fallin' over?
Fall on your face, you must be having fun
Walk lightly, think of a time
You'd best believe, this thing is real
Put away that gun, this part is simple
Try to recognize what is in you mind
God help us, help us loose our minds
These slippery people help us understand
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know (The lord won't mind)
No, no, no way (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
I remember when, sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug, the water was runnin' out
Cool down, stop acting crazy
They're gonna leave and we'll be on our own
Seven times five, they were living creatures
Watch 'em come to life right before your eyes
Backsliding, how do you do?
These slippery people gonna see you through
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know (The lord won't mind)
No, no, no way (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel

What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know (The lord won't mind)
No, no, no way (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know (The lord won't mind)
No, no, no way (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
He's alright, the lord won't mind
He's alright, love from the bottom to the top
He's alright, the lord won't mind
Right now, turn like a wheel inside a wheel
