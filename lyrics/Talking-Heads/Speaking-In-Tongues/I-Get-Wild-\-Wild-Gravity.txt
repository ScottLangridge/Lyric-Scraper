Fooled around enough with numbers
Let's not be ourselves today
Is it just my imagination
Is it just someone's fave
Pleasantly out of proportion
It's hard to hold on to the ground
Now I didn't come to run
And this is everything
And gravity lets you down

I get wild, wizing up
I just can't let go
I get wild  when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Living lights
Special lights
Yellow turns blue
I get wild  It's automatic
I can hardly move

Go ahead and pull the curtains
Check to see if I'm still here
Let me lose my perspective
Something worth waiting for
Somewhere in South Carolina
And gravity don't mean a thing
And all around the world
Each and ev'ryone
Playing with a heart of steel

I get up climbing out
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Beautiful
Beautiful
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic
No surprise at all

No one here can recognize you
Here is ev'rything that you like
Feelings without explanations
Somethings are hard to describe
The sound of a cigarette burning
A place there where ev'rything spins
And the sounds inside your mind
Is playing all the time
Playing with a heart of steel

I get wild, wizing up
I just can't let go
I get wild  when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Red 'n' white  black to gold
Yellow turns blue
I get wild  It's automatic
I can hardly move

I get up pushing up
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Shut the door
Shut the door
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic
No surprise at all
