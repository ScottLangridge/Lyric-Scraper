I, who took the money, who took the money away?
And I, it's always showtime here at the edge of the stage
And I, I, I, wake up and wonder
What was the place, what was the name?
We wanna wait but here we go again
I, takes over slowly but doesn't last very long
And I, no need to worry, ev'rything's under control
O. You. T but no hard feelings
What do you know?
Take you away
We're being taken for a ride again
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She has the smoke in her eyes
She's moving up, going right through my heart
She's gonna give me surprise
Better than this, know that it's right
I think you can if you like
I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair and nothing is better than that, is it?
Down, down in the basement we hear the sound of machines
And I, I'm driving in circles
Come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over?
Nothing was lost, everything's free
I don't care how impossible it seems
Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
Get closer to be far away
Only one look and that's all that it takes
Maybe that's all that we need
All that it takes, all that it takes, all that it takes, all it takes
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She goes wherever she likes
There she goes

I got a girlfriend that's better than that
Everyone's getting involved
As we get older and stop making sense
You won't find her waiting long
Stop making sense, stop making sense, stop making sense, making sense
I got a girlfriend that's better than that and nothing is better that this, is it?
