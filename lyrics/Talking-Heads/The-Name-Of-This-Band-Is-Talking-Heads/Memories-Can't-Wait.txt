Do you remember anyone here?
No you don't remember anything at all
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back
Never woke up, had no regrets

There's a party in my mind... And it never stops
There's a party up there all the time... They'll
Party till they drop
Other people can go home... Other peoplle they can split
I'll be here all the time... I can never quit

Take a walk through the land of shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Try not to look so disappointed
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?
There's a party in my mind... And I hope it never stops
I'm stuck here in this seat... I might not stand up

Other people can go home... Everyone else will split
I'll be here all the time... I can never quit

Everything is very quiet
Everyone has gone to sleep
I'm wide awake on memories
There memories can't wait.

Air... Air
Hit me in the face
I run faster
Faster into the air
(I say to myself)
What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too
Air can hurt you too
Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people never had experience with...

Air... Air
It can break your heart
So remember when the weather gets rough
(You'll say to yourself)
What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too
Air can hurt you too
Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people don't know shit about the...
Air...
