Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, drop me in the water, water
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the trouble that you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
I wanna know, can you'll tell me?
I love to stay
Take me to the river (Take me to the river), drop me in the water (Drop me in the water)
Dip me in the river (Take me to the river), drop me in the water (Drop me in the water, water)

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things that we could have had
Love is an ocean, I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know, can you'll tell me?
I love to stay
Take me to the river (Take me to the river), drop me in the water (Drop me in the water)
Dip in to the river (Take me to the river), push me in the water (Drop me in the water, water)
Hold me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
'Till I can, 'till I can, I can't tell
Come on and take me to the river (Take me to the river), drop me in the water (Drop me in the water)
Dip in to the river (Take me to the river), push me in the water (Drop me in the water, water)
(Get down Jerry, get down Jerry)
(Good to go, get ready)
(Are you ready Annabelle?)
(Come on lets go)
I don't know why I love you like I do
All the changes that you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And I commin' on the biggest fool of them all
I wanna know can you'll tell me
I love to stay
Take me to the river (Take me to the river), drop me in the water (Drop me in the water)
Dip me in the river (Take me to the river), drop me in the water (Drop me in the water, water)
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water, water
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water, water
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water, water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water, water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water
Take me in the river, drop me in the water, water
