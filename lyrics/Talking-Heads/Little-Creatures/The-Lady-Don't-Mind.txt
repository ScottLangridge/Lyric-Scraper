Last time she jumped out the window, well, she only turned and smiled
You might think she would say something but you'd have to wait a while
Well the lady don't mind, no, no, no, the lady don't mind
She just turns her head and disappears and I kinda like that style
Little boat, it floats on a river, it's drifting through a haze
She floats by whenever she wants to, well, there she goes again
Well, it's no trouble at all, no, no, no trouble at all
Well, what she does is all right with me and I kinda like that style
Come on, come on, I go up and down
I like this curious feeling
I know, I see, it's like make believe
Cover your ears so you can hear what I'm saying
I'm not lost but I don't know where I am
I got a question
All right, all right, this is what we like
Who knows, who knows what I'm thinking?

She says love is not what she's after but everyone knows
Each time she looks in the mirror, well, she lets her feelings show
Well, the lady don't mind, no, no, no, the lady don't mind
She just turns around and disappears and I kinda like that style
Uh-oh, uh-oh, here we go again
I don't know, I don't know what I'm sayin'
Hey man, hey man, I sure don't feel the same
She likes to say what she's feeling
Hey, did I get a big surprise, I know you think so
Come on, come on, she says anything
Who knows, who knows what she's thinking?
