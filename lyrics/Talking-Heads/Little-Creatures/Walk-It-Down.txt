I... I am just a number
I... Hang on to what I got
You... Say what you want to
I... I... I... I just try to stay alive
I... Put myself together
People say, get away, somebody will turn you in
Life, life without surrender
Togetherness... Ecstasy is what I need
I can laugh, but I should cry
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes

(and I said) walk it down. Talk it down.
(oh, oh, oh) sympathy. Luxury.
Somebody will take you there.
Walk it down. Talk it down.
(oh, oh, oh) sympathy. Luxury.
Somebody will take you there.

She... Says she remembers.
Time... Long time ago.
We... Belong together.
I... I... I... I turn up the radio
Lies, lies and propaganda
I... Gonna tell you what I need
Life, life, without surrender
Togetherness... Ecstasy is what I need
I got yours and you got mine
And I can swim, but I should fly

Chorus

Ain't no crime to believe
I took my money, I bet my life
What you see is what you get
But it sure ain't what we need.

Chorus
