I'm wearin' my fur pyjamas
I ride a hot potato
It's tickling my fancy, speak up, I can't hear you
Here on this mountaintop, I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell ya about some wild, wild life
Here comes the doctor in charge, she's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it, living wild, wild

I wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sittin' on a window sill but he spends time behind closed doors
Check out Mr. Businessman, he bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange, he got some wild, wild life
Break it up when he opens the door, he's doin' wild, wild life
I know that's the way you like it, living wild, wild
Peace of mind, it's a piece of cake
Thought control, you get on board anytime you like

Like sittin' on pins and needles, things fall apart, it's scientific
Sleeping on the interstate, getting wild, wild life
Checkin' in, a checkin' out, I got a wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time, done too much wild, wild life
We wanna go, where we go, where we go, I doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start, got some wild, wild life
Paint a picture of me in the daylight and it's a wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast, wild, wild
I know that's the way you like it, living wild, wild, wild, wild, life
