One two
One two three four

I was born in a house with the television always on
Guess I grew up too fast and I forgot my name
We're in cities at night and we got time on our hands
So leave the driving to us and it's the real thing
And you're rolling in the blender with me
And I can love you like a colour tv
Now love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, got love for sale
And now love is here, c'mon and try it
Got love for sale, got love for sale

You can put your lipstick all over my designer jeans
I'll be a video for you if you turn my dial
You can cash my check if you go down to the bank, down at the bank
You get two for one for a limited time, a limited time
Push my button, the toast pops up
Love and money, gettin' all mixed up
And now love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, got love for sale
And now love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, I got love for sale

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, I got love for sale
Love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, I got love for sale
And now love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, I got love for, I've got it for sale
And now love is here, c'mon and try it
I got love for sale, I got love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
