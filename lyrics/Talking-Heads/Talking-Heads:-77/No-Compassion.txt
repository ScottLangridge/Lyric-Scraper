In a world
Where people have problems
In this world
Where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems they overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time

So many people... Have their problems
I'm not interested... In their problems
I guess I've... Experienced some problems
But now I've... Made some decisions
Takes a lot of time to push away the nonsense
Take my compassion... Push it as far as it goes
My interest level's dropping, my interest level is dropping
I've heard all I want to, I don't want to hear any more

What are you, in love with your problems?
I think you take it... A little too far
It's... Not so cool to have so many problems
But don't expect me to explain your indecisions
Go... Talk to your analyst, isn't that what they're paid for
You walk, you talk... You still function like you used to
It's not a question... Of your personality or style
Be a little more selfish, it might do you some good

In a world where people have problems
In this world where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems, they overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time
(Here we go again)
