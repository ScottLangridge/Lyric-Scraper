Darling now, you made me change my mind
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh
Taller than the tallest sky
Sweeter than a grape on a vine, now
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, right now, now

So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

Oh, I don't have to worry no more
Oh my my my
Baby, somebody, somebody
What kind of life is this kind I'm trying living
I feel like I'm standing up and telling the word
Oh Lord, what kind of love is she trying to give me

I'm chained to your love
Don't break this little heart of mine
Darling, oh
There's no greater love than this love of yours and mine, oh
Darling don't ever pass me by
I ain't going no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh now

You walk with your head in the sky
So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
Lord, I don't have to worry no more
She got me chained to her love, now
I don't, I don't want to be taken away, baby
I'm chained, I'm chained and a little bound, now, now, now
Ou, just a little bit of soul
I don't, I don't know darling I wanna to be taken away, now
I'm chained, I'm chained to your love
Just a little bit of soul, now
