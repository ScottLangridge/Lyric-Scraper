They call me Mr. Pitiful
Baby that's my name now oh
They call me Mr. Pitiful that's how I got my fame 
But people just don't understand 
What makes a man feel so blue
They call me Mr Pitiful 'cause I lost someone just like you.

The call me Mr. Pitiful
This everybody know now
They call me Mr. Pitiful most every place I go. 
But nobody seems to understand now, 
How can a man sing such a sad song
Ooo when he lost everything, when he lost everything that he had.

How can I explain to you
When somebody had been so very blue
How can I tell you about my past 
If all things won't end. 

Mr Pitiful
That's my name now
They call me Mr. Pitiful, that's how I got my fame 
But nobody seems to understand now
Ooo what make a man feel so blue
They call me Mr. Pitiful 'cause I m in love with you

Can I explain to you
Everything is going wrong
I've lost everything I had 
I have to sing these sad songs
To get back to her 
And I want you 
And I want you
And I want you 
And I want you 
And I want to tell you everything is going through my mind
And I want to sing 
And I want to sing 
And I want to sing 
And I want to sing this song with you 
And I want to sing this song to everybody
'Cause I want them to understand what I talkin' about
I want you to understand what I'm sayin
