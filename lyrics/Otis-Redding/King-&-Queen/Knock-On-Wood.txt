I've been missing you for so many days
I keep wanting you [lord} in so many ways
I can't get you off of my mind
But true love is so hard to find
I want yet another day
Ooh I need another day
Darling, let me have another more day
And I can be anything that you want me to be, now
The sweet things you used to do to me
Sometimes you used to say them to me
I can't forget those lovely days
But this is the price I am about to pay
Ooh I want another day
You can let me have just one more day
Ooh I need one more day
And I will do anything that you want me to to
I will do anything that you want me to do, now
Say anything that you want me to say
Buy you anything you want me to buy
And I can cherish you till the day I die
If you let me have another day
Please let me have one more day
Ooh I want just one more day [lord}
And it can be anything that you want it to be
Ooh no,
Ooh
Just one more day now
You can let me have just another day, now
Please I want to stay And the day after and after
And I want all the days
And I want all the days
And I want you here by my side
And I don't want you do leave me
And You can let me have one more day
And I can love you long for the rest of my life I can cry, cry, cry
Please, Let me have just one more day
Just another day
Let me have all my days
Let me have Let me have all the days I gotta,
I Gotta I gotta have just all the days
