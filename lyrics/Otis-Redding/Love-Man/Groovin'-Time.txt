It's groovin' time-that's what my baby told me
If you can't groove me, boy, you might as well let me be
It's lovin' time-that's what my baby told me
If you can't love me, boy, you might as well let me be
Now, she said she don't want me hanging in the street
Don't want me going down seeing old Pete
Hanging out on Broadway is not her stick
Staying up late at night is not her kick
Wants me to tease her all the time
Wants me to love her later in the night
That's what she told me
If you can't do it, boy, you might as well let me be
Baby, it's groovin' time-that's what my baby told me
If you can't groove me, boy, you might as well let me be
Said she don't want me shootin' no pool
Running in the street, acting like a dog-gone fool
Said she just want me to stay at home
Just tend to my business-leave other people alone
Said she don't want me hanging in them nightclubs
All them Broadway funky, funky nightclubs
That's what she told me
If you can't do it, boy, you might as well let me be
It's groovin' time-that's what my baby told me
If you can't groove me, boy, you might as well let me be
