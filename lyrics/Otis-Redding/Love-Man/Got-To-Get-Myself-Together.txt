My baby wrote me a ten-page letter
She said I'll be coming home, boy, and I hope for the better
And you know that your mind it changes something like the weather
And I'll be coming home, boy, and I hope for the better
This is what she said
Dark clouds hanging over your head
Lightning and thunder
For every drop of rain that falls
I know you want to see your mama
I said, baby, I got to get myself together
'Cause you know my mind it changes something like the weather
And I'm going to be coming home, boy, and I hope for the better
This is what she said
It's raining and there is snow on the side
You got another woman by your side
You got to stop playing them tricks
You got to get that woman out there quick
Dark clouds hanging over your head
Lighting and thunder
For every drop of rain that falls
I know you want to see your mama
I said, baby, I got to get myself together
I said you know that my mind it changes something like the weather
This is what she said
I'll be coming home, boy, I hope for the better
This is what she said
I'm coming home...
