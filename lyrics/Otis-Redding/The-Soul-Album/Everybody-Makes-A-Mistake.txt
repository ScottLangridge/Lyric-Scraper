( Eddie Floyd & Al Isbell )

Out in the street
Playin' all night long
While the one that loved me
Man, she was sitting at home
Oh i didn't worry, i was a fool
Playing the field
And running around having fun, man
I know everybody make a mistake sometime

But when i got home
My baby, she was gone
And i found her letter lying
Right there on the kitchen floor
It read, "i tried to wait
For you to come, honey
But like a fool
You were running around doing me wrong"
I'm sorry, i know, baby
Everybody make a mistake sometime
I know i made one

And oh, so if you are running around
With somebody else
Tryin' to satisfy
Man, you can't satisfy you selfish self
So man, you gotta take heed
Listen to every word i'm saying

'Cause that same thing, man
Might happen to you one day
And you know that everybody
Man, i know that everybody
Make a mistake sometime
I know because i made mine
I made a great big one
Man, i made mine
I made a great big one
And i can't do it no more
No, i'm never gonna do it
I want you to come back to me, baby
