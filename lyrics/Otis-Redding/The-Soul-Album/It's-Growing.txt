( Robinson & Moore )

Like a snowball rolling down that side
Of that snow covered hill
Man, it's growing
Like that size of the fish
That man claimed he broke his reel
Man, it's growing
Like the rosebud that's bloomin', man
In the warning of the sun
It's growing
Like the tale by time it's been told
Man, by more than one
Ooh it's growing

But every day it grows a little more
Than it was the day before, yeah
My love for you, it grows anf grows
Hey, how it grows and grows
But where it's gonna stop
I feel that nobody knows, man
I said it grows and grows
Man, a little bit stronger
It grow and grows
A little bit more every day
It keeps on growing

Like the need of a guy to see his girl
When she's gone away
Man, it's growin'
Like the sadness in his heart
When he knows that she's gone to stay
Man, it's growing

I say every day it grows and grows
A little more than it was before
My love for you, it grows and grows
Hey, how it grows and grows
But how it's gonna stop
I feel, yeah
Now how it's going to stop
I feel that nobody knows, man
Nobody knows how it grows and grows
Nobody knows, man, it grows and grows...
