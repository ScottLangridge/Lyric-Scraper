( Sam Cooke, Lou Adler, Herb Alpert )

I don't know much about the history now
Don't know much about biology
Don't much about the science book
Don't know much about the french i took
All i do know is i love you now
And i wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be

I don't know much about geography now
Don't know much about
Trigonometry now
Don't know much about the algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But i do know one and one is two now
And i wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be

I don't claim to be "a" student
But that's what i'm trying to be
But by being an "a" student, baby
Looks like i could win your love for me

Don't know much about the history now
Don't know much about biology
I don't much about the science book now
Don't know much about the good french i took
All i do know is i love you now
And i wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be

I don't claim to be "a" student
But that's what i'm trying to be
But if i have to be an "a" student, baby
I'm gonna win your love for me

I don't know much about geography now
Don't know much about trigonometry
Don't know much about the algebra now
Don't know what a good slide rule is for
But i do know one and one is two now
And i wonder if you love me, too
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be

Good lord, i been trying
I been trying, i been trying...
