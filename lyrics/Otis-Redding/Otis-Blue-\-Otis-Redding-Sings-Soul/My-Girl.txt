They call me Mr. Pitiful
Baby that's my name now
They call me Mr. Pitiful that's how I got my fame
But people just don't seem to understand
How someone can feel so blue
They call me Mr pitiful cause I lost someone just like you.
The call me Mr. Pitiful
This everybody know now
They call me Mr. Pitiful Most everyplace I go.
But nobody seems to understand now,
How can a man sing such a sad song
When he lost everything that he had.
How can I explain to you
How somebody con get so very blue
How can I tell you about my past
If all things won't end.
