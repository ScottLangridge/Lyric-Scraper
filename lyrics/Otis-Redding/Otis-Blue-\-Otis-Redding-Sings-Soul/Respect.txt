What you want baby I got
What you need
You know I got it
All I'm askin' is for a little respect
When you come home
Baby when you come home
Respect
I'm out to give you all my money
But all I'm askin in return honey
Is to give me my proper respect
When you get home
Yeah, baby, when you get home
I ain't gonna do you wrong while you gone
I ain't gonna do you wrong
'Cause I don't wanna
All I'm askin' is for a little respect
When you come home
Baby, when you come home
Respect
Ooh, your kisses, sweeter than honey
But guess what, so here's my money
All I want you to do for me
Is give me some respect when you get home
Yeah, baby, when you get home
Are-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me
Are-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care, T-C-B
A little respect
