You left me, for another
You told me, he was your lover
And I'm down on any knee, ooh baby
So I'm begging and I'm pleading

Baby, ooh baby
That's What My Heart Needs
Ooh baby
I'm calling you out loud and clear, baby
That's What My Heart Needs
I love you, yes I do
And I want on meeting you, ooh baby
Darling, my my darling

If you hadn't left that day
That's what my heart needs
Then my love wouldn't be this way, ooh baby
I need you here right by my side, baby, darling

I said I need you right here by my side
I said I need you baby
Come on baby
I need you here to protect me and be my guide
And ooh, baby, yeah baby
I know you don't know what I mean, baby
Hey hey baby
Ooh, baby, yeah, hey baby
Come on, come on and be right by my side
Come on, come on and love me, baby, Lord
Hey, come on
