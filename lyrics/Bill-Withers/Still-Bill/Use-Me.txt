My friends feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me
But my answer to all that "use me" stuff is...
I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting used
Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up

My brother sit me right down and he talked to me
Well, he told me that I ought not let you just walk on me
And, I'm sure he meant well, yeah, but when our talk was through I said, brother...
If you only knew you'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up

Girl, sometimes, it's true you really do abuse me
Well, you get me in a crowd of high class people and then you act real rude to me
But oh baby, baby, baby, baby, when you love me I can't get enough
And, I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting used...
Oh, you just keep on using me until you use me up
Until you use me up

Talking 'bout you using me, well it all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're using me 'cause I sure am using you to do the things you do
Uh-huh, to do the things you do
