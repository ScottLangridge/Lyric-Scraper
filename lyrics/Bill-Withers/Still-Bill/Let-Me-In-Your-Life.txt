La, la, la
La, la

I only want to love you
Please dont push me away
Let me in your life

I wasnt even there when he hurt you
So why should I have to pay
Let me in your life

I want to share your tomorrows
So I must beg you today
If hes the cause of your sorrows
Be glad that hes gone away

I need someone, let me love you
Please dont push me away
Let me in your life

La, la, la
La, la
La, la, la
La, la
