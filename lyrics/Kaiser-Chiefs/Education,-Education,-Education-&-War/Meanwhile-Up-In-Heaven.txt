[Verse:]
Picture yourself by a rocket
Picture yourself in a glittering silver suit
Picture yourself getting on it
Saluting the news crews, you're the new recruit

[Verse:]
Do you remember the numbers
Hung on the door of the house where you grew up?
Do you remember the colours
Tied round the handles of last year's fa cup?

[Chorus: X2]
Meanwhile up in Heaven, they're waiting for you x2
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to

[Verse:]
Guided by love and a flash light
Led by consuming desire for a good idea
The light in the clock of the dashboard
Has not worked in years, but I know that it's still there

[Chorus: X2]
Meanwhile up in Heaven, they're waiting for you x2
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to

(Interlude x2)
Your mind is the key, is the key,
It is the key that sets you free
Oh your mind, is the key
It is the key that sets you free

[Chorus: X2]
Meanwhile up in Heaven, they're waiting for you x2
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to
