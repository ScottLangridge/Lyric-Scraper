I walk around in my house
Wonderin were on earth I am,
I'm in this room and I'm in that room
But in this room I live my life

My mums started workin' in that cafe in town,
She gets paid qite a lot in month
"but what do I get? I get 10s a month
So My mum can by anything,
But scince I only get 10 a month
I can only buy absolutly nothing for me

It puts me in a mood, so I stamp around the room

Cos when I

Walk around in my house
Wonderin where on earth I am,
I'm in this room and I'm in that room
But in this room I live my life

When I'm walkin around in my house
Wonderin where I am,
I'm in this room and I'm in that room
But in this room i... Live... My... Life

Unlike my friend danial I had a good day
And like my friend james my life is fine
Unfortunatly, my dads so like me
Only he gos to work and I go to school
So it came my mind on a very rainy
That maybe it would be good if we swopped places for the day.
I stayed in my room for the rest of the day an the I asked my dad
And can you guess what?

He put me in a mood, so I stamped around the room

Cos when I

Walk around in my house
Wonderin where on earth I am,
I'm in this room and I'm in that room
But in this room I live my life

When I'm walkin around in my house
Wonderin where I am,
I'm in this room and I'm in that room
But in this room i... Live... My... Life

When I'm walkin around in my house
Wonderin where I am,
I'm in this room and I'm in that room
But in this room i... Live... My... Life!!!
