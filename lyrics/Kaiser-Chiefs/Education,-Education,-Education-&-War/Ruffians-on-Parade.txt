I want it, I do it, I got it, believe it!
I see it on fire, to feel this is
I want in, I want out
Just wanted to feel this
The change of the season
Got something to believe in!

You know it feels like Heaven!
When I try, I can't find a reason!
So come on!

You feel sick, you've seen it
Escaping our dreaming
I want it, the pulse of the action, and listen!
I want in, I want out
Just want it to feel good
The change of the season
Got something to believe in!

You know it feels like Heaven!
When I try, I can't find a reason!
You know it feels like Heaven!
When I try, I can't find a reason!
Find a reason!
Find a reason!
Oh, I!

Don't want it, I do it
I got it, believe it!
