[Verse:]
I want it, I need it, I got it, believe it
I've seen it, on file, two feelings aspire
I want it, just run out, just wanted to feel good
The change of the season is something to believe in

[Chorus:]
You know it feels like heaven
All I try, I can't find a reason
To kill her [?]

[Verse:]
We're facing the scening, escaping the dream and
We're running, and pull yourself, the action you're missing
I want it, just run out, I wanted to feel good
The change of the season is something to believe in

[Chorus:]
You know it feels like heaven
All I try, I can't find a reason
You know it feels like heaven
(All I try, I can't find a reason)
Find a reason x3

[Outro:]
I want it, I need it, I got it, believe it
