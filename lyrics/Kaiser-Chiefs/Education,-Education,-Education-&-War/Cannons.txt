[Verse:]
Look alive
Pick a side
Draw a line in the sand
You're just the band

They treat us like we're extras in an epic
They treat us like we're mud on their boots
They leave us on the stretchers when the credits roll
Retreating safely to institutes
Where dinner party military forces
Toast themselves with the blood of us all
Smashing regimes between courses
Chanting education, education and war

(Bridge x2)
We're gonna need a lot more cannons (2x)
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas

[Chorus:]
I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there

[Verse:]
They're making all the difficult decisions,
Politicians and children first
Followed by their personal physicians who say
You will be happy if you expect the worst
Armed with paper straws and a Bible,
Lamps are going out across department stores
You will be issued with a rifle on arrival champs
For education, education and war

(Bridge x2)
We're gonna need a lot more cannons (2x)
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas

[Chorus:]
I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there

[Interlude:]
Oh, oh, oh
Show us the way to go
Hell or heaven help us
Show us the way to go
Save our souls
Show us the way back home
Save our souls
Show us the way to go

Quick time
Get in line
Get behind
The man in front
You're the grunts

Look alive
Pick a side
Draw a line in the sand
You're just the band

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
