Roll the dice,
Keep 'em guessing, asking questions
One more time!
Close the vice,
Keep 'em pressing, teach 'em a lesson
Hold the line!

Pre-chorus:
Don't run through the door
Open any doors, I promise,
Acting silly, I haven't broken any laws,
We're not the bad ones!

Chorus:
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody taken to the streets
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody was... To the breech.

Cold as ice,
Heavy heels, different shield
Broken line!
Shoulders, I see a Medea spin the wheel
One more time!

Pre-chorus:
Don't run through the door
Open any doors, I promise,
Acting silly, I haven't broken any laws,
We're not the bad ones!

Chorus:
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody taken to the streets
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody was... To the breech.
Where every song was like one more last song
Every song is like one more last song
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
One more last song!

Pre-chorus:
Don't run through the door
Open any doors, I promise,
Acting silly, I haven't broken any laws,
We're not the bad ones!

Chorus:
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody taken to the streets
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody was... To the breech.
Where every song was like one more last song
Every song is like one more last song
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody taken to the streets
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
Everybody was... To the breech.
Where every song was like one more last song
Every song is like one more last song
Not anymore alone, ay, ay
One more last song!
One more last song!
One more last song!
One more last song!
