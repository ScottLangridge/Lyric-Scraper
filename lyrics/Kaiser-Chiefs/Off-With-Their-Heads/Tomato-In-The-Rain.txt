Like a tomato in the rain
I got that feeling again
Like a greyhound in a race
I've got a rabbit to chase
Roll under me no ones going down
You got the remedy, what's going around?

Like a beetle on it's back
I've got to get back on track
Or a police man on a tape
Waiting down in the lane
If the wheel comes off your car
Hammer it and nail it or 2
Before it falls apart
Add more nails and glue

Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?

I got that feeling again

I got that feeling again

Roll around with me, no ones going down
You got our memories it all comes back around

Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?
Yes I do know about you
Shall I come home?
