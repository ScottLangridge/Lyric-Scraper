In nights of old, they lie in the roads.
Off with their heads, and always lead opinion polls.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.

In uniforms, of green and gold,
Like crocodiles they march in files of unison.

Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with the ringside seats.
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free.

I like it too much, I like it too much.
I like it too much, I like it too much.

Coz you are, descended from animals, and you are constructed of chemicals. The one thing you can't have, you lie too much.

You look but you cannot touch.

Like dominoes, one only goes. They all fall, sail the ship, rock the boat.

I like it too much I like it too much.
I like you it much I like it too much.

Coz you are, descended from animals, and you are constructed of chemicals. The one thing you can't have, you lie too much.

You look but you cannot touch. I like it all too much.

Ooo...
