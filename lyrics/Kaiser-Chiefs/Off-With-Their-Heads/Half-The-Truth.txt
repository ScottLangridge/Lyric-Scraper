Girl and boy
Everythin' in full swing
Heads or tails
Doesn't make a difference

Beneath the glamour
There was always gonna be
Amateur dramatics
A lot of bad behavior

I would see (I is said like ah?)
Glasses on the table
One, two, three
Only you and me

Wearing nothin'
In the lap of luxury
Sip it slowly
Not a leg to stand on

Take my money
Twist our paper

Leave the table
Bad behaviour

I got my spies
Swift to every consultlate
Be my eyes
Tell me what I never see

Cos a ghost
Don't fear a lover
Nothin' teath blank ah
Get ready for the credit clubber

Secret moore
Gettin' it together
With a big fat bowl
Of alphabet spaghetti

Watch the birdie
Lookin' through the mirror
Polly wanna cracker
That's not what I heard

I will not lie to you
But I defiantly only gave you half the truth
I wil not lie to you ooo ooo

I will not lie to you
But I defiantly only gave you half the truth
I wil not lie to you ooo ooo

Ahhh
Ahhhh

Gentlemen
Turn off your recorders
I can hear them buzzin'
From inside of you're tracksuits

Got to get
To California
Where this woman is
Threatening to sue me

Get right back
Back to the beginning
Where we start off single
And everythin' in full swing

Everyone
Around you wearing big gold hatscome on
Playin the piano now

Rapping

Listen... I wont lie
So baby don't cry
The way I'm feeling right now
I'm feeling so high
I can't tell you the truth
Baby you know why
Cause everybody talks about me
I'm a known guy
I'll tell you half the truth
At least I told you half
For all the rest of it
I'll tell you if you only ask
Cause I'm a gold digga
And I should know better
