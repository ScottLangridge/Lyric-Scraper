Nothing I say's so important
That it can't be shortened to fit on a badge
I wish that I could be contrite
And deliver her sound bites, but here is the catch

Everybody applauds her
From the lord to the hoards and a nation is swept
By her one to one conversations
In adult education I would tell her except

Can't say you're unattractive
But I'm out of practice at this sort of thing
It's not like I'm talking Italian
Or I wear a medallion and a sovereign ring

Great things can be expressed
In fifteen words or less and pinned onto your heart
Words just don't do it justice
The world and it's crust is still drifting apart

Can't say what I mean

Do you know when you go I get all tongue-tied
I'm the same all again back when you arrive

What a face
What a face
Can you blame me for pulling a face?
What a waste
What a face
