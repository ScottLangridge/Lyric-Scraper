How could we not notice it before
Well you may as well have pinned it to my door
Well we are so slowly coming around to the fact
That this friend is a friend no more

And if you think you are right then you are wrong
No one ever really knew what's going on
Now we are all so slowly coming around
And this friend of a friend was no friend all along

The penny drops with the top of tory fell
To the cruel and bastard Taj Mahal
A penny more to the floor of Sacre Coeur
From the Spanish men to the Yorkshire moors
