Yesterday you lay awake on your bed,
And worked out you'd done everything that you said,
That you knew therefore you'd got to be saved,
The lord of the bored and a slave to her... (wage?)

It's a mystery
Oh, it's a mystery
You want some history
Oh it's a mystery

So last night you got up and out of this room,
The ceiling is peeling and covered in gloom,
Jaguar shoes is the best you deserve
Decision, a lesson you ought not to learn.

It's a mystery
Oh, it's a mystery
You want history
Oh it's a mystery

Today as you shake off the drunken degree,
All that is left is the faint memory,
The downing, the drugs, all the nights on the tiles,
It's hard to remember but totally worthwhile.

It's a mystery
Oh, it's a mystery
You want some history
Oh it's a mystery

It's a waste of money
You have to admit
And it's a waste of money
You have to have it?

It's a waste of freedom
You have to resist
If you're wanting history
You've got it

It's a waste of money
You have to admit
And it's a waste of money
You have to have it?

It's a waste of freedom
You have to resist
If you're wanting history
You've missed it

Don't stop moving
You mustn't stop moving
You can't stop moving
You must join in

Don't stop moving
You mustn't stop moving
You can't stop moving
You must join in

Oh oh oh-oh-oh oh oh oh bit
