We went to the youth club and we, looked out of place
I didn't know where to look so I, looked at your face
But you were a boxing champ and, I was a weakling
You didn't give me a chance, you gave me a beating
And I thank you very much that you did

And as the time went by we, stayed out of trouble
Before I could realise, my age had doubled
The man I became is a tragic bore
And he's not a boxing champ anymore
If there's one thing I learnt it's to run away
At least I enjoy what I do today
And I thank you very much that I do
