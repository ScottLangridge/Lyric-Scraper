I can just imagine you and me
Running out of steam
Going through the motions
I have no idea how you know
When I dip my toes
In other people's oceans

You had a local knowledge
Of the local area
And that impressed me quite
So I tried that night
To do all the things I thought you'd like
But that just made it worse
And I impressed you not
Well not a lot

So we started from the start...

When the heat dies down
I'll be back in town
And until that time
I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down
I'll be back in town
And until that time
I'll be round at mine

When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down...

I can not imagine growing old
To have and to hold
Til death do part each other
Cause I doubt I can stomach 20 years
Spending time at hers
Talking to her mother

I've got wider knowledge of the world
I just can't face another argument about the rent,
It all seems unimportant
In the grander scheme of things
Cause I was purpose built
To not feel guilt

So we ended at the end...

When the heat dies down,
I'll be back in town,
And until that time,
I'll be round at mine
When the heat dies down,
I'll be back in town,
But until that time,
I'll be round at mine

When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down,
When the heat dies down...
