(Da da daaa, da da daaa)

(Da da daaa, da da daaa)

Let it never be said, the romance is dead
Cos there's so little else occupying my head
There is nothing I need except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed, doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa

Due to lack of interest tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset and the pendulums held
Cos there's nothing at all except the space in between
Finding out what you're called and repeating your name

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa, aaaa

Could it be, could it be that you're joking with me
And you don't really see you with me
Could it be, could it be that you're joking with me
And you don't really see you with me

[Instrumental]

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa (Da da da, da da da)
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Ahaa-ahaa-ahaa, aaaa
