Suddenly there's a knock at your head
Don't let them in because they're trying to take your tv set
Ha-ha-ha-happiness is a bowl in your hand
You've got to try and blow this party trip as far as you cann
Cre-cre-cre-creosote is pouring out of my brain
And... Crick in your neck
Get a room, get a head, get a hat
We'll come and do the... Where the trouble is at
Come to the city on a Saturday night
Watching the boys on their motorbikes
I wanna be like those guys
I wanna wear my clothes tight
Matching jackets and a fistful of notes
New sneakers and a fresh pack of smokes
Ne-ne-ne-nuerofenmax is a word and a mum
They're just trying to put the punk back into punctured lung
Pe-pe-pe-panic over party off party on
We are birds of a feather and you can be the fat one
Come to the city on a Saturday night
Open your heads like a satellite
I wanna see what they see
I wanna love you like crazy
Count your... Out of your face
Can see into your room from outer space
Come to the city on a Saturday night
It's not the size of the nine until five
I wanna know what that does
I wanna show what matters
Cause it's the size of the fire and man
That makes the difference to the size of the sham
Cut through the city on a Saturday night
Cause you and me are we're on the edge of the night
Come to the city on a Saturday night
I asked your mother and she said it's alright
We're getting married when we're thirty
Gonna do it on your birthday
Cause I don't wanna waste a moment with you
I just wanna live the whole night through
Cut through the city on a Saturday night
Cause you and me are we're on the edge of the night
