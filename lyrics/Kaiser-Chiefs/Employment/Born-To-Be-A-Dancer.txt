You and me we're made
It's impossible to say to me
Together always
Then you moved away
To the capital of England
I hope you stay there
Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know the real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh oh
I came down at your
On the national express
Request to touch your breasts
And there I found that you
You were hanging with crowd
Hello, of cheats and liars
Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know the real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh oh
Once you asked me what I'm thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know the real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know the real answer?
I was born to be a dancer
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
