Time on your side that will never end
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your nametag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic
It don't matter to me
'Cos all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist
It don't matter to me
'Cos all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
Oh my god, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Great ruins make for greater glorys
The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down I'll get right back up again
I come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man
It don't matter to me
'Cos all I wanted to be
Is a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar
Oh my god, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Oh my god, I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And Oh my, god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
Hoo-oome
