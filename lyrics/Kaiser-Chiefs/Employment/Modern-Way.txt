I know 'cos I've seen it
It was great and I want it
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on my own
Do you know what
I was put here in this world for
Could you tell me
In three words or more
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here
Take a lesson
>From the ones who have been there
My brain is not damaged
But in need of some repair
Hold on to the basics
But we can change all our tactics
There's no point in sitting
Going crazy on your own
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here
This is the modern way
Of faking it everyday
And taking it as we come
And we're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
This is the modern way
I know where I'm going
And that we are in the knowing
And I will stop at nothing
Just to get what I want
It's the only way of getting out of here
It's the only way of getting out of here
This is the modern way
Of faking it everyday
And taking it as we come
And we're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
This is the modern way
This is the modern way
Of faking it everyday
And taking it as we come
And we're not the only ones
Is that what we used to say
This is the modern way
