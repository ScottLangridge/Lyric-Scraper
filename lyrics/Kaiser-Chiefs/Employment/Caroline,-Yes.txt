You've done well my boy, my oh my
I bet you thought that you had one this time
Watch your back because revenge is sweet
And you are everything I wanna be
You got everything so high oh high
Did you have to take Caroline?
I bet you thought that was the death of me
Cause you are everything I wanna be
In my life
In my life
You got your way now and I got mine
But mine is better and it took less time
People say now that you look like me
Cause you are everything I wanna be
In my life
In my life
Aaaah...
Cause you are everything I wanna be
In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life
