Head down, keep your head down
Keep your rent down over time
Hold tight, to your red stripe
Why do we fight everytime
I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way

Nightclub, Marlboro Light stub
Stuck to my gob all the time
I treat you like you're see-through
I don't mean to everytime

I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way

What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of disdain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth

Disgrace, back to my place
I'm a complete waste of your time
I'm asleep before the first sheep
Until the last bleep of all time

I wish that you could see me in the day
I hope that you'll remember me that way

What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of distain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth

What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was pain
And a look of distain
What did I ever give you
When you wanted me to
All I gave you was grief
Are you sick to your teeth

What did I ever give you (echo)...
