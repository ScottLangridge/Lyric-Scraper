Katherine, kiss me
Slip your little lips
Will split me
Split me away
Your eye won't hit me
Yes, I love you, I mean it
I'd love to get to know you

Sometimes I say
The stupid things I think
I mean I
Sometimes I think
The stupidest things
Mmmmmm
And do you ever wonder
How the boy feels

Katherine, kiss me
Flick your cigarette,
Then kiss me
Flick your eyes at mine
So briefly
Your leather jacket lies
In sticky pools
Of Cider Blackberry
You glance and ricochet
From every alpha male
Behind me
Eyeslike bubbles
On the washing machine

Mmmmm
I wonder
How the boy feels

Katherine, kiss me
In the alleyway
By Jacket
In the sodium light
Yes
I love you, I mean I
Need to love

And though
Your opened eyes
Stay bored
Upon
The overflowing pipes
Above me
Tonight
I don't mind
Because I never wonder
How the girl feels
