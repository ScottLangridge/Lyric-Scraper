I woke with Wings
From lucid dreams
Knew the reason I felt hollow
Was that I no longer cared
If there was some great truth or not

I'm going to take my aimless love,
My angry heart and my desire
I'll Build a Nation of You
A New Utopia For You To Live in

I gazed into my crystal palm
Blinking black beneath the twilight
Knew that I no longer cared
If this was my last day or not

I'm going to take my aimless love
