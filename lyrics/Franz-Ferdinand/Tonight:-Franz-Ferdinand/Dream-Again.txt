Don't be afraid if you hear voices
Or feel the sweet air
Spoken upon you
Sometimes the sound
Of a thoughsand
Whispering words
Of hope will reassure
Show me the future
Will see us join again
Oceans split
Or the mountains sigh
Then I
Will keep on dreaming

I live to dream again (x4)

Don't be afraid if you're descending
The deepest despairs
Without a handrail to guide you
Sometimes the sound
Of a thousand
Whispering words
Can confuse
But when you're sleeping
They shift and slide together
Bring meaning
To the Canyon's Cry
So I
I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again (x4)

Sometimes the sound
Of a thousand
Whispering words
You live a little fear
But fear the future

I feel us dream together
I feel no fear
I feel no fire
Oh I
I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again (x4)
