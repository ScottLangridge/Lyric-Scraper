When youre happy from a dream
Is it hard to work out whats real
Is the real over there
More vivid than here ever feels
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While youre looking for somebody to love

[Chorus:]
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh other side
But inside love, you will be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Got covered, reason term(?)
But itll bring you up
You'll be alright

Its a Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home
Well, you want to be loved
But nobody else seems to know
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While youre looking for somebody to love

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While youre looking for somebody to love
Were all looking for somebody
Were all looking for somebody to love

[Chorus:]
