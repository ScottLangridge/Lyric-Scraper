How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am
The proudest man
Ever born

I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun's this low
Everything's cold
On the line of the horizon

Come to me
Oh won't you come to me

How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am
The cruellest man
Ever born

I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun is this low
Everything's gold
On the line of the horizon

In South Shields Metro station
I heard Marsden Rock was breaking
The North Sea shaking
All that we know
To make us see the point of living
Is to live
So you won't come to me

The North Sea sings
'Won't you come to me baby? '
The North Sea singing
'Won't you come to me? '
