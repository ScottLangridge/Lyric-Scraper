I come home, practically all is nearly forgiven
Right thoughts, right plans, right action
Almost everything could be forgotten
Right thoughts, right plans, right action

How can we leave you to a Saturday night
On a Sunday morning, good morning

But sometimes, wish you were here, weather permitting
Right thoughts, right plans, right action
This time, same as before, Ill love you forever
Right thoughts, right plans, right action

How can we leave you to a Saturday night
On a Sunday morning, good morning

Sometimes, wish you were here, weather permitting
Right thoughts, right plans, right action
Right thoughts, right plans, right action
Right thoughts, right plans, right action
Right thoughts, right &#7767; lans, right action
Right now
