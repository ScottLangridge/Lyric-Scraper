It seems this boy bathed in ridicule
Too forward, way too physical
It's time that I had another
I'm always wanting more, if there's another one
Give me some more, I'll have another one
I'll have a slice of your mother

This boy's so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)

I see losers losing everywhere
If I lose I'll only lose the care
That I might have for another
I am complete, invincible
If I have one principle
Then it's to stand at you, brother

This boy's so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)

I wanna...

I want a car,
I want a car (yeah)
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)

If I like cocaine, I'm racing you
For organic fresh Echinacea
One kick's as good as another
If I'm tired, I'm tired of telling you
I'm never tired, I'm always better than you
Bye boy, run to your mother

This boy's so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
Oh Yes I am spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)
I want a car
I want a car (aha)
I want a car
I want a car (yeah)
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want.
