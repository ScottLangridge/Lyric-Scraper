I'll try to make the sunshine
Brighter for you
Now we're leaving beautiful
There's a tear in your eyes

After all is said
After all is done
I'll do anything for you
Come with me
Close your eyes
Hold my hands and feel alright
Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Lift your head
It's gonna be alright

I'll try to make the star shine
Brighter for you
And I'll take you in the shoulder
Holding you way up high
I even chase the rainbow
Handed it in the sky

After all is said
After all is done
I'll do anything for you
Come with me
Close your eyes
Hold my hands
It'll be alright
Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Lift your head
It's gonna be alright

Through the eyes of innocence
You will find
You will see
They'll come in time all make sense
And you won't know
That it will show inside
Deep inside

Come with me
Close your eyes
Hold my hands
It'll be alright
Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Lift your head
It's gonna be alright

I'll try to make the days last longer for you
From the daybreak to the sunset to the end of time
I'll keep you safe away from the hurting

Cause when all is said
When all is done
I'll do anything for you
Come with me
Close your eyes
Hold my hands
It'll be alright
Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Lift your head
It's gonna be alright

Come with me
Close your eyes
Hold my hands
It'll be alright
Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Lift your head
It's gonna be alright
