All of my life, I've been searching
For the words to say how I feel.
I'd spend my time thinking too much
And leave too little to say what I mean
I've tried to understand the best I can
All of my life.

All of my life, I've been saying sorry
For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems I'm always that little too late
All of my life

Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay
Set 'em up, cos I'm going nowhere
There's too much I need to remember, too much I need to say

All of my life, I've been looking
But it's hard to find the way
Reaching past the goal in front of me
While what's important just slips away
It doesn't come back but I'll be looking
All of my life

Set 'em up...

All of my life, there have been regrets
That I didn't do all I could
Making records upstairs, while he watched tv
I didn't spend the time I should
It's a memory I will live with
All of my life
