You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I, Now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
I guess you were right
I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again

Now I, Now I know, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Yes girl I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes I wish it would rain on me

Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside
And I know, it's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign

Cause I know, I know, I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again

Now I, Now I know, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ohh I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ohh I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes I wish it would rain down, rain down over me

Just rain down over me
Just let it rain down...
