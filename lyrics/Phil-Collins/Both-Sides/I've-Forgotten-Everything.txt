I've forgotten everything about you
'til someone says your name
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you
'til someone tells me that you rang

The memories are hazy now
I don't recall at all
There's nothing, there's nothing there
Just me
And I don't understand why

I can't recollect my feelings
'til someone mentions that they saw you
I really don't remember all the things you said
'til someone shows me where you live

Why is everything so hazy now
I don't recall at all
There's nothing, there's nothing there
Just me
And I don't understand why

I can't recall your smile
The touch of your hand holding mine
And I can't remember why
Holding you seemed so right

The memories they're hazy now
I don't recall at all
There's nothing, there's nothing there
Just me
And I don't understand why

I've forgotten everything about you
'til someone says your name
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you
'til someone tells me that you rang
