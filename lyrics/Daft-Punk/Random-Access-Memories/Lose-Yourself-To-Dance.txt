[Verse:]
I know you dont get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isnt stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Hook:]
Lose yourself to dance

[Verse 2:]
I know you dont get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isnt stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
Everybody dancing on the floor
Cant do any more anymore
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on

[Verse 3:]
I know you dont get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isnt stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
