Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sun light into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had it my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turn in all our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
And everywhere I go
These moments still shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
And everywhere I go
These moments still shine

Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had it my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turn in all our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
And everywhere I go
These moments still shine

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
And everywhere I go
These moments still shine
