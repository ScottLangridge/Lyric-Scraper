Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing and will
Feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing and be
Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing and we'll be
Feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight
(X6)

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing and will
Feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing and be
Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing and we'll be
Feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
(X6)

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right
(X6)
