Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie,
I don't need a reason why
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring,
I ain' missin' not a single thin
And cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out I'm gonna do you in
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

Top coat, top hat,
I don't worry cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves,
Lookin' sharp and lookin' for love
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
