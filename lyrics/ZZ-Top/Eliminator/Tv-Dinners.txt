Tv dinners there's nothin' else to eat
Tv dinners they really can't be beat
I like 'em frozen but you understand
I throw 'em in and wave 'em and I'm a brand new man oh yeah!

Tv dinners they're goin' to my head
Tv dinners my skin is turnin' red
Twenty year old turkey in a thirty year old tin
I can't wait until tomorrow.... And thaw one out again oh yeah!

Tv dinners I'm feelin' kinda rough
Tv dinners this one's kinda tough
I like the enchiladas and the teriaki too
I even like the chicken if.... The sauce is not too blue.

And they're mine, all mine, oh yeah
And they sure are fine.
Gotta have 'em
Gimme somethin' now.

- Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank Beard
