Whoa!
Yeah!
Yeeaaaaah!

Draggin' old Mustang ' 69
Top dropped back and lookin' fine
Workin' the groove backin' up with Scotch
Lookin' like Sir Lancelot

What it is Brother
What it is kid
Rock it like a mother
What it is!

Lookin' to sway by the evenin' shade
But I'm not ready to behave.
That ain't bad on the other hand
Detroit rocks lke the Rio Grande

What it is Brother
What it is kid
Rock it like a mother
What it is

What it is
What it is
What it is
What it is
What it is what it is
