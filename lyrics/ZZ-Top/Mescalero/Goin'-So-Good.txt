Just when I have enough money to spend
And I was always thinking it would never end
Then the time came to the end of the game
Don't you know

And just when the sky got shiny and bright
There never seemed to be an end to the light
Then the clouds came, it started to rain
Don't you know

Just when it was goin'
Just when it was goin' so good
Just when it
Just when it was goin' so good

Just when the highway straightened out for a mile
And I was thinkin' I'd just cruise for a while
A fork in the road brought a new episode
Don't you know

Just when it
Just when it was goin' so good
Just when it was goin'
Just when it was goin' so good

Baby don't you worry
I said baby don't you cry
We're gonna get it together
And I know you're askin' why

Just when it
Just when it was goin' so good
Just when it was goin'
Just when it was goin' so good

Yeah

Just when baby.........
