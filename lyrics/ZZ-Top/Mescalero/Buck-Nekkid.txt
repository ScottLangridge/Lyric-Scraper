Two shots shy of a 40 ounce quart
A hand in the pocket and a hand in the shorts
Shoot me with two and don't be slow
Only got one good way to go

Get naked
Buck naked
Buck naked
It's the only way to go

Twenty six chicks, all tied in a knot
Ain't all good, but it's what we got

Get naked
Buck naked
Let me see you naked
It's the only way to go

Buck buck

I was feelin' so fine
And things were lookin' better
My baby said maybe
And I said I'd let her

Get naked
Buck naked
Let's get naked
It's the only way to go

Get naked
Everybody get naked
Buck naked
It's the onliest way to go

Get naked
Get buck naked, yeah
