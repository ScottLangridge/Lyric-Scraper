Get your brakes and get your beats
Keep something in your pocket knock you off your feet
Rollin tight rollin slow roll it right
I know you wanna go
Get dusted
Dusted

Get your baby and grab your freak
Get your boots, you gotta hit the street
Take insurance in the shade of green
Take a back street where you won't been seen
And get dusted
With a dustball
Dusted

Get a big mother fucker on the line
Take a sweet sip like a fine wine
Roll it tight roll it slow roll it right
I know you're gonna wanna go
Get dusted
Get dusted
Get dusted
Get dusted
