(Gibbons, Hill, Beard) 3: 42

Mister Ten Dollar Man with that gold in your hand,
Comin' 'round here after sunlight
With your peaches and your Pream
And your rollin' magazine,
Tellin' me you'll make me feel alright.
Now, you'll make me feel alright

Mister Ten Dollar Man with a girl by the hand,
Will this ten-spot take her away?
With his slaver's finance
He winked; Said, "Take a chance."
Don't you know, it happens ev'ry day.
I said it happens ev'ry day.

Mister Ten Dollar Man with that gun in your hand,
Can I get a case of those tonight?
And now you've got the order;
I said it's time to slip the border
Don't you know it happens every day
I said it happens every day
