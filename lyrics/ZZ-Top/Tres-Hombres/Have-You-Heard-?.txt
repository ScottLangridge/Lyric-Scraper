Have you heard 'bout Jo Ti Mahr,
Yeah yeah yeah?
Well, then you could not be lost,
Yeah yeah yeah.

Which way are you comin' from,
Goin' up or gettin' down?
Well, have you thought about it some
Or have you put it down?

Have you heard about heaven,
Yeah yeah yeah?
Seven come eleven,
Yeah yeah yeah.

Have you heard, dear brother,
Yeah yeah yeah?
Well, let's help one another,
Yeah yeah yeah.

Have you heard, oh yeh?
Have you heard, oh yeh?
Have you heard, oh yeh?
Have you heard, oh yeh?
Have you heard, oh yeh?
Have you heard, oh yeh?
Have you heard, oh yeh?
