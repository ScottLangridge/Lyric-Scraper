Get high, everybody, get high.
Get high, everybody, get high.
Get high, everybody, get high.
Get high, everybody, get high.
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird.

All you kids from Texas,
You grow so big and tall.
All of them kids from Texas
They grow so big and tall.
All of them like to roam
In that T-Bird hall.

Get hi-hi-high.
Really makes you feel so fine,
Really goes down so smooth,
Really puts you in the groove.
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird.

Juice, juice, juice
Really makes you loose loose, loose,
Really goes down so smooth,
Really puts you in the groove.
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird.

Get hi-hi-high,
Way up in the sky.
Gonna get, yes sirree,
If ya come and rock with me.
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird.

- Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank Beard
