Well she likes the truck
I guess I'm in luck
She wears high heel cowboy boots
She'll slam a shot
Whatever you got
She walks the line makes no excuse

Fly high
I'm never satisfied
Fly high
I'm takin' one last ride
Fly high
I'm bone dry and I'm waiting to die
Fly high
Don't you know its hard to signify

She likes to smoke
And she likes to toke
Axe her no questions and she won't have to lie
She likes to charge
Long as it's large
Make no mistake she got the evil eye

Fly high
I'm never satisfied
Fly high
I'm takin' one last ride
Fly high
I'm bone dry and I'm waiting to die
Fly high
Don't know you its hard to signify

Fly high
I'm never satisfied
Fly high
I'm takin' one last ride
Fly high
Jimi said I'm gonna kiss the sky
Fly high
You bad bad bad remission why
