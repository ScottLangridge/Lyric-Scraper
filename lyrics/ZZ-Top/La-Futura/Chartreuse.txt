Chartreuse
Chartreuse
You got the color that turns me loose
Chartreuse
That color just turns me loose
Better than Magenta
Better than Fuse
You got a shade that gets rid of the blues.

Chartreuse
Don't you knew I like big Caboose
Chartreuse
You know I like that big Caboose
It's sure sweet,
Lights my fuse
It's sure sweet,
Lights my fuse

(Guitar Solo)

Chartreuse
That color just turns me loose
Chartreuse
You got the color that turns me loose

You got the blues baby
I got the juice
You got the blues baby
I got the juice

(Outro Solo)
