He/she wanna be
Body and soul just don't agree
There's an answer, gotta go for a
Tijuana tuck-n-roll

He/she just got a zipper job
A zipper job

It ain't nothin', it ain't no thing
It's just changin' face of yin and yang
Ain't no callin' for alarm
It's just a different kind of charm

It's alright, on one condition
Certainly before transition
No one even need a clue
Just pull the old switch-a-roo

He/she done got a brand-new glistening zipper job
Oh yes, a zipper job

Flip, strip, zip, trip a talon-42

Timing is everything
For kings, queens, and in-betweens
It's a question of what to do
'Cos what is what and who is who?

He/she just got a zipper job
An everlasting zipper job
