I dropped out of society

Fell by the wayside so to speak

Quit my job I'm A lazy slob

Never lift A finger 'cept for my heart throb

I'm A sinpusher, hangin' on the on the "DL"Own low

Just A sinpusher, kinda like heaven or hell

I want A bit of everything

I'm wanted by the law

I just want A little bit

I guess I want it all

I'm A sinpusher, hangin' on the on the "DL"Own low

I just A sinpusher, kinda like heaven or hell

I like my big fat back

I like my ya ya thin

I like to push it down

Into the land of sin

I'm A sinpusher, hangin' on the on the "DL"Own low

I A sinpusher, kinda like heaven or hell
