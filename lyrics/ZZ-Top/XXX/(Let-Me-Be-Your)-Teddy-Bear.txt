California

Baby let me be

Your lovin? Teddy bear

Put A chain around my neck

And lead me anywhere

Oh let me be

Your teddy bear

Baby let me be

Around you every night

Run your fingers through my hair

And cuddle me real tight

Oh let me be

Your teddy bear

I don't want to be A tiger

Cause tigers play to rough

I don't want to be A lion

Ause lions ain't the kind

You love enough

I don't want to be A tiger

Cause tigers play to rough

I don't want to be A rhino

Cause rhino's horn to gruff

I don't want to be A cheetah

Cause cheetahs scratch your stuff

I don't want be A lion

Cause lion's ain't the kind

You love enough

Oh now baby let me be

Around your cage tonight

Wrap your lock around my key

And turn it round just right

Oh let me be

Your teddy bear

Oh let me be

Hay hi ho teddy bear

Oh teddy bear
