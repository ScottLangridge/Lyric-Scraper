Call me A pretty boy

They call me A saint

They call me A sinner

It's gonna be the same

Now I'm not afraid

And I'm not afear

I ain't gonna lose it

And I'm not scare

To do the fearless boogie

To do the fearless boogie

Smokin' fearless boogie

Until it gone

They call me A pontiac

The red in my neck

They call me A cadillac

They call me A wreck

Now I'm not afraid

And I'm not scare

Now I ain't gonna lose it

No, I'm not afear

And do the fearless boogie

To do the fearless boogie

Smokin? Fearless boogie

Until it gone

(third verse not given)

They call me A lover

They call me A fool

They call me A winner

They call me A mule

Do the fearless boogie

Do the fearless boogie

Smokin? Fearless boogie

Until it gone, gone, gone

(Ad lib)
