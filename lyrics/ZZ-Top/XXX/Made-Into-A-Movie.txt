Who would believe

After such A long time

I found her again

And that's not just another line

A last minute scene then another

If you hit your mark

I gotta tell ya brother

It should be made into A movie

But who would believe it

Should be made into A movie

Oh you just have to see it

I gotta' confess

I lost A measure of faith

But she held the power

Followed me place to place

First A rival, then A lover

If you can shoot it

I gotta tell ya? Brother

It should be made into A movie

But who would believe it

Should be made into A movie

Oh you just got to see it

It should be made into A movie

Who in their right mind

Would spend hard earned money to see it

It should be made into A movie

What A scene, what A scene

It should be made into A movie

Who would believe

It should be made into A movie

I guess you just have to see it.
