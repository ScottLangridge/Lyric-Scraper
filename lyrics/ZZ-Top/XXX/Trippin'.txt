I GOT A FAVORITE PLACE

IN A FAVORITE TOWN

IN A FAVORITE FOREIGN COUNTRY

I BEEN HANGIN' AROUND

IT AINT TOO BIG

AND IT AIN'T TO FAR

AND WE COULD GO

CRAZY WITH OUR HEAD IN A JAR

AND GO TRIPPIN'

IN A SECRET SPOT

WE COULD SECRETLY FREAK

IF YOU GIMME A SHOT

AND SECRETLY MEET TOMORROW

IF I TELL WHAT TIME

TELL ME WHAT HO NAME

AND WHAT CHO?SIGN

LET'S GO TRIPPIN'

TRIPPIN' AWAY

YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HALF

YOU CAN TAKE MINE

ITS TOTALLY SHINE OR TOTALLY BLIND

BUT ONE OR THE OTHER GONNA' WORK OUT FINE

WE GO TRIPPIN'

TRIPPIN?AWAY

WE GO TRIPPIN'

WE GO TRIPPIN'
