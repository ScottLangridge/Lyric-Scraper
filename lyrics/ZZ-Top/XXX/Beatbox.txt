A nine volt battery from japan

It's got the beat

A little tape deck in my hand

It's so so sweet

Keeps me rockin' Ound the clock

I don't mind it

I got the beatbox, the beatbox,

Just A beatin' that box

Beatbox, beatbox

One C-90 back to back

Jumpin? On that jack

Don play with fire or

Unplug my wire, beg or steal

It not for hire

Keeps me rockin' Ound the clock

I don't mind it because

I got the beatbox, the beatbox

Just A beatin? That box

Beatbox, beatbox
