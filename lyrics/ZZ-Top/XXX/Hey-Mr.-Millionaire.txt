(Recorded live w/Jeff Beck on vocals)
I WENT DOWN ACROSS THAT BORDERLINE

DOWN IN THE PLANET MEXICO

BOUGHT SOME TEQUILA

BIG SACK O?WHACK

I LET GO OF TH?PESO I COULDN'T GET BACK

HEY MR. MILLIONAIRE, HEY MR. MILLION

CAN YOU LOAN THIS PO?BOY A DIME?

I WALKED DOWN ACROSS THE BORDERLINE

WAY OVER PLANET LONDON

BOUGHT A ROLLS ROYCE AN?A JAGUAR

IT'S DOESN'T NOT MATTER HOW RICH YOU ARE

HEY MR. MILLIONIARE, HEY MR. MILLION

CAN YOU LOAN THIS PO?BOY A DIME?

I MOVED ON ACROSS THAT BORDERLINE

DEEP OFF TH?PLANET LOUISIANA

THREW SOME DICE

IT WAS OH SO NICE

BUT IT LEFT ME EATIN' RED BEANS AND RICE

HEY MR. MILLIONAIRE, HEY MR. MILLION

COULD YOU LOAN THIS PO?BOY A DIME?

HEY MR. MILLIONAIRE, HEY MR. MILLION

LOAN THIS PO?BOY A DIME

LOAN THIS PO?BOY A DIME

TURN YOURSELF INTO A BANKER
