I'm picking up on a signal
That's in the air tonight.
It's sparkin' my receiver,
It feels like dynamite.
I got the message
But I wanna get it straight from you.

My mind is electric,
I'm about to blow a fuse.
The cockpit is empty
So shoot it down the tube.
I got the message
But I wanna get it straight from you.

I've got to make a connection.
I'm on needles and pins.
Workin' up a printout
And I'm gonna zero in.
I got the message
But I wanna get it straight from you.

- Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank Beard
