I went down to dock number ten
To see what just came in.
They seemed a little bit mysterious,
I think I'm gonna get delirious.
Delirious delirious

I got nailed in a raid last night,
They tried to haul me off to jail.
Things were looking kind of serious
Till everybody got delirious.
Delirious delirious

I fell into a hand of cards
And almost blew the night away.
Things were looking kind of furious
Till everybody got delirious.
Delirious delirious

I overloaded and I saw the light,
Decadence was on my mind.
Everything was getting ridiculous
Till everybody get delirious.
Delirious delirious

- Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill & Frank Beard
