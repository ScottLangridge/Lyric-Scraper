I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl;
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world.
Before we go crazy, before we explode,
There's something bout me, baby, you got to know, you got to know.

I get off on 57 chevys;
I get off on screaming guitar.
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me.
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart.

Feels like were falling into the arms of the night,
So if you're not ready, don't be holdin me so tight.
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain;
Heres what you're gettin and I don't want to change, I don't want to change.

Chorus

I don't need to glitter, no hollywood,
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good.

Chorus
