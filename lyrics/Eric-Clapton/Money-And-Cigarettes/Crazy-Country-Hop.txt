Way down in a country town one day
A little ole' country band began to play.
They had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone;
When the leader said go them cats began to blow.

[Chorus:]
Ooh wee oh oh,
Ooh la la, let's rock and roll.

Now all the poeple gathered 'round
Just to dig that rockin' rollin' sound.
Suddenly the drummer rang a bell
And all them country cats began to yell.

[Chorus]

Ole' MacDonald did a crazy bop
Said it's time to milk my cow, I got to stop,
But just before I cool it and cut out
Here's something all you cats can think about.

[Chorus]

Snaggle-toothed Malinda was a drag,
She latched onto a dude who showed up stag.
He tried to run and then he tripped and fell;
She kissed him and we all could hear him yell.

[Chorus]

Well, a hound dog ran a polecat into town,
Brought him to the dance and laid him down.
Someone hollered skunk and you can bet
All them country cats is runnin' yet.

[Chorus]
