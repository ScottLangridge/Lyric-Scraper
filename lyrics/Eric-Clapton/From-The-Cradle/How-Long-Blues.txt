How long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?
How long, how how long, baby how long?

Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once had had.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I could see the green grass growing on the hill
