I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.

I went to the river to jump in.
My baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when."

Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.

I love you babe with all my heart and soul
