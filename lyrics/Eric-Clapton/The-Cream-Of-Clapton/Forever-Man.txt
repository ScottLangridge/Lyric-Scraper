(by jerry lynn williams)

How many times must I tell you babe,
How many bridges I've got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss,
Fore I can talk to the boss?

How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Wont you be my forever woman?
Ill try to be your forever man,
Try to be your forever man.

Second verse

Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Try to be your forever man.

Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Forever man, forever man, forever man.
Try to be your forever man.
