I don't care if you never come home,
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea,
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me.

You cause a commotion when you come to town
Put on a smile and you melt
And lover's and friends are all good and fine
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine

La la la...

I don't care what you do with your night
Oh I don't care how you get your delight
I'll just leave you alone
I'll just let it be
I don't love you and you don't love me

[Chorus:]
I got a problem
Can you relate
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow
We'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end

La la la...
I tried to love you for years upon years
Refused to take me for real
It's time you saw what I want you to see
That I'd still love you if you'd just love me

Chorus

La la la...
