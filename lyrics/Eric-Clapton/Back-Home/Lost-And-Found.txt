Falling in the deep end
Stop messin' around
I can't keep from falling
When you're not around

I can't no rest when you leave
Your love keeps me burnin'
You got me lost and found
And my world keeps turnin'

It's not the same when you're gone
Feel like I'm half of myself
'Cause I need to have you around

I need to hear that sound
Of you creepin' in the morning
I need to look in your eyes
When it keeps me learnin'

It's not the same when you're gone
Feel like I'm half of myself
'Cause I can't keep my feet on the ground
You keep my lost and found
And girl it feels good

So I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around

It's not the same when you're gone
Feel like I'm half of myself
It's not the same when you're gone
Feel like I'm half of a man
But I can't keep my feet on the ground
You got me lost and found
And girl it feels good

So I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around

Can't keep my feet on the ground
You got me lost and found
And girl it feels good

So I want you to know
I'm ready to let it show
That I'll be around
