Go do it,
Got to go through that door,
There's no easy was out at all...
Still it only takes time
'Til love comes to everyone.

For you who it always seems blue
It all comes, it never rains
But it pours,
Still it only takes time...
'Til love comes to everyone.

There in your heart...
Something that's never changing
