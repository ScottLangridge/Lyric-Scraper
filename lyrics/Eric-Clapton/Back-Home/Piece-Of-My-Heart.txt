My Life was always draggin on
You showed me how to be in love
I Realize when you were gone
And I love everything about you baby

Cuz your the vision in my mind
Your spirit is so sweet and strong
You help me up when I'm broken down

And I love everything about you baby
Never let our love fall away

Cuz this is heaven when your close to me
Oh, it flows like a river

Cuz this is heaven when your close to me
And I'll give a piece
A piece of my heart

Cuz you're the star in all my dreams
You keep me goin on and on
No one knows what you do for me

And I love everything about you baby
Never let our love fall away

Cuz this is heaven when your close to me
Oh, it flows like a river

Cuz this is heaven when your close to me
And I'll give a piece
A piece of my heart

(don't let go)
(I'm livin for ya baby)

Never let your love fall away

And I love everything about you baby

This is heaven when your close to me
Oh, it flows like a river

And I'll give a piece of my heart
