I've been on the road too long
Moving in the wrong direction
I don't know where I belong
I don't know what I will do
If I can't get back home

Troubles I've got on my rope
They don't fit no other person
Memories keep rollin' on
I don't know what I will do
If I can't get back home

I don't fit but I don't give a damn
I won't quit 'cause I know who I am
And I admit and I've been on the left

Bit by bit, I'll review my plan
This is it, do the best I can
Trust and understand

'Cause I know that I am loved
'Cause I'll be on my way
Got no need to stay 'round here

'Cause I been on this road too long
Going in the wrong direction
And I don't know where I come from
All I know is I will die
If I don't get back home
