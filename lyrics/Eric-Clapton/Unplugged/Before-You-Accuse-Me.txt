(by eugene mcdaniel)

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
Youve been taking money from someone else

I called your mama bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama bout three or four nights ago
Well your mother said son
Don't call my daughter no more

First verse

Come back home baby, try my love one more time
Come back home baby, try my love one more time
If I don't go on and quit you
I'm gonna lose my mind

First verse
