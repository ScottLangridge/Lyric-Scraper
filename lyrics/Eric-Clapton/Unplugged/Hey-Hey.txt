(by big bill broonzy)

Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey.
Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey.
I love you baby,
Sure aint gonna be your dog.

Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey.
Hey hey. Hey hey, baby, hey.
My arms around you baby,
All I can say is hey.

First verse

Hey hey. You lost your good thing now.
Hey hey. You lost your good thing now.
You had me fooled,
I found it out somehow.
