So you think you are something special;
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could admit, you are something special.
Wont you tell me, girl? I'd love to know.

Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends.
I can tell they really think you're fine.
And I've seen you with your other men friends.
They don't know if you're a love of mine.

It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.

Chorus

Cause youve taken away
The only thing I've ever ever had.
Don't you know that I loved you?
Whyd you make me feel bad?
The only thing I ever loved
Was loving you.

First verse

Chorus

What makes you think you are something special?
