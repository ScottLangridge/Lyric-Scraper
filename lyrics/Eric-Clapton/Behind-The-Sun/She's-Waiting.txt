(Eric Clapton and Peter Robinson)

[Chorus:]
She's waiting for another love.
She's waiting for another love.

She's been waiting for another love,
Someone that she can show into her heart.
And when she finally finds a stronger love,
Your whole world's gonna fall apart.

[Chorus:]

You've been abusing her for far too long
