You use me to get you anything you wanted.
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby,
And your other friend can get you what you want now.
If I go through those same things again,
I'll be worse off than I started.

Girl, you're such a bad influence
And you've got ways to make me do what you want.
Girl, you're such a bad influence
