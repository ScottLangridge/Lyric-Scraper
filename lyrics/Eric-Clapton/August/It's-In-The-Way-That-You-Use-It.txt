By eric clapton and peter robertson

Its in the way that you use it,
It comes and it goes.
Its in the way that you use it,
Boy don't you know.

And if you lie you will lose it,
Feelings will show.
So don't you ever abuse it,
Don't let it go.

Nobodys right till somebodys wrong.
Nobodys weak till somebodys strong.
No one gets lucky till luck comes along.
Nobodys lonely till somebodys gone.

Chorus

First verse

I've seen dark skies, never like this.
Walked on some thin ice, never like this.
I've told you white lies, never like this.
Looked into true eyes, never like this.
