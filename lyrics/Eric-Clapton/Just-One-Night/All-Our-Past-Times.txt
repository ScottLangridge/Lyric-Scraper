I don't want to be the one to say I'm sorry.
I don't want to be the one to take the blame.
I don't want to be the one to throw it over.
I don't want to be the one to feel ashamed.

I don't want to be the one who thinks of nothing.
I don't want to be the one to tell you what you have seen.
After all this time, well I thought that you were mine.
I just want to be the one who would share this dream.

All our past times should be forgotten.
All our past times should be erased.
I don't care how much it costs
