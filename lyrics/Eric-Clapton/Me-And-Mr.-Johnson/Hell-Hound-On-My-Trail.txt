I got to keep movin'
I got to keep movin'
Blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail
Umm mmm mmm mmm
Blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail
And the days keeps on worryin' me
There's a hellhound on my trail
Hell hound on my trail
Hell hound on my trail

If today was Christmas Eve
If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
Aow, wouldn't we have a time, baby?

All I would need my little sweet rider just
To pass the time away, huh huh
To pass the time away

You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm
Mmm, around my door
All around my door
You sprinkled hot foot powder
All around your daddy's door, hmm hmm hmm
It keep me with ramblin' mind, rider
Every old place I go
Every old place I go

I can tell the wind is risin'
The leaves tremblin' on the tree
Tremblin' on the tree
I can tell the wind is risin'
Leaves tremblin' on the tree
Hmm hmm hmm mmm
All I need's my little sweet woman
And to keep my company, hey hey hey hey
My company
