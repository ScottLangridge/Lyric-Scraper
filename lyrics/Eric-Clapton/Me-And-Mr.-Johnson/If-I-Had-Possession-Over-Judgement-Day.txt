(Robert Johnson)

If I had possession over judgment day,
If I had possession over judgment day,
Lord, the women I'm lovin' would have no right to pray.

And I went to the mountain, far as my eye could see.
Lord, I went to the mountain, far as my eye could see.
Some other man got my woman and the lonesome blues got me.

And I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long.
Lord, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long.
And I woke up this morning, my biscuit rollin' on.

Had to fold my arms and slowly walked away.
(I didn't like the way she done.)
Lord, I fold my arms and I slowly walked away.
Well, I said in my mind, "Your trouble gonna come some day."

Well, now run here baby, get down on bended knee.
Lord, now run here baby, get down on bended knee.
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me.
