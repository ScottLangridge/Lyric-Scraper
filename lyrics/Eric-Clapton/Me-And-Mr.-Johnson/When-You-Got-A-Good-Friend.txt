(Robert Johnson)

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side [2x]
Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right

I mistreated my baby, but I can't see no reason why [2x]
Anytime I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry

Wonder, could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me
Mmm, or would she sympathize with me
She's a brownskin woman, just as sweet as a girlfriend can be

Mmm, baby I may be right or wrong
Baby, it your opinion, I may be right or wrong
Watch your close friend, baby, then you enemies can't do you no harm

When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side [2x]
Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right
