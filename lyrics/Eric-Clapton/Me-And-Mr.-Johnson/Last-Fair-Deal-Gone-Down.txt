Please, Ida Belle, don't cry this time

If you cry about a nickel, you'll die 'bout a dime
She wouldn't cry, but the money won't2 mine

I love the way you do
I love the way you do, good Lord,
On this Gulfport Island Road1

My captain's so mean on me,
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me, good Lord,
On this Gulfport Island Road

Take camp tain he and see, camp ain't he and see
At scal ain't be at seen3, good Lord,
On that Gulfport Island Road

Ah, this last fair deal goin' down,
It's the last fair deal goin' down
This' the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord,
On this Gulfport Island Road1

I'm workin' my way back home,
I'm working my way back home
I'm workin' my way back home, good Lord,
On this Gulfport Island Road

And that thing don't keep-a ringin' so soon
That thing don't keep-a ringin' so soon
And that thing don't keep-a ringin' so soon,
Good Lord, on that Gulfed-and-Port Island Road
