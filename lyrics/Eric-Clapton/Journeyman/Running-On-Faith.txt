(by jerry lynn williams)

Lately I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you

Lately I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way

I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
Id find a love who cares just for me

Then wed go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you

Chorus

Then wed go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
When love comes over you
