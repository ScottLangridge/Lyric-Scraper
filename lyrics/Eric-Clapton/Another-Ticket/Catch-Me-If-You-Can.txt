By eric clapton and gary brooker

Catch me if you can; I wont be easy to find.
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind.
Catch me if you can; it wont be easy to do.
And Im warning you brother I wont be leaving no clues.

Catch me if you can; I wont be leaving no scent.
Ive been running the wrong way, I think it's time that I went.
Believe me, Im a man; I aint easy to tend.
And Im moving on out, so catch me if you can.

There's no use bothering with the lost and found.
Youd better find a shovel, cause Ive gone to ground.
Little girl never did pay me no mind.
I guess I'll have to go and leave her behind. so . . .
