You've been told
So maybe it's time that you learned
You've been sold
Maybe it's time that you earned

I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I won't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart

I'll explain, I feel like I'm being used
Make it plain, so you don't get confused

I can't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
Fooling around with my heart

I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're playing around with my heart

It's time, time for me to let you know
Ain't no crime, no crime
To let your feelings show

I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're playing around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're playing around, I can't stand it
Fooling around, I can't stand
Running around, I can't stand it

Running around, I won't stand it
Running around, I won't stand it
You're fooling around, I won't stand it
Playing around, I won't stand it

You're funning around with my heart
You're fooling around with
My heart, my heart
Running around with
Fooling around with my heart

Fooling around, I won't stand it
Running around, I won't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
Fooling around, I won't stand it
Running around, I can't stand it
Fooling around, I can't stand it
Running around, I can't

Running around with
Running around with
Running around with...
