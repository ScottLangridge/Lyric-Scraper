By eric clapton

Why can't it stay like this forever?
Why does it always have to change?

Everytime you think youve paid the price,
Seems youve always got to pay it twice.
Everytime you think you're near the end,
You turn around and find another ticket.

Oh my love, time is running out.
Oh my love, time is running out.

Why must we wait until tomorrow,
When we already know the score?

Everytime you think youve paid the price,
Seems youve always got to pay it twice.
Everytime you think youve got it made,
Seems you're only lying in the shade.

Everytime you think youve run the course,
Seems youve got to ride another horse.
Everytime you think you're near the end,
You turn around and find another ticket.
