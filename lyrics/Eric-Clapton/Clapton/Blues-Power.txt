(by eric clapton and leon russell)

Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock n roll.
Oh, I got the boogie-woogie right down in my very soul.
There aint no need for me to be a wallflower,
Cause now Im living on blues power.

I knew all the time but now Im gonna let you know:
Im gonna keep on rocking, no matter if it's fast or slow.
Aint gonna stop until the twenty-fifth hour,
Cause now Im living on blues power.

First verse

Talking to you, now.
The boogies gonna pull me through.
Keep on, keep on, keep on keeping on.
Keep on keeping on, keep on keeping on.
