By J. J. Cale

After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.
After midnight, were gonna chug-a-lug and shout.
Were gonna stimulate some action;
Were gonna get some satisfaction.
Were gonna find out what it is all about.
After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.

After midnight, were gonna shake your tambourine.
After midnight, it's all gonna be peaches and cream.
Were gonna cause talk and suspicion;
Were gonna give an exhibition.
Were gonna find out what it is all about.
After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.

After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.

Second verse

After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.
After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.
After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.
After midnight, were gonna let it all hang down.
