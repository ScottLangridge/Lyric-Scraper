You don't need no high I.Q.
To get right down and sing the blues.
If you're down, here's what to do;
Me and my guitar will sing for you.

[Chorus]
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.

I got a box and an old whisk broom.
We gonna rock around the room.
When my guitar plays this tune,
We gonna dance to the light of the moon.

[Chorus]

What you feel, that ain't no jive.
The get down sound makes you feel alive.

[Chorus]

Push it, little Rachel, push it.
Push it, little Rachel, push it.

Pull it, little Rachel, pull it.
Pull it, little Rachel, pull it.
