Last night as I stepped into the stage lights,
I heard the people cry when they saw my face.
There's nothing like our hearts beating in time.
The crowd may inspire, but you give me my strength.

Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for your sweet smile.
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I need to hold you for a while.

I've been slipping into desperation
