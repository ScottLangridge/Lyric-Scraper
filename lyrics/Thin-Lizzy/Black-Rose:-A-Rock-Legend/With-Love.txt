It's a tedious existence laying your love on the line
Resistance is useless she can leave at any time
I must confess that in my quest I felt depressed and restless
But this casanova's roving days are over more or less

With love

She broke my heart and made me sad
You foolish boy you lost what you had

My mademoiselle I must make my farewell
You see senor I know she don't want me no more
I'd like to make that fraulein mine, mein fraulein
So I'll depart sweetheart and leave you with this line

With love
She says she won't be back no more
With love
She says she's leaving for sure

My mademoiselle I'll say farewell
No matter where you are, au revoir
'til we meet again, auf wiedersehn

She wrote it on a letter
But it didn't make him feel any better
With love
She says goodbye, adios, farewell

There are those who will spend a lifetime of leisure
'til the leisure finally takes control
And they'll spend their life in search of pleasure
Never knowing the treasure that they own

There are those who will spend a lifetime in hard labour
'til the labour breaks both body and soul
And they will learn to love their neighbor
And be assured of what they own
