In the land of eireann
Sat the high king
Faced with the problems
The dreaded vikings

Gather all the men folk
Speaking the celtic tongue
The land is eireann
The land is young

Stands red o'donnell
Fighting the saxon foe
With hugh o'neil
Oh

All along the north land
They fight bitterly
The land is eireann
The land is free
