Up till now I used to pass my time
Drinking beer so slowly, sometimes wine
No god, air, water or sunshine
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and I used it

Up till now my youthful stage
A useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and I used it

I never, I never, I never

Up till now my love life
A few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam
And honesty was my only excuse
I took my life in my own hands and I abused it

Up till now I used to tap dance
Take a girl by the hand saying I need your , I need your romance
Oh I had so many chances
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and abused it

Up till now the path of life was fair enough
Enough was fair, all was right
And now I know, I see the light
And honesty was my only excuse
