In the dismal darkness
I have sat and gazed, amazed
At the blazing factories

Like the lonely man
Who stands on the seashore
And I am afraid

As weary as I am
I try
I seem to see that things look ok

Run, run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Many lovely ladies
I have felt, touched
And I was not afraid

I took them out dancing
Out romancing
And I was not afriad

Then somewhere from the north
This gale I knew just flew in
And I am afraid

Run, run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Run, run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Run, you got to run in your skin
Look what the wind just blew in

Look what the wind just blew in
You got to look what the wind just blew in
You got to look what the wind just blew in
