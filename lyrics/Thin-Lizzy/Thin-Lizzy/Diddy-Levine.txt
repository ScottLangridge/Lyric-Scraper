In the later forties
When diddy levine lived with eunice king
He gave her the ring that she wore

Janice the smiling daughter
Who came from a marriage way before
But eunice was the father that she always saw

Though they never never never never told her
She always knew the score
You see kids were so much wiser after the wars

But diddy hadn't have enough
She had to get some more
On a ration piece of paper, she wrote "eunice, I'm not sure"

And with her child in her arms
She went looking for a fling
Besides, she didn't like the name mrs. King

The first time that she heard damper dan
Was on the radio
Crooning at a volume that was way, way down low

Diddy was surprised to hear that damper's name was dan
Soon after he was a calling
And he asked, begged and pleaded for her hand

Damper's heart was dampened
When diddy answered "no, no, no, no, no"
But if she changed her mind, she said "dan, I'll let you know"

With her child in her arms
She went looking for man
Besides, she didn't like the name damper dan

Janice the smiling daughter grew up to be a teenage queen
Through all of her mother's lovers
She kept the name levine

Behind the picture house she first made her scene
With a boy called allister
Who was dating a friend called celine

And celine wasn't mad when janice came in between
But allister got scared when he heard
And he joined the usa marines

Inheritance, you see, runs through every family
Who is to say what is to be is any better
Over and over it goes, goodness and badness winds blow

Over and over, over and over
Over and over and over and over and over and over and over
The good and the bad winds blow
