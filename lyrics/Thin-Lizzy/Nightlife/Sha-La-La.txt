A strange kind of magic
Call it voodoo
You want the woman
Yes you do

Believe me baby
I know it's true
Come on sugar
Let me give it to you

I want to sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh right

Black magic woman
You've got a hole
Come on sugar
I'll lose control

I want your body
Not your soul
Come on baby
Take my jelly roll

Hey honey
Want some money
Go find it
I do
