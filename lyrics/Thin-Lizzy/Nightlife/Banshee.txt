Instrumental. the lyrics printed below are from one of the poetry books
Of philip lynott and is entitled, "banshee".

I was your lover
You were my queen
You broke my heart
I gave up everything

I was your friend
But you were my foe
I told you that
I could not let you go

At night I hear the wind calling
"oh come back my darling"
Oh banshee! oh banshee!
It keeps on calling me, keeps on calling me

We dance the night away
Oh we dance the night away

I won your heart
You took my soul
I love you then
But you left me cold

I was your lover
You were my queen
You broke my heart
I gave up everything

At night I can hear you calling
"oh come back my darling"
Oh banshee!oh banshee!
I hear you calling me, I hear you calling me
