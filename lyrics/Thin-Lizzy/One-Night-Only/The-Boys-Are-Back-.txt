Guess who just got back today?
Those wild Eyed bvoys that've been away
Haven't changed, Haven't much to say
But man I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was where you could be found
Told 'em you were livin' downtown
Driving all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town

You know that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night she be on the floor shakin' what She got
Man I tell ya she was cool she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know forget her

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
I said the boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's Bar & Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you'd better let 'em

The Jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song
The nights are gettin' warmer it wont be long
Wont be long till summer till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
(spread the word around)

The boys are back in town, the boys are back in town
(The boys are back, The boys are back)

The boys are back in town again
Been hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again
