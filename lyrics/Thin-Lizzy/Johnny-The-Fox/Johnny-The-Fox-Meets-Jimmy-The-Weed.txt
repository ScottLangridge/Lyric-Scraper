Johnny the fox he called to jimmy the weed
He said "hey man, I know your name"
I seen you cruising with the low riders
Hanging out down on first street and main

Tuned into and listen to the hoodoo rhythm devils
Around the bay
They've got some crazy djs
Send you right out to heaven

Jimmy the weed for greed was taken aback
Johnny the fox you old sly cat
Cleverly the fox concealed his stash
Crisp dollar bills leave no tracks

In the back of a black cadillac
The voodoo music travels
Down skid row only black men can go
The shady deal unravels

Johnny the fox, hot to hustle
Jimmy the weed won't use no muscle
That cat's so sly, slick and subtle
Johnny the fox breaks out the bottle

Tuned into and listening to
The voodoo music travels
The beating drum for the lonely one
Sends you out to heaven
