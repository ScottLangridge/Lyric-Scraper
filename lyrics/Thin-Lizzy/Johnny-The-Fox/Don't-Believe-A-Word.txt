Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
There just might be some other silly pretty girl
I'm singing it to

Don't believe a word
For words are so easily spoken
And your heart is just like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe a word
'Cause words can tell lies
And lies are no comfort
When there's tear in your eyes

Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you

Don't believe a word
No Don't believe a word
Don't believe it, don't believe it
Not a single word
Hey, don't
