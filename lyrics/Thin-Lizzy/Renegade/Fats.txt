Check out fats, he's a real cool cat
He's got a black and white tux with lots of class
He says, "i love that jazz. I love that razz-ma-tazz.i love to swing."
"i just go crazy when you give me room to do my thing." that's fats

Well, check out fats, he's a real cool cat
He's got bright white spats and sharp dark trilby hat
He's got a chick that's slick and I like her looks
And I like the way her lipstick, it matches the carnation on his tux

I love his jazz, I love his style, it makes me feel so nice
Oh fats, won't you play for ma a while?  That's fats
Oh well, sigmund freud, he gets very annoyed
He was checking out fats and waller just don't like that cat

He said, "i don't like his looks, I don't like his fashion."
I love his jazz, I love his style, it makes me feel so nice
Oh fats, won't you play for me a while?  Not that fats
He's such a real cool cat, that's fats. Nobody plays that jazz, not like fats
