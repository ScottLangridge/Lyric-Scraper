Oh my god
There's millions of them!

I've seen a fire start in frisco
The day that the earth quaked
I've seen buildings a-blazing
Throwing up in flames

I heard men, women and children
Crying out to their God for mercy
But their God didn't listen
So they were burned alive

They went down, down, deep underground
In the great disaster

I was hanging out in berlin
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine
I've seen hitler's storm troopers
March right across the maginot line

I've seen two world wars
I've seen men send rockets out into space
I foresee a holocaust
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race

Down, down, deep undergound
A great disaster

In the sixteenth century there was a french philosopher
By the name of nostradamus
Who prophesised that in the late twentieth century
An angel of death shall waste this land

A holocaust the likes of which
This planet had never seen
Now, I ask you
Do you believe this to be true?

I was standing by the bedside
The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God he said, "have mercy, mercy!"

His body was riddled with a disease
Unknown to man so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

He went down, down, deep underground
A great disaster

You'll go down, down, deep underground
A great disaster

I think they've got now!


Angel of death (lynott, wharton) [lorelei version]
--------------

I was hanging round in frisco
In the year of one hundred and nineteen six
When I heard about the earthquake
The world trembled from within

I saw the fire ragin
Through all that time I heard people dying
They went down, down, deep underground
In the great disaster

I was hanging out in berline
In the year one hundred nineteen and thirty nine
I've seen hitler's storm troopers
March right across the maginot line

I've seen men run away crying "gas!"
Right in front of their throats
I wouldn't think that I was squeezing
They went down, down, deep underground a great disaster

I was standing at the bedside
That night my father died
I could see him crying for mercy
A disease had got his body

I was afraid then
As I am now
The lord did not hear him
He went anyhow

He went down, down, deep underground
It was a disaster
I will go down, down, underground
To meet my master

Down, down
