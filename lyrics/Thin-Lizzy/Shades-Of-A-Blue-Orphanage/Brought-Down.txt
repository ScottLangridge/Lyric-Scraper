I was seldom sober in nineteen hundred and fifthy-four
Hey baby, maybe 'cause my baby had a baby by me
And I was still drinking dry gin
While you cried "no, no more"
And you were lyin' and a-cryin',
And your tears fell dying on the floor

And I'm brought down,
And I don't think I can get up again
Brought down,
My heart is hurt again

You were the fine lady in the early mornings
That always painted her toes
And lookin' towards the east
You'd say hello to the early dawn before they rose
And you were the love lady
That always hung up her finely pressed clothes
And sayin' so long to the western sundown,
You taught me how it grows

And I'm brought down,
And I don't think I can get up again
Brought down,
And you just hurt my heart again
Brought down
Brought down
I'm brought down

Brought down
Brought down
Brought down
Down

I'm brought down,
And I don't think I can get up again
I'm brought down,
I'm hurt, it's bad
[brought down]
God, it's a shame there's no more dr. Strangely strange {dss=1960/70's band}
[brought down]
And I'm brou.....[brought down]...... Ught down
[brought down]
And there must be more to life than this
