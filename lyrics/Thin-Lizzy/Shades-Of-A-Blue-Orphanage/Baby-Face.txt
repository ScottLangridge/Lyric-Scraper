Put up, baby face
I love your lipstick, baby face,
It makes me all shades of red
Give me wild while you do to me one,
Make me hot when I should be sleeping in my bed
I love your big eyes, baby face,
They seem to suggest much more than you say
I love the mark in your secret place, oow baby face
Love is like a peppermint machine, that's green, it's green
I love your hair down, baby face,
And I can picture ya as you do, oow, with your fingers running through
I love ya, baby face,
The way you bite your lips, ooo... Ow!
How 'bout (the) baby face? {repeat 17 times}
