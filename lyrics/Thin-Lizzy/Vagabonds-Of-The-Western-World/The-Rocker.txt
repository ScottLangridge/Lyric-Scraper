I am your main man if you're looking for trouble
I'll take no lip 'cause no ones tougher than me
If I kicked your face you'd soon be seeing double
Hey little girl, keep your hands off me 'cause I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker!
I'm a roller too, baby
I'm a rocker!

Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stompin'
Bippin' an a boppin', telling a dirty joke or two
In walked this chick and I knew she was up to something
I kissed her right there out of the blue

I said "Hey baby, meet me I'm a tough guy"
Got my cycle outside, you wanna try?
She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes
And said "Ooh I'd do anything for you 'cause you're a rocker"
That's right I'm a rocker!
I'm a roller too, honey
I'm a rocker!

I love to rock and roll
I get my records from the Rock On stall
Rock and roll
Teddy boy, he's got them all, all, all, all, all

(guitar solo)

(Ro-cker)
I love to rock and roll
I get my records from the Rock On stall
Sweet rock and roll
Teddy boy, he's got them all, all, all, all, all
(I'm a Rocker)
