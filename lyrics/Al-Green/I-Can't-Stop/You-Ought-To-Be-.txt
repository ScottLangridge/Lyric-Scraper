You ought to be with me
Al Green
(A. Green, W. Mitchell, A. Jackson)

Sit right down and talk to me,
About how you want to be,
You ought to be with me,
Ya, you ought to be with me.

Thinking about what people do,
Talking about how I love you,
Thinking there's nothing to what they say,
You ought to be with me, anyway.

They don't want to see us do,
All of the dumb things we want to,
You ought to be with me,
Hey, you ought to be with me.

You don't have to waste my time,
If you want to be a friend of mine,
You can be denied and walk away,
And turn your back for another day.

You ought to be the kind of girl,
That can brighten up this old world,
And it's hard to see why you and me,
Can't be together happily.

I'm trying to realize,
You being with some other guy,
I don't know the reason why,
You ought to be with me until I die.

(you ought to be with me until I die)

I don't want to waste my time,
If you want to be a friend of mine,
I want to hold you tight, love you right,
Put good feelin' in your night.
