Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this world keeps on turning
Let's just be glad we have this time to spend together
There is no need to watch the bridges that were burning
[Chorus:]
Lay your head on my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blow softly against my window pain late at night
Make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
For the good times
I'll get along I'm sure you'll find another
But baby please remember I'll be here
I'm gone stay right here if you should ever find that you need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow forever and ever and ever
There will be time enough for severence when you need me
[Chorus:]
