Spending my day,
Thinkin' about you,
Being here with you,
Being near with you,
Can't explain myself,
Feel like I do.
Though it hurt me so,
To let you know,
When I look in your eyes,
Let me know,
How you feel.
Let me know,
That our lovin' is real,
When it seems to me,
That I'm wrapt up in your love,
Don't you know,
That I'm still in love with you,
Sure enough in love with you.

That I'm still in love with you,
Sure enough in love with you.

When I look in your eyes,
Through all the years,
I see me lovin' you,
And you lovin' me,
But it seemed to me,
That I'm wrapt up in your love,
Don't you know,
That I'm still in love with you,
Sure enough in love with you.

Don't you know,
That I'm still in love with you,
Sure enough in love with you,
Ya I try to do what you want me to...
