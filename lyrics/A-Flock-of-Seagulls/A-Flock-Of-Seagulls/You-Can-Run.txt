What's this I see?
You're try'n' to hide
Away from me,
Away from me.

Don't you know
That you can run
But you can't hide
Away.

No, you won't find
Your piece of mind
Away from me,
Away from me.

And in your mind
You will not find
Your piece of mind
Today.

You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide, (no, you can't hide)
You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide
Away.

You're part of me,
I'm part of you.
What can we do?
What can we do?

I am your sin
Living within,
It's up to you.
What can we do?

The more you run,
The more you hide
Me down inside
Your head.

The more they see
The you in me
The more your life
Is dead.

You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide, (no, you can't hide)
You can run, (no, you can't run)
You can hide
Away.

What's this I see?
You're try'n' to hide
Away from me,
Away from me.

Don't you know
That you can run
But you can't hide
Away.
