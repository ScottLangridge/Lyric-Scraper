We fell in love down at the pier.
You were sunbathing, I was around.
Soon we were sharing a beer.
We fell in love at the pier.
I'm no sentimental slob so don't think I'm queer.
You got somethin' baby, and it ain't just my beer.
Well, maybe it's the hot pants, maybe the heat, or was it the sneakers you kicked of your feet?
I sat under my umbrella to keep my pearly skin.
You tanned your oily body looking like sin.
Well, soon I was sweatin' and I wanted to leave.
You slipped into the water from to much grease.
Well, I saw you yelling.
I just couldn't hear, so I screamed back at ya "Honey keep the beer!"
We never consummated our outside love affair.
Too much tar and water.
Too much hot air.
Oh, what a tragic end to love that was lost.
We would have stood a chance if we met in the frost, but...
We fell in love down at pier.
You were sunbathing, I was around.
Now I go to beaches with my girlfriend.
No more love splinters in my rear end.
