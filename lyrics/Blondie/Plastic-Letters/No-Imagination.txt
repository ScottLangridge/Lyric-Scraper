Eyes that tell me "baby, you don't need no invitation".
Let me smoke another cigarette before I make a move.
I can see me in the morning; losing my direction, deep inside my overcoat, looking for the door.
I don't wanna stay with you.
I just wanna play with you.
One sweet abbreviation sleeping like the dead.
You think you're pretty, well, so do I.
You came to me but, passion eyes, got no imagination to clutter up my head.
Eyes that mirror innocence and cannot sense the changes.
Lets have another drink, dear, before we get deranged.
I can see me in the morning; avoiding your detection, slowly down the staircase, looking for the door.
All is fair in love and war but I don't want your love no more.
One sweet abbreviation sleeping like the dead.
You're fragile and you're very green, conditioned by a milk machine.
Got no imagination.
Got no imagination.
No.
Take a walk, kid.
Eyes that tell me "baby, you don't need no invitation".
Let me smoke another cigarette before I make a move.
I can see me in the morning; losing my direction, deep inside my overcoat, footsteps for the door.
