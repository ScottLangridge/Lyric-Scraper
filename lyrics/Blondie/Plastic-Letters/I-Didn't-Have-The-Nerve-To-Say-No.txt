You got ants in your pants.
I don't understand.
I don't trust the flick of your eyes.
You're a viper and love's a fever.
You said something profane and went for a vein but in spite of your "delicate touch", I should have known as much: I'm a bleeder.
I didn't have the nerve to say no.
I didn't have the nerve to say no.
You caught me surprised and my will resigned.
Torture the minds of them all.
You're a brain drain, you'd better beat it.
I'm following lines.
The blind leads the blind.
So hang me or grant me a stay.
You better cut me loose or hand me a noose.
There's no end to the problem of a bad situation.
Complication.
No, no, no, no, ah.
There's no end to the problem and frustration.
I need a vacation.
No, no, no, no, ah.
And I know I couldn't.
And I know that I couldn't say no.
