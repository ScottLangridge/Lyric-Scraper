Uh hey! You've got an unnerving face and twitching eyes like Norman Bates.
You got a cigarette, eye on a mirror.
Farm boy brown gas station sweeper.
You took that girl, you put the saddle on her.
Just thirteen, she's her daddy's apple, and she don't know you're the kidnapper, uh-huh.
Uh hey! Your daddy's Whiskey Sam.
He's got bloodshot eyes like Ray Milland.
Playin' solitaire, your mother fidgets.
You wanna be rich but you won't dig ditches.
She bitches like a brat.
She got the money.
People breaking their necks and she thinks it's funny.
Where's your old man now?
Nobody's home, uh-huh.
Kidnapper.
Uh hey! They call you Skinny Jim and nobody knows the boat you're in.
They dipped your tail when you were back in school.
Well, you're a real strange cake but your nobody's fool.
So you took that girl and you put the saddle on her.
Just thirteen.
She's fresh out of diapers and she don't know your the kidnapper, uh-huh.
