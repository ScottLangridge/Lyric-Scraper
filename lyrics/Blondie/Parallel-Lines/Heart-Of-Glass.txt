Once I had a love and it was a gas, soon turned out
Had a heart of glass.
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.

Once I had a love and it was divine.
Soon found out I was losing my mind.
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind.
Mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.

In between "what I find is pleasing" and "I'm feeling fine",
Love is so confusing.
There's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you.
It's just no good, you teasing like you do.

Once I had a love and it was a gas,
Soon turned out had a heart of glass.
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.

Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide.
I'm the one you're using please don't push me aside.
We could make it cruising, ye-ah.

(La la la)(lalalalala)(la la la)(lalalala)(la la la)(lalalala)

Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Ooh ooh ooh whoa (x4)

Once I had a love and it was a gas,
Soon turned out, I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.
Ooh ooh ooh whoa (x4)
