You're gonna say you miss me.
You're gonna say you'll kiss me.
You're gonna say you love me 'cause I'm gonna love you too.
I don't care what you told me.
You're gonna say you'll hold me.
You're gonna say you love me 'cause I'm gonna love you too.
After all another fella took ya, but I still can't overlook ya.
I'm gonna do my best to hook ya after all is said and done.
I don't care what you told me.
You're gonna say you'll hold me and you're gonna say you love me 'cause I'm gonna love you too.
You're gonna tell me sweet things.
You're gonna make my heart sing and I'm gonna hear bells ring 'cause I'm gonna love you too.
You're gonna say you miss me and you're gonna say you'll kiss me and you're gonna say you love me 'cause I'm gonna love you too.
I'm gonna love you too.
I'm gonna love you too.
I'm gonna love you too.
