I know a girl from a lonely street,
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet.
Dry your eyes, sunday girl.
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl.
Looks like he's in another world.
Run and hide, sunday girl.

Hurry up, hurry up and wait.
I stay away all week and still I wait.
I got the blues.
Please come see,
What your lovin means to me.

She can't catch up with the working crowd.
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud.
Live in dreams, sunday girl.
"Baby, I would like to go out tonight".
"If I go with you my folks will get uptight".
Stay at home, sunday girl. (uuuuuh)

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl.
Looks like he's in another world.
Run and hide, sunday girl.
When, I saw you again in the summer time,
If your love was as sweet as mine,
I could be sunday's girl.

Hurry up, hurry up and wait.
I stay away all week and still I wait.
I got the blues.
Please come see,
What your lovin means to me.
Hurry up!
Hurry up, hurry up and wait.
I got the blues, please, please..
Please come see,
What you do to me.
I got the blues..

Hurry up!
Hurry up, hurry up and wait.
Hurry up!
Please come see,
What you do to me.
