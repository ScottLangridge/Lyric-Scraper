My name is Little Caesar.
My friends call me lc.
My Daddy's named the same and passed it on to me.
I'm the kinda guy who by and by who wants to be your friend.
I'll make you a happy ending.
I loop the loo.
I do it good.
I've been called a lot of names, some of them obscene.
But you think I'm funny and wonder about me? I don't worry anymore, get uptight, or fear.
Back in the days of "funny" funny they called me queer.
They used to call me.
They called me rudely.
I'm a love 'em and leave 'em kinda fella, a goodtime gentleman.
Perform my magic for ya then I'll make my plan.
When I'm gone you'll feel so low: obsession out-a-hand.
You'll find I'll linger in your mind.
You can't forgive me.
You won't forget me.
You can't live without me.
Can't live without me.
You'll find there's not enough and that you love too much.
Can't live without me.
You can't live with me.
Can't live without me.
Just call me Caesar.
You can't forgive me.
You won't forget me.
I'm Little Caesar, yea.
