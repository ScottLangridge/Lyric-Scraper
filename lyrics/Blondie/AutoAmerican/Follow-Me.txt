Far from day, far from night, out of time, out of sight, in between earth and sea, we shall fly.
Follow me.
Dry the rain, warm the snow where winds never go.
Follow me.
Follow me to a cave by a sapphire shore where we'll walk through an emerald door, and for thousands of breathless "evermore"s my life you will be.
Only you.
Only I.
World farewell.
World goodbye.
To our home 'neath the sea we shall fly.
Follow me.
