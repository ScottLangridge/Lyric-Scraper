Based on the desire for total mobility
And the serious physical pursuit of religious freedom
The auto drove mankind further than the wheel

And in remote areas even today is forbidden as a device too suspect for human conveyance
This articulate conception has only brought us all more of the same
Thoughtlessly locked into phase two gridlock
Keyed up on its rims and abandoned on the expressway
