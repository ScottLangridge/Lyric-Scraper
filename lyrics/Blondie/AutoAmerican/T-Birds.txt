[Intro]
Circle high, circle low
Jammers fly, T-birds
You show, you show, whiplash go
You show, you show, T-birds
Mighty bird
T-bird, my mighty bird

[Verse 1]
On the dot in the slot, tie the knot
On the dot timed kisses
In the slot on the dot, tie the knot
In the slot, no misses

[Verse 2]
Mighty bird
T-bird, my mighty bird
T-bird, mighty bird
Black sun conqueror

Black sun worshipper

[Verse 3]
Coil it up, wind it out, strike it hot
Coil it up plumed serpent
Coil it up, wind it out, strike it hot
Coil it up, my T-bird

[Verse 4]
Serpent curl
T-bird, rule the world
T-bird, mighty bird
Black sun born again

[Outro]
Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
