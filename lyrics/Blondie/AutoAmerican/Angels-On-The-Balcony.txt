Afterglow in a distant world.
The door is open and the lights are cold.
The children come in here and they dare the ghost, like a fire burning in a stove.
Silent light and the feeling's right.
Phantom cigarette and a silent cry.
The door swings open and it's cold outside.
Run and hide, run and hide.
They can still see 'em singing on the corner.
Singing songs that never fade away, fade into the kids that come along.
Memory in a silent sea.
Memory on a long retreat.
Like an angel on a balcony.
Like an angel on a balcony.
