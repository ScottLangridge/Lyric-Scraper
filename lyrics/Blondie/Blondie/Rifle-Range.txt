I was all alone with the scent of a bone and my heart was stuck in this emptiness zone.
I had not a care, though I wanted to hear the voice of a maiden who was playing down there...
At the rifle range, I lost my heart.
At the rifle range, I could not start.
At the rifle range, she left me so hot!
At the rifle range.
Like a victim of truce I was strung on a noose cracking at the news of a prey let loose.
I turned around to stare at the face she would wear and I ran through the gallows, her heart was down there.
At the rifle range, I lost my heart.
At the rifle range, I could not start.
At the rifle range, I heard a shot!
At the rifle range.
If I lose my head, we'll be certainly dead, with visions of acid, how I wish they bled.
The drummings of fear cause they're getting so near and I think of a lion who was devoured down there.
Yeah yeah yeah! At the rifle range, I lost my heart.
At the rifle range, I could not start.
At the rifle range, I heard a shot.
At the rifle range, she left me so hot!
At the rifle range, Bang bang!
At the rifle range, Bang bang!
At the rifle range, Bang bang!
