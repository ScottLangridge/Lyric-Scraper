Darlin' darlin' darlin', I can't wait to see you.
Your picture ain't enough.
I can't wait to touch you, in the flesh.
Darlin' darlin' darlin', I can't wait to hear you.
Remembering your love is nothing without you in the flesh.
Went walking one day on the lower east side.
Met you with a girlfriend. You were so divine!
She said, "Hands off, this one's sweet, this boy is mine."
I couldn't resist you - I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind.
Darlin' darlin' darlin', now you're out of town.
Those girls that you run with, they bring my head down.
Ooh Darlin' darlin', watch out if I see you!
'Cause if you say hello, it'll mean you wanna see me, in the flesh.
Ooh warm and soft, in the flesh.
Ooh close and hot, in the flesh.
Ooh.
