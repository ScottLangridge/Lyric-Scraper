No explanation
No words describe
Serving sentence in your head
You murder time
Some waiting station
One endless night
Take the empty trains to nowhere
In your idle mind

And sometimes I feel like the last one on the planet
(Only one, the only one)
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world
(Only one, the only one)
Don't get so near to me
Don't disappear on me
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world

Here comes the morning
Venetian blind
I'll do the haunting
I'm killing time
It's dark on Broadway
It's kind of like
Walking down the lonely streets
In your idle mind

And sometimes I feel like the last one on the planet
(Only one, the only one)
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world
(Only one, the only one)
Don't get so near to me
Don't disappear on me
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world

Don't get so near to me
Don't disappear on me
Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world
(Only one, the only one)
[repeats twice after musical break]


Sometimes I feel like the last one in the world
(Only one, the only one)
I'm the only one, I'm the last one in the world
(Only one, the only one)
I'm the only one, I'm the last one in the world

(Only one, the only one)[repeats to fade]
