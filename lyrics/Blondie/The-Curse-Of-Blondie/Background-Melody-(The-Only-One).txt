I know what i'm made of
By what's inside of me
Maybe science, maybe giants
Maybe just a mystery
Maybe the mother of invention
Is really intensity
And baby when they made you
I was the background melody
A partner to the feeling
Now you're a part of me

So be the only one who cares
The only one who dares
The only one who sees
The only one who dreams
Be the only one who tries
The only one who cries
Be the only one for me, for me

Don't think i'm fantasizing
I didn't make it up
Lots of people tell me things
Things about their love
How the music that was playing low
How they made you in the afterglow
I didn't see 'em do the body rock
I didn't feel the after shocks
But baby when they made you
I was the background melody

So be the only one who cares
The only one who dares
The only one to dance
The one who takes a chance
Be the only one who's real
The only one who feels
Be the only one who loves

You may think i'm egocentric
But i'm only centered some of the time
I want you to remember
I wanna be the tune you can't get out of your mind

I wasn't there to see the pressure drop
I didn't do the momma and pop
Baby when they made you I was the background melody
Was it the lady or the tiger
Who was the bottom who was the top
Oh baby when they made you I was the background melody

So be the only one who cares
The only one who dares
The only one who sees
The only one who dreams
Be the only one who tries
The only one who cries
Be the only one for me, for me
