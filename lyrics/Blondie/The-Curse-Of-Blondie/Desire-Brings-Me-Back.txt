The bliss of the wild
The dark heat of your body
Black in the blackness around me
The fallacy of a dream

The bliss of the wild
The dark raging tide
Deep as the sea
Deep as the sea inside of me

I offer myself to the danger in you
To your fierce elctricity
You're the fire in my burning soul
I shake in the wilderness above
I'll always be back
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Back to the earth

Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been
Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been

The bliss of the wild
And it's a matter of flesh and love
Your warm breath on my face
Your skin drinks my soul

The bliss of the wild
The sound of your blood flowing oveare me
The irresistable color of the moon
And they make it(?) by your love

How can I feel so free when I'm so bound to you?
To the power of our imaging
To the madness of our passion
To the wilderness of our love
I'll always come back
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Back to the earth

Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been
Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been

The bliss of the wild
The danger is electric
You're the fire in my soul
I shake in the wilderness
I feel you pull like the moon
The galaxy is a dream

Desire brings me back
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Back to the earth
Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been
Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been
Desire brings me back
Back to where I've always been
Desire, desire
Desire brings me back
