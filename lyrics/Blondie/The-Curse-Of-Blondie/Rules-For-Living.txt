I'm another life
When the gods were crazy
And the measurement of time
Were the ending seasons
And maybe we believed
There was anger in the storm

Sometimes the Sky reminds me

And if you think that's wild
There's my dream of Egypt
And the colour of the Nile
You're a Roman Soilder
It's small world after all
But's older than you think

Sometimes your eyes remind me
Don't know why
I'll wait a lifetme till you find me
There are times

Mmmm I've been this way before
Mmmm I'll come this way again
So many things remind me
So many things inside

Sometimes your eyes remind me
Don't know why
I'll wait a lifetme till you find me
There are times

Mmmm I've been this way before
Mmmm I'll come this way again
So many things remind me
So many things inside

In another life
When the gods were crazy
And complaining all the time
And the people look at me
The volocano wants a bribe
And I'm still afraid of fire

Mmmm I've been this way before
Mmmm I'll come this way again
So many things remind me
So many things inside

Mmmm I've been this way before
Mmmm I'll come this way again
So many things remind me
So many things inside
