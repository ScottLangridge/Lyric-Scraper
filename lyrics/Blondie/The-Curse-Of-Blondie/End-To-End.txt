Just  when our number's up
You smashed the loving cup
It spills out everywhere
It simply isn't fair

We light up fire flies
We kissed on New Years Night
We changed the century
All those romantic things

We changed the light to low
It made our spirits glow
If it were up to me
I'd never let you go

So If By Chance
You Should agree
Ohh tonight
We keep it Real
Toinght
We put an End to the End
And just go on and on

We wrote our name in lights
Made music every night
Heatwaves and rhapsody
Burn In my memory

We changed the light to low
It made our spirits glow
If it were up to me
I'd never let you go

So If By Chance
You Should agree
Ohh tonight
We keep it Real
Toinght
We put an End to the End
And just go on and on

Toinght
We put an End to the End
And just go on and on

Tonight
We Put
An End to the End
And just go on and on and on and
On and on and on and on
To the End the End the End
We try to put the End to End to End
End the End
End to the End the End the End
End To End
End To End
