I'm hot as a fire burning bright I feel as empty as air
There is no sense of balance
In the howling wind that calls to me
I can feel it everywhere but it's invisible to me
Distractions and spirit find me floating in a magnetic sea
The nights are phosphorescent
And the days are beautiful and bright
Until whispering mist it comes falling down on me
Oh there's fire burning
Looking for the magic
In the night time all this
Brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be
It's in the night time alleys
Winding through my deepest memory
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me
I'm looking for the magic in the places I remember it to be
And just one simple thought brings the magic back to me
