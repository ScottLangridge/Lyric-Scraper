La La La La La
La La La La La La La
La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La La La

Was that an invitation
Can you explain I'm so impatient
Hey rise to the occasion
Can you explain the reason
Why you took a second look, a second look

I saw you once, met you twice
Oooh your presence feels so nice
Your silent, get your tongue untied
When the night goes still you open wide
You've got to say uh huh
Before I come undone

You got a sweet expression
Is that the spot that I should kiss on
Hey tell me, can you hear me
You've got to raise your voice because the music's loud
You've got to shout, spit it out

It seems like you've got a funny way
Eyes that tell her you can't say
I sure would like to read your mind
Your speechless and I've tried and tried
You've got to say uh huh
Before I come undone

Right from the start your kissing lips are undone
If you just say something,
I won't tell you to shut it up

La La La La La
La La La La La La La
La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La La La

It's like an application,
You fill it in the open spaces
Because I've been over taking,
And I'm so sick of waiting
One, two, three, answer me, answer me

I saw you once, met you twice
Oooh your presence feels so nice
Your silent, get your tongue untied
When the night goes still you open wide
You've got to say uh huh
Before I come undone

I saw you once, met you twice
Oooh your presence feels so nice
Your silent, get your tongue untied
When the night goes still you open wide
You've got to say uh huh
Before I come undone
