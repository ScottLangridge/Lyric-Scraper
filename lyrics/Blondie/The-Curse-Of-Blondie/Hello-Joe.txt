I saw you taping thunder from your balcony
Saving the sounds
Don't trust your memory

I see you catch the lightning
Hold it up so you can see
Through the open windows
Looking down at me

Let's wake the roosters
Nighttime's gonna go
We'll walk and talk years of
Before the light begins to show
Let's wake the roosters
Nice to know you Joe
Let's wake the roosters
Hola Joe

Catch the sunrise in a glass
If you turn your back you'll miss it
Coming up real fast

Set your trap for nighttime
You lie down in the dark
Listen to the thunder
Listen to my heart

Let's wake the roosters
Nighttime's gonna go
We'll walk and talk yeaars of
Before the light begins to show
Let's wake the roosters
Nice to know you Joe
Let's wake the roosters
Hey-ho ola Joe

Caught you in the rain
It took you by surprise
I'll take you home and dance with you
Until your clothes are dry

Place your finger on my pulse
I'll keep the sign of you
Keep it nice and close

And when I feel the Breath of spring
On my face
I know the silent sound of you
Won't be erased

Let's wake the rooserts
Nighttime's gonna go
We'll walk and talk years of
Before the light begins to show
Let's wake the roosters
Nice to know you Joe
Let's wake the roosters
Hey-ho ola Joe
