Oh ho, oh ho, what are we gonna do?
Union, Union, Union City blue.
Tunnel to the other side.
It becomes daylight.
I say he's mine.
Ohhh, power/passion plays a double hand.
Union, union union city man.
Arrive, climb up four flights to the orange side.
Rearrange my mind.
In turquoise Union, Union, Union City blue.
Ohhhh Skyline, passion, Union City blue.
Mmmmmmmm Power/passion plays a double hand.
Union, union union city man.
I say he's mine.
I have a plan.
I say he's my Union City man.
Oho, oho, what are we gonna do?
Union, union, union city blue.
