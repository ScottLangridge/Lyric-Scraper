There are many things to talk about
Be constructive

There are weapons, we can use
Be constructive
With your blues

You really turn the water red
You really turn the water green

Won't you quiet down?
We really wanted to go to sleep
Won't you quiet down?
We want peace we want to sleep
Won't you quiet down?
But you won't even promise me you will
Won't you quiet down?
You won't even touch us now you know that we're framed

You don't like living in a buisness world
You don't have goals and you never stay
There are no more goals in our liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it

Its all through the neighbours grill
I'll roll on and maybe I can see out of here
It's all over the globe this day
It's all over the globe so let me out of here
It's all over the world

Won't you quiet down
Won't you quiet down
We are the dollars and cents
And the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen
And yeah were gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents
And the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence
And yeah we're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents
