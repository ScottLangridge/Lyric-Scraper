Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak it's name
Dedicated to all you
All human beings

Because we separate like
Ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate like
Ripples on a blank shore

Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all you
All human beings
