I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am holidays that you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who justs wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I wanna stick with you, because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the breeze

It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
