I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Ooooohhhh

Make a sound
Move back home
Pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about

I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Ooooohhhh

Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
You can fight it like a dog
And they brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in
All the lies run around my face
All the lies run around my face
And for anybody else to see
And for anybody else to see

I'm alive...

Oh no no no no no no no no no no no no ma ma. (X3)

I've seen it coming. (X4)
