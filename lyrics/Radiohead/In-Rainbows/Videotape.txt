When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape
My videotape

Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
In red, blue, green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape

On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you
After it's too late
From my videotape

No matter what happens now
I won't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seen
