Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt
Don't blow your mind with why

I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(I dive into those eyes)
I dive into those eyes
(Jellyfish go by)
Jellyfish go by
