I will shrink myself into your pocket
Invisible, do what you want, do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off. You cut me off

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I've set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As Lotus Flowers
Cause all is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feel your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We will shrink and be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away, do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I set you free
I set you free

Cause all is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is

Mmmmm Moments float into my room

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all is the moon upon a stick
To Dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feel your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
