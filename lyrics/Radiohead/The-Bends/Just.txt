Can't get the stink out
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
Teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts is
You do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging at the 15th floor
You've changed the lock 3 times
I still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest Hell

You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts is
You do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts is
You do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

(You do it to yourself)
(You do it to yourself)
(You do it to yourself)
(You do it to yourself)
