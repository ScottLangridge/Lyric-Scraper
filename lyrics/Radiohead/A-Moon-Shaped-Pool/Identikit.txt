Sleep fast...
That we all want
That we all know
(Want to sleep and need to woah)

Sleep fast...
That we all want
That we all know
Sleep fast...

That we all want
That we all know
I don't want to walk
I don't want to know

I don't want to...
... Not want me around
I don't want to want
I don't want to know.

But I'll take a hint.
But I'll take a hint.
But I'll take a hint.
But I'll take a hint.
But I'll take a hint.
But I'll take a hint.
But I'll take a hint.
But I'll...

But what she said doesn't matter
... That you can't create
That you can't...
That you can't...
That you can't...
That you can't...

When I see the mess in me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know.

Once you sifted me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
