I slipped away
I slipped on a little white lie
We've got heads on sticks
We've got ventiloquists
We've got heads on sticks
We've got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Waiting in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

Rats and children follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
C'mon kids
