The morning bell
The morning bell
I don't know the killer
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me

Where did you park the car?
Where did you park the car?
Always the one with the furniture
Well I might as well
Might as well
Sleeping the fire drill
Running around, around, around
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

And everything starts to bleed
And everybody lies to me
And everybody talks to me
When I am walking
Walking walking walking walking

Everybody lies to polls
And everybody starts to tease
So tell your boy you'll never believe
And tell your boy you don't believe
Now tell your cousin
Walking walking walking walking walking walking

Everybody lies to polls
And everybody starts to tell
Everyone wants to be there
Everyone wants to be the same
Walking walking walking walking walking walking
