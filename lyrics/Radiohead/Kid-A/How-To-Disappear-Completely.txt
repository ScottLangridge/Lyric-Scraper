That man, that's not me
I go, where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
I know what I've seen
You throw me out then send me back again
In a little while I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone
Yeah, it's gone
Yeah, it's gone
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
I'm not here
