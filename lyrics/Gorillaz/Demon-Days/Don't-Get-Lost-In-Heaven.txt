Got off the plane
To the country side
A door to the mountain
And a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner
And someone dead and
Fire coming out of a monkey's head

Chorus:
Don't get lost in heaven,
They got locks on the gate.
Don't go over the edge,
You'll make a big mistake.

Put me in a cab to suburbia,
I just took a line but I wasn't with ya,
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul,
You're a hoe girl
Yeah, you're a hobo..

Chorus:
Don't get lost in heaven,
They got locks on the gate.
Don't go over the edge,
You'll make a big mistake.

Aaaah...
You'll make a big mistake.
Aaaah...
You'll make a big mistake.
Aaaah...
You'll make a big mistake.
Aaaah...
You'll make a big mistake.
Aaaah...
