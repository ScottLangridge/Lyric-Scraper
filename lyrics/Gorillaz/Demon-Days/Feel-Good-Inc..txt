City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see.
You won't get out the county, cause you're damn ass free.
You've got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style,
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, I gotta kiss, because I don't get sleep, no...

*Beep*

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking falling down...
Love forever, Love is free
Lets turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land-
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Linin' em up like ass cracks,
Ladies ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in heart of this here
Care bear bumpin' in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaa.

Yo, we go ghost town,
This Motown,
With your sound
You win the blink.
Gon' bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound
You kill the inc.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you're cheddar header.
Watch the way I navigate
Hahahahahahaa!

Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good

(Wait about 24 seconds until he starts singing again)

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking falling down...
Love forever Love is free
Lets turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land-
Is everybody in?

Don't stop, get it, get it,
We are your captains in it. Steady,
Watch me navigate,
Ahahahahahhaa

Don't stop, get it, get it,
We are your captains in it. Steady,
Watch me navigate,
Ahhahahahaa

Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, Feel good

Ahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
