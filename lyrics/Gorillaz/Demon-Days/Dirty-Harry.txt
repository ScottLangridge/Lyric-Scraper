I need a gun to keep myself from harm
All the poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
Cos all I do is dance
Cos all I do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself from harm
All the poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
Cos all I do is dance
Cos all I do is dance

In my backpack
I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your resolve weakens
With anger and discontent
Some are seekin in seach of like Nimoy

I'm a peace-loving decoy
Ready for retaliation
I change the whole location
To a pine box six-under
Impulsive-don't ask why or wonder
Orders given unto me is:
Strike and I'm thunder
With lightning fast reflexes
On constant alert
From the constant hurt
That seems limitless
With no drop in pressure
Seems like everybody's
Out to test ya
'til they see your brake
You can't conceal the hate
That consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu.

Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days extension
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
Mine's from a canteen

At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life,
It seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert
With my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker
With his flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

(Dance!)
(Dance!)
(Dance!)

I need a gun to keep myself from harm
