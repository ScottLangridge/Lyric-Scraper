Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls

Take a gun
Or how you say
That's no way
To behave

It's just a law, and you begin
To sing a song that doesn't sin
It grows
Hey, you know

Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last to get away
To some another day
Or do we know
Well we know
Doesn't seem to be complete
Are we

Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls
Are we the last living souls

Get up, get up, get up, get up...

Cause all out of song
I got it down wrong
I see myself to get
The lord sees it all now,
Can you take us in
The part that comin' on
The coldest man doesn't sing your song

We go to the car
I see you walk to the far
And when you get there do you see
You fit the last you need on me

Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls!
