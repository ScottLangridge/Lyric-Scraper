Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Taking over
But it won't be long
They mesmerized, skeletons
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say "no" to

Drinking out (Push it real, push it)
Pacifier (Push it real, push it)
Vitamin Souls(push it real, push it)
The Street desire Push it real, push it
Doesn't make sense to (Push it real, push it)
But it won't be long (Push it real, push it)
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say "no" to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
Where you are
Doesn't make sense to
But it won't be long
Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to "no" to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Push it real push it push it
Push it real push it push it
Push it real push it push it
Push it real push it push it
Push it real push it push it

Push It, Push It, Real
