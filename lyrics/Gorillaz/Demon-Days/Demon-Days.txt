In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down falling down
Falling out to go far from the soul (ah)

2x
In these demon days
It's so cold inside
So hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
Because mother earth wants us all to leave
When life become reality
You drown yourself with drugs and t.v.
Lift yourself up it's a brand new day
So turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around
Into the sun!

To the sun, to the sun...
To the sun, to the sun...
