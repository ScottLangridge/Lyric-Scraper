[Verse 1: 2-D]
Hey
What is this droning?
I hear it, then
Over on me

[Chorus: 2-D]
Everybody cool down
Everybody see yourself
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody hold on
Everybody hold on to your inner visions

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Hey
What is this droning?
I hear it, then
Over on me

[Chorus: 2-D]
Everybody cool down
Everybody see yourself
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody mining
Everybody mining their own inner visions
Everybody lie down
Everybody cool down
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody hold on
Everybody hold on to your inner visions

[Choir]
Hold on
To hope, yeah
