[Verse 1]
I'm on the high ridge looking down
While we're evolving, I get old
If I get back then I'll be grateful
Look there's a billboard on the moon

[Verse 2]
Let me take you this far
This crossing isn't much to me
There's lightning in the storm clouds
And I'll send you there to stay

[Chorus]
You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

[Post-Chorus]
Magic City
Magic City
Magic City
Magic City

[Verse 3]
You put me up here in the penthouse
And painted me in red, white and blue
I filled the canyons with my ego
Look there's a billboard on the moon

[Chorus]
You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go
