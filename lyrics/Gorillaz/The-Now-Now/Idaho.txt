[Verse 1]
I landed on the silver lake
Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the moon
Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in wilderness
Another bullet hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

[Chorus]
Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And everyday I look out of the bus
Silver linings getting lost

[Verse 2]
Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all
"Ride on," said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinseltown is down the road
It's the bullet of the noose

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're playing it all for gods
Far away

[Chorus]
Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And everyday I look out of the bus
Silver linings getting lost
