[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
I got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Verse 1]
Am I incapable of healing?
The memory of my fall from grace in your heart
I'm on my journey home with no fuel, alone
I think I'll coast a while

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
I got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm about to solve it
Put my engine back into overdrive
So I can breathe again, photosynthesize again
With the green hills of my home

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
I got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

I'm not gonna cry
(Save the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

[Bridge]
But if I got it right, you'd tell me
And if I was wrong, then I'd disappear
But I'm incapable

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna cry
(Say the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream
