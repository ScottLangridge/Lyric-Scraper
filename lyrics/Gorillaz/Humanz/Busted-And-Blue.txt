[Verse 1: 2D]
Where does it come from?
When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe?
Through the lithium
Busted and blue

[Verse 2: 2D]
I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
So amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds away

[Chorus: 2D & Kelela]
All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

[Verse 3: 2D & Kelela]
Where do they come from?
The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body
'Til we're invisible
I'm with you throughout it, choose
Busted and blue

[Chorus: 2D & Kelela]
All my life
All my life
Beam a light on me
I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

[Outro: 2D]
Busted and blue
