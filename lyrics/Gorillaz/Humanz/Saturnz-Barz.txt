[Chorus: 2-D & Popcaan]
All my life
I'm in the stakin' bar
I got debts, I'm a debaser
All my life
Saturnz about to make love
And I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in
'Cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breaking
Are making you a personal debt

[Post-Chorus: The Humanz]
Whoa-oh
Whoa

[Break: 2-D & Popcaan & The Humanz]
With the holograms beside me (Whoa-oh)
I'll dance alone tonight (Whoa-oh)
In a mirrored world, are you beside me (Whoa)
(Whoa) All my life? (Whoa)
Distortion

[Chorus: 2-D & Popcaan]
All my life
I'm in the stakin' bar
I got debts, I'm a debaser
All my life
Saturnz about to make love
And I'm just a heartbreaker
All my life
And I won't get a take in
'Cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breaking
Are making you a personal debt
