(feat. Grace Jones)

[Intro: Grace Jones]
I am the ghost
Hahahahaaaaaaaaa...
Provocative
That's what I want

[Chorus: 2-D]
A cha-charger
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger
What is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger
What do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Post-Chorus: 2-D and Grace Jones]
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger

[Interlude: Grace Jones]
Okay
Yeah, okay
Hahaaaaaaa

[Chorus: 2-D]
A cha-charger
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting it from
A cha-charger
What is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
A cha-charger
What do you say now?
Thought you could use it when the flowers have grown
A cha-charger
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Post-Chorus: 2-D and Grace Jones]
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger
A cha-charger

[Bridge: Grace Jones]
I am the ghost
I am the sword
I am the ghost

[Chorus: 2-D & Grace Jones]
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting from
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What is the cause of it?
And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What do you say now?
Thought you could teach us as the flowers have grown
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, shukuchi

[Outro: Grace Jones & 2-D]
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
I'm inside you
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm in charge
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
