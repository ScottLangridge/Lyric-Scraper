(feat. Kali Uchis)

[Verse 1: 2-D]
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere dreading all day
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover (she's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

[Verse 2: 2-D]
She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another
And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar
Nothing to be justified yet
She the first I'm running with
She the one that get my collar
She the one I'm running with

[Chorus: 2-D]
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis & (2-D)]
I'm yellow, he was blue
It's nothing that he could hide
We made a green meadow
Whenever we would collide (she's my caller)
I died a thousand times
I did what I had to do
Hey, that's just how it goes
I'm still coming back to you

[Bridge: 2-D & (Kali Uchis)]
If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
(you, you, you)
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
(you, you, you, you)
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now
(she's my collar)
I don't take her number just don't think I'd call her
(you, you, you)
I take a damn summer dreading all day
(you, you, you, you)
I clear my system, I don't need no other
(you, you, you)
This is my persona, secret lover
(she's my collar)

[Chorus: 2-D]
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's the one I'm running with
She's my collar
Oh, she's my collar
