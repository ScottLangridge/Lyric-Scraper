(feat. De La Soul)

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

[Post-Chorus: 2D & Azekel]
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white, dirty
(Moments)
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white dirty
(Moments)
Shiver down my backbone

[Verse 1: Posdnuos]
De La is also back again (Uh-huh)
With a crew that's bound to pack 'em in (Uh-huh)
Got a girl who's up for the matin'
I sense the need in her grammar
Her nose has never been skatin' (Uh-huh)
But she's sippin' star constellation (Shit)
For real, her squirt game was so like 2Pac out of court run towards camera (Uh-huh)
Her response to that was just, "Check please"
Fuck that my man, you can't let these (Moments)
Pass you by like "tick tock"
So I'm smackin' the bottom like flip flops
Made her alarm ring (She screams)
And now we done, we passed the test
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments

[Post-Chorus: 2D & Azekel]
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white, dirty
(Moments)
Main event, yellow, red
Black, white dirty
(Moments)
Shiver down my backbone

[Bridge: Noodle & Posdnuos]
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
Plastic on the ceiling
So now lay down to rest
And wait for the mornin' hangover that comes

[Chorus: Posdnuos]
Clocks on the wall
Talk to watches on the wrist
It's the moments we relive
It's the moments like this
When it's time to get ill
We be so ahead of time
It's the moments we achieve
Best believe it's the moments
Moments
Moments
Moments
Moments

[Outro: Ben Mendelsohn]
I'm talkin' about the Kool Klown Klan
Kool Klown Klan
I'm talkin' about the Kool Klown Klan
I need to step out for a fresh of breath air after that
