(feat. Peven Everett)

[Verse 1: Peven Everett]
Momentary pain
Can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change
Magic lantern strange
Are we just too far, to be as one again?
Are we obsidian?
Is this how it is?
Girl, your life will turn
Just like a strobe
'Cause your daddy's vain
And your mother won't
And your heart engages into heartless throes
Are we obsidian?
Is this how it goes?

[Chorus: The Humanz Choir & Peven Everett]
If when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light

[Verse 2: Peven Everett]
Slide the light off you
You may find some peace
All will come to you
If you come with me
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian?
Is this how it ends? (Yeah)

[Chorus: The Humanz Choir & Peven Everett]
If when your private life is dreaming (when your private)
You're living the strobe light (living the strobe light)
And you will find the life you're needing (when your private life is dreaming)
You're living the strobe light (strobe light)

[Bridge: Peven Everett]
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Humanz Choir & Peven Everett]
And when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light (you're living the strobe, when your private life is dreaming)
And you will find the life you're needing (you'll find the life you're needing)
You're living the strobe light
And when your private life is dreaming (when your private life is dreaming)
You're living the strobe light (living the strobe, living the strobe)
And you will find the life you're needing (you will find the life you're needing, yeah)
You're living the strobe light

[Outro: The Humanz Choir & Peven Everett]
Pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
And when you got it
And then you dreaming
(You living the strobe light)
You hit the light
(When your private life is dreaming)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(Like you need it)
(You're living the strobe light)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-ra
(When your private life is dreaming)
And then you're dreaming
(You living the strobe light)
(You living the, living the)
You've got to find it
You know you need it
(You living the strobe light)
