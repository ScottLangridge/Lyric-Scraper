(feat. Anthony Hamilton)

[Intro]
Carnival

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a-

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & Choir]
Just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a-
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & Choir]
We, just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dead, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, just like a-
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival, yeah
