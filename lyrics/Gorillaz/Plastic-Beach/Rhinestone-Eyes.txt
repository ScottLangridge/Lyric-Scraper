I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away

So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet while rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the phoses and growsin
Happy and after native in my soul
I prayed on the unmovable
Yeah clinging to the adam's of rock
Seasons seas just smooth Signs are change
I can't see now she said taxi
I that light is so I can take
Storm bring strange loyalties

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time everyday same routine
Clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Natures' corrupted in factories far away

Your loves' like rhinestones, falling from the sky
With future pixels in factories far away
Your loves' like rhinestones, falling from the sky
With future pixels in factories far away
