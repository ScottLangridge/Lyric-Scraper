It's a sweet sensation over the dock.
I want a situation, but don't wanna stop.
It's the drugs for so boy over the dock,
With the sweetest inspiration, don't wanna stop

Cause it's money, or stuff

It's the money, or stuff
It's the money, or stuff
It's the money, or stuff
It's the money, or stuff
It's the money, or stuff
It's the money, or stuff
