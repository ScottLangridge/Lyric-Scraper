City life
Calling me later
Me and my soul
Geared to attack
Never get another chance
So what you doing
Gotta get money
Ain't quite doing

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Shootin' that life
I'm trying not to laugh now
You won't get money
From doing what you're loving
Moving out of city
Better have a second chance
Kicked a lot of problems
We kicked a lot of them

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

Da da da da da da da da da, da da da da da...... Mmmm hmmmm...

Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness, no no your loneliness
