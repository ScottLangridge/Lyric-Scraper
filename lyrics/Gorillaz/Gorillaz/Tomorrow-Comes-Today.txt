Everybody's here with me
(We) Got no camera to see
Don't think I'm all in this world
The camera won't let me go
The verdict doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go

Yeah yeah yeah
I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

Stereo I want it on
It's taken me far too long
Don't think I'm all in this world
I Don't think I'll be here too long
I Don't think I'll be here too long
I Don't think I'll be here too long

Yeah yeah yeah
I'll pay
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today

(Da da da da da da da da)
