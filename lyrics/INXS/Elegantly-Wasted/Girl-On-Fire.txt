I just landed
Girl on fire
I felt the heat
From sydney to london
Well she shut my mouth
With her repartee
I opened hers
With the rest of me

Girl on fire
Baby burn burn burn
Girl on fire
Baby burn burn burn

Outta the shadows
Comes a dirty song
The same old faces
Try to keep you in line

I saw you laughing
At the very first show
You lit up the city
From the twenty-sixth floor

Girl on fire
Baby burn burn burn
Girl on fire
What's saving her

Baby burn burn burn
Baby burn burn burn
Baby burn burn burn

I just landed
Girl on fire
I felt the heat
From new york to london

Well she shut my mouth
With a repartee
I opened hers
With the things that I say

Girl on fire
That's the heat that burns
Girl on fire
How the flames make you learn

Girl on fire
Baby burn burn burn
Girl on fire
How the flames make me yearn

Girl on fire
Girl on fire
Girl on fire
Girl on girl on

Flames are rising
Flames are rising
Flames are rising
Flames are rising
