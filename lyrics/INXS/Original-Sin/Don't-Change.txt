I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
Even though we fall in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me

I found a love I had lost
It had been gone for too long
Even though we fall in all directions
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me

I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
Even though we fall in all directions
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear

Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me

Don't change
Don't change
