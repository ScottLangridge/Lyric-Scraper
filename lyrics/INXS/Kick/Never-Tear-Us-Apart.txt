Don't ask me what you know is true
Don't have to tell you, I love your precious heart
I, I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collided and they could never tear us apart

We could live for a thousand years but if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly, 'cause we all have wings but some of us don't know why
I was standing, you were there
Two worlds collided and they could never ever tear us apart

I (Don't ask me), I was standing (What you know is true), you were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through) and they could never tear us apart
You (Don't ask me), you were standing (What you know is true), I was there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through) and they could never tear us apart
I, I was standing, you were there, two worlds collided...
