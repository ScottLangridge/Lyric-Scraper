And it comes down to this
When you take a look
Got to find a reason
Find it out
What the funk is about
All you lovers take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they have is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is around
Make the way through the pain
You got no one to blame (No one)
Put a rope around
Push it into the ground
All in the name of love

You get it off again
Kill them all
Blood make's a man
All you lovers take a look around
Before they cut your roses down and down
All they have is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is around
Meet the devil within
And that's a name not a friend name (Name not a friend), that's right
Come around and knocking down doors
And when you let him in, gonna burn again

All you lovers take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they got is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is around
All you lovers take a look around
Before they cut your roses down
All they got is bones and blood
Don't they know that love is not around
