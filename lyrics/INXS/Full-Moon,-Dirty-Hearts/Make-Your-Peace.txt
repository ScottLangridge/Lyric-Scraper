There are rivers running, just for you and me
In the darkest hours, choices made to be
I choose to pull my punches
Don't you test my conscience
You'll see, you'll see
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for

Got a way of getting what I want to see
When you know I'm winning, you'll get over me
All the trash you're thinking, don't you feel it sinking
You'll see, you'll see
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for

All this bitter fighting makes no sense to me
We're only talking circles, we're losing sympathy
No time like the future
Make signs 'cause I need ya
You see, you see
There are rivers running, just for you and me
In the darkest hours, choices made to be
I choose to pull my punches
Don't you test my conscience
You'll see, you'll see
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace, is what you asked for
Cut your teeth and make your peace (It's so sad), is what you asked for (So sad)
Cut your teeth and make your peace (It's so sad), is what you ask for (So sad)
Cut your teeth and make your peace (It's so sad), is what you asked for (So sad)
Cut your teeth and make your peace (It's so sad), is what you asked for
