Oh so fine, we were trying
Out of nowhere, just in time
Let you take me deep down the river
Kiss the changes that shape my life
Always left behind
All the tracks that I could find

All these scars are mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall but I know what's mine
Here we lie looking up to empty sky and the promises we find
I'm not the first one to ask why

All we ever try
I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
Let you take me deep down the river (All the trash)
Kiss the changes that shape my life

All these scars are mine

All these scars are mine

I was thinking, got the feeling
The gift you gave is gonna last forever
All the lies you find (All lies)
All the truth you see (All truth)
Rise and fall (All lies) but I know what's mine (All truth)
I was thinking (All lies), got the feeling (All truth)
The gift you gave (All lies) is gonna last forever (All truth)
All the lies you find (All lies)
All the truth you see (All truth)
Rise and fall (All lies) but I know what's mine (All truth)
I was thinking (All lies), got the feeling (All truth)
The gift you gave (All lies) is gonna last forever (All truth)
All the lies you find (All lies)
All the truth you see (All truth)
Rise and fall (All lies) but I know what's mine (All truth)
