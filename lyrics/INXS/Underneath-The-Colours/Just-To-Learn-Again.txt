Back in time where fear can't climb
Warm and safe with a nursery rhyme
They will put your feet in very hot water
With your senses in a cloud
You make them rich and very proud

All those years of learning
Just to learn again

No talk of love or jungle law
The tender heart we will ignore
And once again and once too often
The misled aims of twisted teachers
Turns your life and face and features

I've come to see your honesty
And ideal plans and security
Softly the voices are speaking to me
Your fault son that you've been done
Now your lessons have just begun
