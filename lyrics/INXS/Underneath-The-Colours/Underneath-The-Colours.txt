No division in the ranks
The lines are long and proud
No question on their lips
But there will always be doubt

Like a chinese painting
All red with it's message
A flag high in the sky
Twists and turns it's language

Underneath the colours red blue white
Catch a glimpse of others
]from the corner of your eye

With the rise and fall
Of the conductor's blind hand
I play russian roulette
I am an angry young man
