Shake make it forever
Curling from your lips
Faith and it's not over
Bring on that famous word
Love don't abuse it
And you'll never be sad again

Chorus
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

Blood's getting hotter
Thinking about your hips
I feel all the hunger
The minute you turn away
I think it's getting better
But I can't wait another day

Chorus

Make all your wishes
No sooner said than done
Here I come like I told you
Whether it's air, land or sea
She said this is the real thing
Cause you're never gonna find the door

Chorus

Love don't abuse it
And you'll never be sad again

Chorus

Love don't abuse it
And you'll never be sad again

Chorus
