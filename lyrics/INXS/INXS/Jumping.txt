Say when you get down
Look to your left
Say when you get up
Look to your right
Figure out the puzzle
Make sure the pieces fit tight

Jumping jumping
All night long
Jump and jump and it's up to you

There is no surefire way baby
It's just the first star you see at night
Don't walk around feeling hazy
If you need a taste take a bite

Some day they'll catch you when you're walking
Don't you put up no fight
Draw back that look of confusion
Say you don't believe in straight lines
