I got a place with a view
You can see the cars
To clubs and bars
As they travel down the freeway
There's a woman downstairs
With matt-grey hair
There's no room for me here
And she smiles when she tells me

They've got it in the country
They've got it in the city
It's all so wishy-washy
But here in the suburbs
I got another place
It's all so wishy-washy
And a woman can come around

This time with a fireplace
But I'm not being fed
Write poetry and feel safe
I said it's good for me now
I said it's good for me now
@ALBUM: _Underneath the Colours_ 1981But I'm not being fed
