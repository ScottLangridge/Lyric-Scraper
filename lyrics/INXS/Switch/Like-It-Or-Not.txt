Sex is sex and
Love is love
Mix em both up
Baby that's the stuff
I can't believe i'm seeing
The world come tumbling, crumbling down
Yeh less love the worlds receiving
More chance of it all shutting down
Shutting down
Yeh yeh
Ooooh oooh like it or not
Ooohh oooh love is the god
Love is the love is the god
Ooooh oooh yeh like it or not
Ooohh oooh love is the god
Love is the god
So put your guns down
On the ground
Yeh peace it makes
Such a pretty sound
I can't believe i'm seeing
The world come tumbling, crumbling down
You won't believe the feeling
When it's all coming back around
Coming round
Yeh yeh
Ooohh oooh love is the god
Ooooh oooh yeh like it or not
Love is the love is the yeh
Ooohh oooh love is my god
