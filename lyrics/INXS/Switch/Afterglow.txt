Here I am
Lost in the moon that comes thru my window
Bathed in blue
The walls of my memories divide the thorns from the roses
It's you and the roses

[Chorus:]
Touch me and I will follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, when I see your eyes
Now I'm living
In your afterglow

Here I am
Lost in the ashes of time
But who wants tomorrow
In between
The longing to hold you again
I'm caught in your shadow
I'm losing control
My mind drifts away
We only have today

[Chorus:]
Touch me and I wil follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Til the blinding day, when I see your eyes
Now I'm Living
In Your Afterglow
(In your afterglow)

And the veils are gone
As I let you go
As I let you go

Touch me and I wil follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Now I'm living
In your afterglow

Bathed in blue
The walls of my memories divides the thorns from the roses
It's you who is closest
