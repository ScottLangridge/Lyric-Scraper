Buy me diamonds and rubies
I'm crazy 'bout bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me
Bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of our favourite things
Buy me diamonds and rubies
I'm crazy bout bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me
Bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of our favourite things
What I need is a gentleman
Who does the best he can
There to hold my hand
I want you to understand
Of course I want diamonds and expensive things
Cause a girl's gotta have her favourite things
Oh, that's what you like nice type of life
Platinum at night flat diamond light
Well that's so bright
You looking right ass kinda tight
Don't spend the night
Roll with the g, oh we could be right you and me
Like fantasy i'll make you real
So what de deal
Girl tell Randy just how you feel
Buy me diamonds and rubies
I'm crazy bout bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me
Bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of our favourite things
I would like a man who would
Take care of business
And still have the time to
Take me on a shopping spree
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine.
With what we have lets put it together and we can shine
I know what you want
And I got what you need
I believe you should be rolling with me
I take you around, out on the town
And show you the way that a boy liquors down
Whenever you're ready girl we can go now
And we can do things you don't even know how
I know that you know that I'm feeling your style
So tell me what you do just to make you go wow uh
Buy me diamonds and rubies
I'm crazy bout bentleys
Gucci dresses and drop top compresses
Wine me and dine me
Bring those platinum rings
Those are a few of our favourite things
Let me tell you what di's is all about
Simplicity easy to please but I like expensive things
For me you can buy diamonds and pearls
Just some of the little things I like in my world
So you like wining and dining and shining
Gliding the riding pushing them hot wicks
Wanna come get with a real pimp
There lots of flaws stuck on it
I'll make you a shopohollic
Buying you stuff untill you vommit
