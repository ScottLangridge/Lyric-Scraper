[Hook:]
Every boy and girl, woman and man
Muthafuck the wagon, come join the band
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Vibrate, vibrate, vibrate, higher!
[Repeat]

Sometimes when it's late at night
And you have no one to talk to
[Verse:]
Here's what you don', you go through that
The Love Below start talkin' to ya
Raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times

Tracy ain't home, Tina ain't home
[Hook:]
[Verse 2:]
Desensitizing the very thing or thang that brought
You into this motherfucker in the first place

The circumcision has already begun
Because Mother Earth is dying and we continue to fuck her to death
And when I say "motherfucker" I do mean "motherfucker"
And yes, God is watching you, but no need to be embarrassed
Play with your own score sheet, become the master of your own..
For the future is in your hands, no the future is in your hand

[Hook]Play with your own score sheet
