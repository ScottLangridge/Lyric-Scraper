D. J. Mrs. Boi:
Outkast...
Tea's long...
Tea's strong...
Lastin' long vs. Long lastin'...
Education, however, the difference between the two...
Which do you live in, yo'self?...
2 draw a master plan without a flaw...
Somethin' lastin' long leaves a compromising position..., everything that isn't becomes questionable..., unbelieveable,... And becomes weak at some point... Done got the strength 2 blow and 2 hit jackin' this joint...
Somethin' long lastin'...
Big Boi & Dre, the duo whose chemistry gave the potion a rare fate, 2 Atlanta boys that came in2 this industry...
For the same ol' boys 2 B Outkast, raps an' Outblast the peers of the game...
Move with the groove an' don't let the smooth groove fool you....
So it is... Believe in the dirty southernplayallisticcaddilac-funky-Atliens,... The kind that makes Aquemini...
Big Boi & Dre presents Outkast...
So get ready 2 bump!...-808-style... 2 "The Speakerboxxx" and "The Love Below",... 2 albums... With the same ol' flow...
Now enjoy it.
Me?
Signin' off... A/K/A... Possum Dre...
