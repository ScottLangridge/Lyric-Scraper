Everybody needs a glass of water today
You know you've got company comin over
To chase the hate away
And everybody needs somebody to love
So you scrub extra-hard
Its too laaaaaaateee oh
Before it's too late
Don't nobody wanna grow old alone!

Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)
And everybody need to quit actin hard and shit
And scratch their dandruff
And everybody needs somebody to love
Love-hater
Its too late

Before it's too late
Love-hater
Hater of love [repeat 2X]
Love-hater
Love-hater
[whispered]

Everybody needs someone to love [repeat 2X]
