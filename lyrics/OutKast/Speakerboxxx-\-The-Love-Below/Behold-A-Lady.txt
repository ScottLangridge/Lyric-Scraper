[Andre 3000]
Sophistofunk, aristocats
Distinguished dawgs, clean up your act
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go
What clubs they hang at?

[Chorus:]
Behold a lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap... You deserve it all [Repeat]
[While it repeats]
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?

[Verse:]
Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
And I need that, hey I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and inadequate
And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You make me smile, you make me... (Hooooo!)
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful

[Chorus:]
[During chorus]
Maybe they disappeared with the dinosaurs,
Oh but that's just the big bang theory,
Maybe they're still around,
But only to be seen with appreciative eyes,
Maybe they were taken for granted,
And lost all their magic,
Oh how awful,
Oh so tragic.

[Verse 2:]
Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely
'Cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The yin to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you don't (But yet you don't) and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do it's profound
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah!
Hoooo! You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown (Aaaaaaahh!)
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like

[Chorus without repeat]
[During Chrous]
So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight
Yes, if you spot one, good sir, treat her right
Benjamin Andre signing off
Thanks a million
Good luck and goodnight

[Chorus 2x]
