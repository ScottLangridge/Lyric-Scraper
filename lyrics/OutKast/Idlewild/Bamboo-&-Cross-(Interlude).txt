The music's starting.
My name is B-A-M-B-O-O.
I'm so fast and everybody is slow.
I'm so strong I can pick anybody up.
I will throw you down and I will give you a pop.

He drools a lot and he's sleeping alot.

You don't kill me like that!
My name is cross
I am the boss.
I'm a visiouse bowler
I wear a polo- with the horse on it.
I'm on it! I'm on it!
And I pop a wheely.
If somebody speeds me I hit 'em!
I can't remember...
Can I dance?
