My TV's staring at me
It says go to sleep, go to sleep'
Turns me into a Siamese twin
Where do i start
The TV screen begins
Plugs me into some holy geek
His point in life is incomplete
My TV is telling me that only money can make me happy
Hold the course and then sail
Hold the course and then sail
Across the satellite beams
Across the oceans or seas
To the lighthouse I could be
I see some soldiers with guns
And they are killing for fun
They are killing to entertain me
Caught between that world and this
I'd sell my soul for a Bond girl's kiss
Caught between that world and this
I'd sell my soul for a state of bliss
My TV's telling me that all our money goes into the military
Hold the course and then sail
Hold the course and then sail
Across the satellite beams
Across the oceans or seas
To the lighthouse I could be
I see some soldiers with guns
And they are killing for fun
They are killing to entertain me
And then I heard your name
As the spaceman came
He came right through my screen
And then his lifeline broke
He began to choke
Jump cut to another scene
Lost a friend to the sea
I lost a friend to the sea
