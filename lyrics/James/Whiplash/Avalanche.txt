Leave the room, don't use the door
We're only on the 13th floor
Your veil is lifting
You've got nothing on, you've nothing on
Every dog must have his day,
Every Caesar should be spade
Your veil is lifting
And we can see right through your suit of tears
You don't own us
Can't control us
Avalanche
Avalanche
Every face a stepping stone
At the top's a throne of bones
Your curtain's twitching
But you can't see past your daily sneer
We don't fear you
Now we see you
Avalanche
Now we got into your shoes
Its your turn to be abused
The heat is rising
And you can't hold back this rage with fear
You accused us
While you used us
Avalanche
You accused us
While you screwed us
Avalanche
