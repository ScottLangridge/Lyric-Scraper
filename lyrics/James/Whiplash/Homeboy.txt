You're a late child
You're a love child
It's enough, child
That you're so appealing
You're appealing, you're appealing
To a need that we all have been feeling
You don't fit where you've been put
They're so straight
Straight out of some book
Try to fake it with the real men
Tried to fill your father's size ten
Alone in this world
You're not a boy or a girl
Don't let them wear you down
What a wonderful ego
You should be so proud
Far out is the life for you
Not just a life, that you must make do
Alone in this world
You're not a boy or a girl
Nothing is certain,
Every things changed
More than just words when you know it's you who's in pain
You hold the chalice, you hold the blade
Bring them together and see what you've made
Facing the future inside a cocoon
Feeling control when you've been so abused
Alone in this world
Your're not a boy or a girl
Alone in this world
You're not a boy or a girl
You're not a boy or a girl
