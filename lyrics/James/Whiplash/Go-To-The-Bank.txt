Baby you're such a tease
With legs that go on forever
Baby come back to me
Maybe we'll get together
Baby come back to me
You're such good company
Baby come back to me
I don't expect you to stay here
I might go shopping just to
I'd go out
Just to buy those things that are eluding me
Just to buy something from the mall
Just to buy something that's eluding me
With a friend or two
With a friend like you
Baby come back to me
You make it look so easy
Why do I have to try so hard
Just to be happy
I feel so empty, so I might go shopping
Just to buy those things that will make me feel
Just to buy those things from the mall
Just to buy those things that would make me feel
Much better
So much better
And I'll call up my sister
For my sister's my teacher
And she might know what I need
'Cos it's not on the telly
And I'll call up my sister
For my sister needs me
And I'll fix her a cup of coffee
And we'll go to the bank
Go to the bank...
It all belongs to Caesar
It all belongs to Caesar...
Go do the bank
Go do the bank
GO TO THE BANK...cont
We're going down to Mexico
To get away from this culture
Go to the bank...
I'm going in
I can receive
I'm going in
I have such dreams
Some love life
Some love life
