Help come when you need it most
Im cured by laughter
Mood swings not sure I can cope
My lifes in plaster (Im past her)
May your wide be wide open
May your heart beet strong
May your minds will be broken
By this heart-felt song

These wounds are all self-omposed
Lifes no disaster, disaster
All roads lead onto death-row
Who knows what's after

May your wide be wide open
May your heart beet strong
May your minds will be broken
By this heart-felt song

May your mind set you free
May your heart lead you on
May your mind let you be (opend by the wonderful)
May your heart lead you on
May your mind set you free (be open by the wonderful)
May your heart lead you on
May you mind be open by the wonderfull
