Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Angel
Your heart hurts here
Your heart hurts here
Your heart hurts here
When you come to me
Don't forget your feelings
I've got nothing you you might need
I'm always bleeding
Oh don't you excite me
And please don't explain
There is no meaning here
Just potential for gain
You've got infinite patience
And the scent of the sea
Love these days when I'm near you
Watering hole, watering hole
Why did you lie to me
Did you lie to me
Why did you say those things
You didn't mean
My heart hurts here
My heart hurts here
What a wonderful fever
I'd had nothing but rain
We just made a decision
It's pain
It's pain
It's pain
I've got nothing to hold you
Got no chest to contain
You're a cave full of treasure
Watering hole, watering hole
