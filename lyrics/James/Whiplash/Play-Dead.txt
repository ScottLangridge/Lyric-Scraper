[music depresses me]
Help's on it's way, I'm lost in space
No protection
Please come and rescue me
I've got no friends, an orphan
Who had faith, who betrayed
Took only a kiss to give me away
Who had faith, who betrayed
Took only a kiss
To blow you away

All in my head
I'll play dead, if you want me to
If you want me all in my head
I'll play dead, if you want me to
If you want me

Who had faith, who betrayed
Took only a kiss to give me away
Who had faith, who betrayed
Took only a kiss
To blow you away

All in my head
I'll play dead, if you want me to
If you want me all in my head
I'll play dead, if you want me to
If you want me
