I see you falling
How long to go till you hirt the ground
You keep on screaming
Don't you see me hear.. am I a ghost to you?

Now your grips to strong
Catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your luck will change tomorrow
Tomorrow

Why are you phoning
What am I to do when you are mile away
You're always calling from the darkest moons
And we're both scared

Now your grips to strong
Catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your love will change

Now your grips to strong
Catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your love will change tomorrow

I'm just out of your range
Tomorrow
All your suffering's in vain
Tomorrow
Lalala

Now your grips to strong
Catch love with a net or a gun
Gotta keep faith that your path will change
Gotta keep faith that your love will change tomorrow

I got out of your range
Tomorrow
All your suffering seems vain
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Some forgiveness now
Tomorrow
Love's no sacred chao
