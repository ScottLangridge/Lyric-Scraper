Blue pastures fade away
Green rivers in silver light
I'm walking to the sound of distant bells
So peaceful I don't know who I am
And just when I think it's clear
It turns all grey again
And I wonder who will find me in the snow
And just when I thought I was free
I got pulled in again
Once you're in, you're in
Blue pastures calling home
I'm Walking but I can't stand anymore
Hear voices, can't tell near or far
Weird voices lay me down
And I don't see why I'm obliged
To just carry on
When everything I touch
Turns out wrong
And I feel I've committed some crime
But I don't know what I've done
One day life just wins
One day life just wins
Still breathing
But I'm tired and I want to go home
Still breathing
But I'm not sure anymore
Still breathing
But it doesn't really matter if I fade away
Fall into sleep
Fall into sleep
