Adore this life, there is no guarantee
Could end by tomorrow
Adore every fight, an opportunity
To give back what was borrowed

Nothing's sacred, make it shatter
Nothing's sacred, fall apart

Oh my heart, oh my heart
Come on, break me in two
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Come on, break me in two

Bring on the dreams, I'm shaking with relief
Don't miss the darker scenes
These roller coaster dreams are breaking my belief
That I should matter

Oh my heart, oh my heart
Come on, break me in two
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Come on, break me in two
Oh my heart, oh my heart
Come on, break me in two

I don't own anything, just this life living me
No control, refugee, just this life, living me
I don't owe anything, just this life, loving me
No control, refugee, just this life, living me

Oh my heart, oh my heart
Come on, break, come on, break
Come on, break, come on, break
Come on, break
