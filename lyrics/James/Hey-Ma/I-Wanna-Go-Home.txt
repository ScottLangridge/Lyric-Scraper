In this bar, in this bar, I am dying
In this bar, in this bar, I am dying

Disassociated, keep off the grass
I prefer you naked, this too shall pass
Nuance carefully weighted, too slow, too fast
Too slow, too fast

I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home

Kissing is forbidden, biting leaves marks
S** is overrated, I need to dance
Calmly understated, well, you always had class
This too shall, hide is amour-plated
Oblivious to darts, this too shall pass

I wanna go home
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now

I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
Right now, right now, right now

I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now

I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, right now
I wanna go home, I wanna go home

In this bar, in this bar, I am dying
In this bar, in this bar, my heart's dying, dying
