No messing with a sense of humor
Will see you through scrapes and all shapes of clouds
We're late, we should have got here sooner
You can't rush fate or question the Dao

We're too thin to wear black
We're no victim to crack
We're too unique to be cloned

What you don't get, you attack
You rely on the laugh track
To get where the punch line explodes
And look who's laughing now

We're laughing out loud, we're laughing
A sound between a cry and scream
We're laughing, laughing out loud

You wrote us off as part time losers
Wielding an axe to hide your self doubt
I don't forgive, I forget

I can't remember which paper
Somebody answer the phone
The phone is ringing now

We're laughing out loud, we're laughing
A sound between a cry and scream
We're laughing, laughing out loud

We're still standing, standing tall
We're still standing
We're laughing, laughing and proud
Come and stand with us or fall, stand or fall

The world is spinning 'round
Spinning 'round, so much faster
And our world is spinning 'round
Spinning 'round, so much faster
