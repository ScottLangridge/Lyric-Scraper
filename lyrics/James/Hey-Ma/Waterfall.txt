My mirror's laughing at me
Says, boy, are you getting old?
There's so much junk in your life
What you've got, you don't even know

Don't take a phone company
To tell you life's pay as you go
I wonder how much of life is set up in utero?

Under the waterfall, under the waterfall
Under the waterfall, it's cool and cold, and clear

Watching too much TV
I'm an actor in a puppet show
There's so much stuff in my life
No room for me to grow

One day I'm going to break from my life
Due south down to Mexico
I'm going to burn down my house
It's the only way to let it go

Under the waterfall, under the waterfall
Under the waterfall, it's cool and cold, and clear

Run your hands 'cross the flanks of a horse
Feel the pulse of blood, feel the heat and the force
It's an antidote to a life spent on the beat

That's the beat of concrete, the beat of machines
Of mobile phones and plasma screens
How much junk in my life do I really need?

Under the waterfall, under the waterfall
Under the waterfall, it's cool and cold, and clear

I'm so cynical, where I need to play?
I'm so cynical, find another way
I'm so cynical, I can't change

One drop is lonely, two drops okay
Three drops can make a spray
Four drops get carried away, dive

Under the waterfall, under the waterfall
Under the waterfall, it's cool and cold, and clear
Under the waterfall, under the waterfall
Under the waterfall, it's cool and cold, and clear
