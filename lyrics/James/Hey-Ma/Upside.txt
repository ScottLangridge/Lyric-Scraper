Send seasonal greetings from nowhere
I'm working and playing away
Remember the moment of leaving
Yesterday, yesterday

Roll through these towns, over seas, over mountains
Lucky to work when work is scarce
Father must feed, must provide, he must fountain
Left my heart within your care

Upside, love you, downside, miss you
I'm here, you are there
Upside, working, downside, hurting
Hear my echo, dancing bear

Connected to you by a mobile
What I can't do, I can say
Away from you, I'm feeling empty
I am raining, I am gray

Upside, love you, downside, miss you
I'm here, you are there
Upside, working, downside, hurting
Hear my echo, dancing bear

My work's about words and sounds you can taste
Violins and trumpets, chocolate cakes
Here are some words, words you can taste
Here are some words, kissing your face

Upside, love you, downside, miss you
I'm here, you are there
Upside, working, downside, hurting
Hear my echo, dancing bear
