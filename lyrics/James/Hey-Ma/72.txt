You're going to murder in the name of God
What kind of God you dreaming of?
A God of blood not love

So, you can get your 72
Virgins to abuse
I hope they kick like mules

War, war

My God's bigger than your God
He made the world run out of puff
More important things to do

War, war

It's black, it's white, a fight
An elephant gray
There's this universe at stake
We get in the way

Go left, go right, straight on
Just do what they say
There's a universe at stake
We get in the way

It's black, it's white, a fight
An elephant gray
There's a universe at stake
We get in the way

Go left, go right, straight on
  (War)
Just do what they say
There's a universe at stake
  (War)
We get in the way

War, war, war, war
