Tiptoe behind sapper
Who crawls through the minefield
Knife in the soil, and his ear to the ground
Hiding in shadow, he takes the risks
You are the pimp who steals the sound

Fox breathes again, when the fox breathes again

When you spy a fresh face remember the rich taste
You want a part, at the cost of it all, so you open your flick knife
And lop off a thick slice
Envy makes the flyer fall

Please don't hitch a ride with us, you leave a slime that turns to pus
Your appetite is out of sight
I think I'll be feeding you dynamite

Please don't hitch a ride with us, you leave a slime that turns to pus
Your appetite is out of sight
I think I'll be feeding you dynamite

I'll never feed you again

When you spy a fresh face, remember the rich taste
You want a part at the cost of it all, so you open your flick knife
And lop off a thick slice
Envy makes the flyer fall

The only way to kill this breed is stuff it's face, let him feed
Piling the plate, pushing the load, make him eat 'til he explodes

The only way to kill this breed is stuff it's face, let him feed
Piling the plate, pushing the load, make him eat 'til he explodes

I'll never feed you again
