Hello
Swig from the bottle, now who's sucking who
You'd prefer the nipple, but your teeth have cut through
Defects we're born with, but poisons we choose
He' s not there, just a gap in the air
He's not there, just the smell of despair
He's not there
Pill-popping and a pint-pulling
And a thirst-quenching, mind-bending
Pill-popping and a pint-pulling
And a thirst-quenching, mind-bending
Pill-popping and a knife-pulling
People come knocking, but there's no one at home
Did you get my call, oh you haven't a phone
That look in your eyes, it's miles away
Don't look in your eyes, you are miles away
He's not there he's really not there
Oh, people come knocking but there's no one at home
Did you get my call, oh you haven't a phone
That look in your eyes, it's miles away
That look in your eyes, it's miles away
He's not there he's really not there
