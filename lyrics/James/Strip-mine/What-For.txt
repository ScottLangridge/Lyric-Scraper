Today, I won't think of any sad things
Will not think of torture, or the rape of nature
Just today, I won't touch those sickening papers
Will just let myself get swept away by this beautiful day

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

The sunset tonight is beyond all words, in the sky above the square
The starling spiral dancing on air.

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

I will pass through the glass into air past those birds
In the square, I am sun, I am sky in my mind's eye

Today, I will dive into foaming seas
Sick fish, myself, and some strange debris.
I would prefer to be anywhere away from here
Oh I would prefer to be anywhere away from here
I would prefer to be anywhere away from here
I would prefer to be anywhere away from here

What for, tell oh me tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

I will pass through the glass into air past those birds
In the square I am sun I am sky

What for, tell oh me tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for
