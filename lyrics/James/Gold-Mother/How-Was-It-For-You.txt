Well they said you are as good as you look but that
Would be impossible
For you look even better than the face of God on a sunny day
You look good enough to eat but I've had a bellyful
And now I have this bill but I don't wanna pay
How was it for you
Do you really need that drink to disarm defences
Can you ever face the flak when you're in control
Well I don't believe my luck I am defenceless
Do with me what you want but don't tell a soul
Don't tell my soul
How was it for you
If you ain't out of your head can you ever enjoy yourself
But if you ain't in your head then who's at home?
I'm so possessed by s** I could destroy my health
We could be dancing over coals and we'd never know
We'd never know
How was it for you
Where did you get those clothes
Are you sure they're still fashionable?
The sell by date says 68
Where did you steal those riffs and that bad attitude
You are traveling back in time to an altered state
How was it for you
Was it as good as it was for me
Well that's the best it's ever been
And you're the best I've ever seen
How was it for you
How was it for you?
