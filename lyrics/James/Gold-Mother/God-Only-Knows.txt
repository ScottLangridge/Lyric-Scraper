You may say I am cynical, but I say man is flawed
He has a vague memory of before some fall
Behaving like a reptile, but talks of walking tall
If God is in his image, the almighty must be small

God only knows

Swaggart has been caught with his trousers round his knees
After damning me and you to hell for eternity
S** and power and money is the prayer of these priests
They bribe their way past heaven's gates and steal a set of keys

God only knows my guru has been sleeping with adepts and with sheep
While I was fucking celibate, self-righteous in belief
Yesterday he was god, now he is a creep
We fell upon each other starving for relief

God only knows

I damn you all to hell
I speak in the name of god
I know him intimately
I speak in the name of the white haired old man in the clouds
Always a man
Dispensing lightening justice from his fingertips
As self-righteous and bigoted as those who created him
A cruel desert God with absolutely no sense of humor
How do you feel old man?
How do you feel?
Being spoken for by these self-righteous fanatics
Is heaven full, oh lord, of these babbling preachers and
God-fearing biggots
Well I know where I'd rather be
Away from this cacophony
God only knows
God only knows
God only knows
