Chocolate. Kisses. Pokemon
Hit em while they're young
It's true - ahha
She needs lovers round the block
He works around the clock
It's true - ahha
I know it's gonna make it better
Just know it's gonna make it better
We can hold the light of grace
Instead we flake and choose to lose

T. V. Football. S** and killing
Without love, life's not worth living
Ahha
We play our games with knowing smiles
Unattached we can choose
We choose to lose it everytime

Now were heading for a fall
And a double takes it all
A stranger rolls a double 5
And everyone's a junkie
Everyone's a junkie
Everyone's a junkie
Everyone's a junkie

I know it's gonna make it better
Just know it's gonna make it better

I'm so wound up in my own ball
I loved my life so small
I've lived my life so small
I've done my best it's time to crawl
Sideways
To crawl sideways
To leave this apparition
To leave this apparition doll
Cos everyone's a junkie
Everyone's a junkie
Everyone's a junkie
