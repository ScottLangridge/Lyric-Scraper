I'm a boomerang
In the outback
Keep your throwing arm steady
So I get home
I'm a vampire bat
Out in shanghai
Haven't eaten in four days
I've ordered in a chinese takeaway

I show more than I hide
I care more than I cry
I'm a phonograph baby
My wires are live
And I'm in crisscross

Fine. I feel fine.

I'm a fortune cookie
Full of cheap advice
I'm a suicide rookie
Blowing last call

Show more than I hide
Care more than I can cry
I'm a phonograph baby
My wires are live
And I'm in crisscross

Fine. I feel fine.
