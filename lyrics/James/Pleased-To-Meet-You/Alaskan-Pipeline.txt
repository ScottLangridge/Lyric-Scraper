You might as well surrender now
You'll never hold that stance
With all my words
I can't find one
To make you understand
It's not too late
Take up the cup
Put down your weapons and choose
But you say, " life's so unfair"
All you say is "life's so unfair."
Oh you can I'll afford to hold to these views
Oh you need something to blame
But it's you, yes it's you
It's your truth

Someone made you
I don't know if you're sick
I comfort. You runaway
My sympathy. You twist it.
You're reflex. Gets in the way.
You mother me. I son you.
You act up. I can't get through.
These footsteps so ancient.
In your eyes I'm your infant.
Your ancient. Full circle.
In my eyes you're my infant.
Dead ball in our court
We've got a deadfall in our court

You just say, "life's so unfair."
You just say, "life's so unfair."
You need something to blame
But it's you, yes it's you
It's your truth
