Break my shape - in light I trust
None exist - save space and dust
None exist - just lights in time
Space divides the borderline

Don't exist just lights in time
Space divides the changing line
Space between and space inside
My four walls my shape defines
Space defines

You'd better get over yourself
You gotta get out of the frame
Gotta learn to see yourself
A total stranger
You gotta get out of the frame
Gotta give yourself a brand new name
Gotta learn to see yourself
A total stranger

It's a shock to my system
To wind up back where I have come from
It's a crime in my child's eyes
To find out life is in disguise

You'd better get over yourself
You gotta get out of the frame
Gotta learn to see yourself a total stranger
You gotta get out of the frame
Gotta give yourself a brand new name
Gotta learn to see yourself
A total stranger

It's a shock to my system,
To wind up back,
Where I have come from.
It's a crime ,in my child's eyes,
To find out life,
Is in disguise

It's a shock to my system,
To wind up back, where I have come from
It's a crime,
To my child's eyes,
To find lifes' in disguise
Oh no , it's gone
It's gone, nothing to hold me
Oh no , it's gone it's gone
Nothing to hold me

Calling ,calling, calling you to see through me
