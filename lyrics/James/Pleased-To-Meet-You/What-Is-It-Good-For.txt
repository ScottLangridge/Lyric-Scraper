I've been a fool again
Won't let it show
I've been a fool again
Don't let it, don't let it grow

Hold my heart I can't feel
Hold my heart I can't feel

Now I have stolen poison fruit
It makes me weak
And my baby's gonna leave me for some creep
But if you work your miracle,
Work your miracle
I can see
If you work your miracle,
Work your miracle
I can see
Cos my baby's gonna leave me for some thief
For baby she is hard
To deceive

I've been a fool again
Don't let it grow
Hold my heart I can't feel
Hold my heart only when I bleed
Broken it's all broken
What is it good for
What is it good for
Broken
Don't know what's good for me
Don't know what's good for me
But if you work your miracle
Work your miracle I can see
If you work your miracle
Work your miracle I can seeeeeeeeeee
