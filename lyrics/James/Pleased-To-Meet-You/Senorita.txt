I've been shot
In the wherewithalls
And I don't think I can stop
From all this hullabaloo

Mary jane's
On the game again
Seratonin's all I use
I just wish it were true

Don't treat me like a god
Treat me like a dog
I'll come home to you
To you

I'm addicted to you
You're my love my senorita
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna pull through
I'm addicted to you
You're the love that makes me younger
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna pull through
Pull through

Sing a prayer
Lonely nights are here
If I can't square my fears
With what I want to do

Don't treat me like a god
Treat me like a dog
I'll be good to you
To you

I'm addicted to you
You're my love my senorita
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna pull through
I'm addicted to you
You're the God that makes me stronger
I'm addicted to you
Hope were gonna turn blue
Turn blue
