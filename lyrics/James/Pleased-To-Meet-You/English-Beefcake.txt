I wish that I could make myself

A cool machine designed to help

Not always hurting

Just plug me in and do the rounds

Impress your friends

Save yourself pounds

I'll not be wanting

I wish that things could be that way

But every dog must have it's day

The orchestra's tuning

I understand your suffering

I felt the same sting in my heart

That's why I'm singing

Drifting away as lovers do

Heads you win and tails I lose

Nothing to say

Much less to do

Unhappy me unhappy you

I know you want it all to end

Transform a love into a friend

Magicians can do

Gut feelings come

Gut feelings go

Like rivers we have no control

They just keep flowing

Yeah, I wish I could create myself

A cool machine or someone else

A lot less knowing

Drifting away as lovers do

Heads you win

And tails I lose

Nothing to say

Much less to do

Unhappy me

Unhappy you

Love can heal

And love can sting

Heads you lose

And tails I win

Unhappy me

Unhappy you

Nothing to say

And much less to do

There's nothing to say

I get in the way

Unable to break obsession

There's nothing to say

I get in the way

Still unable to break obsession
