Which scarecrow has the power of voice
It will stab you in the thigh
And when she wails, it twists your insides

Wise scarecrow
Which scarecrow
Which scarecrow

A pitch for which she has been searching
Holds the key to the dreams she's been dreaming

(refrain)
Coming on, coming on, coming on
She's coming on strong
She's coming on coming on coming on coming on
Coming on strong

Droll,
Try to mix her ego with her soul
Never mix the ego with the soul
I always twist my ego with my soul

Which scarecrow
Wise scarecrow
Which scarecrow

And 'cause you was her inspiration
Got a plan that could shatter a nation

(refrain)
When your song strikes me
My walls fall down
And I can sit down
In your perfect light and sound
