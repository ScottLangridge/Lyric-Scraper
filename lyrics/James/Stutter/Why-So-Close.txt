Why so close
Big boys in black hats
Cowboys with white guns
White guns shoot blue white
Blue white baptism
No buffaloes
No indians
No more buffaloes

Red sky is falling
Blue blood no stalling
White heat will strip you
No time to run far

(refrain 1)
Ivan's built a wall of lead 'round his house
Nobody can get in or out
Running out of food for ammunition
Frightened of the darkness
Sending out scouts

Why hang the fire so close
Why hang the fire so close
Why hang the fire so close
Why so close

(refrain 2)
Wayne's got a wall that's much more subtle
Wore headphones since he was born
Watches ivan through dark glasses
Hand on his gun waiting for the storm

One false move and we all fall down
No funeral games, no such fun
Here's your ticket to the party
That's what you get for playing with a gun

Six-gun so close

(refrain 1)
Ivan's got a wall of lead 'round his house
Nobody can get in or out
Running out of food for ammunition
Frightened of the darkness
Sending out scouts

(refrain 2)
Wayne's got a wall that's much more subtle
Wore headphones since he was born
Watches ivan through dark glasses
Hands on his gun waiting for the storm

Why stand the fire so close (why)
Why stand the fire so close (why)
Why stand the fire so close (why)
Why?
