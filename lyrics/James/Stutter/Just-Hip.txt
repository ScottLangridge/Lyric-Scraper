An emotional charge like an electrical spark
But the fuses are two, you can't tell them apart
When the bodies collide, the bodies emerge back into one
The only urge all change, all change etc.
Change your paths

But you can't help the thought that when nothing stays still
The tiger moves on when it's taken it's fill
But you cling to the part like a shark to it's prey
When the part doesn't last there's pain, but no one to blame who's to blame?
Fail to achieve a basis for collaboration
Fail to achieve a basis for collaboration
But you cling to the part like a shark to it's prey
The preacher looked out on my doing today
And he said, "oh, this looks curly to me."
