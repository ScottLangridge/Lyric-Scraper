Down the chute and out the door
I know that I've been here before
The blinding lights, the long white coat
Cut the cord before I choke
Oh, please sir, handle me gently
I've got nothing to protect me
This man in a mask stabbed me in the back
No sooner alive than I'm being attacked
If this is the planet Earth
Oh please, mom, take me back in your sack
My keepers aren't too bad this time
The man's quiet, the woman's crying
When I arrive, what's hers is mine
I take and take it all the time
Oh please sir, do not tempt me
Those sweet things, they just destroy me
I always want more than I can get
My belly's full, but I'm not done yet
Need something to kill
The word is you. Mine
It's true, it's true, it's true
You taught us how to be the same as you
If only you really knew
We wouldn't do what you do
It's true
As you poison the Earth you poison our lives
This isn't living, but another disguise
Go looking for truth
As all of this is built on lies and lies etc.
Hey, hey, hey now you've found me
Everything's so clear
With your arms around and your song in my heart
There's simply nothing I can fear
Feel he inside burst through my head
Replacing my eyes
Please don't let me hide
Cut through my head
Replacing my eyes
