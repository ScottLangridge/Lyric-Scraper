Withdrawn, muscles all tense
Nothing flows for the self-obsessed
Feel all washed up

Restless, can't sit still
A mental state, or a physical ill
Toxic, bones all cracked
Step on a bus, get a panic attack

Of that you took me so high
Now getting out of bed is enough to make me cry
Saps all my energy
That's how it used to be
You came just in time

Feel all washed up
Need a wash up
Need a wash

Restless, muscles all ache
So tense, watch me shiver as you shake
Not a dance but a scream by the body at the stake
Pierces my heart, something's gonna break

Amazed when you cannot deny
Going out of bed is enough to make you cry
That's how it used to be before you came by

Screwed up at school
Hate bad food
Too many T. V. Views live in you (my friend)

Feel all washed up (need a wash)
Much to take, I'm overcome
So wash me up with a loving song
