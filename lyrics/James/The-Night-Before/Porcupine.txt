Knock Knock Knock
My house is always open
Why shield myself with
Quills and feints and lies
I can put on quite a show
But inside I'm broken
Porcupine
Porcupine

Here it comes again

Please don't stop
You'll get past my defenses
My body armour's plated over time
I got away with it once
But I soon became addicted
Porcupine porcupine

At the edge of the world
Leave my things by the door
I surrender control
Diving into the fall

On my back's the weight
Of my offences
You're a skunk and
I'm a porcupine
Our weaponary's evolved
From the heightened senses
Porcupine
Porcupine

At the edge of the world
Leave my things by the door
I surrender control
Diving into the fall
