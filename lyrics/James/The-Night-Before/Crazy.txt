This magic world, this magic world
This magic world, it inspires

With the faith that I was born with
In my schooling in the forges
Time has lost it's power to do it's worst
But I don't mean to bore you
With the details of my story
Can't help myself, help myself I conspire

This magic world, this magic world
This magic world, it inspires

I'm not crazy I'm just laughing at myself
I can look so strong yet feel so insecure
I'm not crazy I'm just laughing at myself
Even when I look so strong I feel so small

This is the face that I was born with
In a race I can't keep up with
Seperate the stardust from the dirt
But I don't mean to bore you
With the details of my story
Can't help myself help myself I'm a liar

But I'm not crazy I'm just laughing at myself
I can look so strong and yet feel so insecure
No I'm not crazy I'm just laughing at myself
Even when I look so strong I feel so small
No I'm not crazy I'm just laughing at myself
I don't know if I'm the poison or the cure
