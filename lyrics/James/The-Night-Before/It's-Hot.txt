It's hot enough
Within this bed (to try an egg)
To melt our differences

A leap of faith

This fiery love
Dissolves the edge
Creates a bridge

A leap of faith

It's hot inside the chrysalis
As cells create (divide)
A dreamy (creamy) bliss
A leap of faith
And out of this
A floating kiss
Life loves, to exist

Hangover after the party
Hangover after the party
