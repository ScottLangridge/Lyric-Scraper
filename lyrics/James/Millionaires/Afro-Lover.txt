Everybody wants to be happy
Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants more loving
Everybody wants the same thing

I came across the border through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches was patrolled by the deaf and the blind
The blind were shouting 'listen!'
While the deaf said 'can't you see? '
Somewhere deep in no man's land some man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting so I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it 'freedom' so my enemy bought a bigger one
I'm saving up for a missile that will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button and my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic in this mystery
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

Everybody wants to be happy
Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants the same thing
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

I have seen
I have seen
I have seen
