So you thought we were over
Surprise, surprise
We're not going anywhere

So fell on your sword again
Tell me what the views like
Deep down in your carpet

You were straight, you were straight now you're twisted
You're right, you're right
Burn the joint to leave the waking

(hello, surprise)
Don't you turn, turn out your light
(hello, surprise)
Surprise, surprise

(hello, surprise)
Don't you turn your day into night
(hello, surprise)
Surprise, surprise

We all prayed, we all prayed you'd rise again
From the hard shoulder
What the doctor ordered

Gotta fix, gotta fix what's not broken
All broke, all broke, I'm busted
Hey twenty one and overs

(hello, surprise)
Don't you turn, turn out your light
(hello, surprise)
Surprise, surprise

(hello, surprise)
Don't you turn, your day into night
(hello, surprise)
Surprise, surprise
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied

Falling backwards into darkness
Loving, reckless, hiding distress
I've got a message for you
You're the one who makes it come true

(hello, surprise)
Don't you turn, turn out your light
(hello, surprise)
Surprise, surprise

(hello, surprise)
Don't you turn, your day into night
(hello, surprise)
Surprise, surprise
Still not satisfied
(hello, surprise)
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
(hello, surprise)
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
Still not satisfied
