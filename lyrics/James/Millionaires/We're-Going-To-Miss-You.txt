This is not, this is not, a song
This is a shield, this is a charm, with your name on
By this beat, by this verse, I'm protected
From your heat, and your curse, is reflected
If anybody hurts me
If anybody hurts me

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone

Your green eyes, poison pen, serpent's tongue
Will return to the source that they came from
Revenge is the wine
Forgiveness is fine
Forgiveness divine
Revenge is more human

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone

No words, all's been said and done
No more words, all's been said and done

Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone
Here's a mirror with your name on
Singing we're gonna miss you when you're gone
