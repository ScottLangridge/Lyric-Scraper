Before you, no direction
Before i, came on in
Before you, let your doubts down
The wall, we're closing in
We're closing in

Adore you, no protection
Ignore you, it can't be done
To make do, with a safer option
A breakthrough, two to one
Two to one

And I hope I'm not shooting my mouth off
Again
And I pray I'm not tempting the fates
When I say we can go on forever
It's a date
It's a date

(here she comes)
Yes I know that I love to seem foolish
(here she comes)
Like now
Yes I know that love hardly lasts
(here she comes)
(here she comes)
And it's hard to receive that we're happy
(here she comes)
Here's my heart
Here's my heart

Here she comes
