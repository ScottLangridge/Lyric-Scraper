Someone's got it in for me
I don't want your sympathy
Life just never turned out how I wanted it to
Could have been a shooting star
Should have made it past the bar
Would have been a winner if I ever got that far

What a state I'm in
My self-pitying
Here's another victim
Singing suffering

If only I had made the grade
Been more loved, been less afraid
I only I had scored the goal
Got the girl, or even played

What a state I'm in
My self-pitying
Here's another victim
Singing suffering

Fall, let it fall away to be born again
And oh... Let it fall away
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again

My life's turned to minor chords
Lose a son and life's a bore
Can't see the point in living in the fashion anymore

What a state I'm in
My self-pitying
Here's another victim
Selling suffering

Fall, let it fall away to be born again
And oh... Let it fall away
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again
