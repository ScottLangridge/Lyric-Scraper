A diva, a leaver, a lawyer, imagine, imagine
A fever, a vision, derision, imagine, imagine
Someone got hurt
Someone got high
Someone got left behind the lies
Someone got hurt
Someone got high
Some of them left the rest behind

All of your mail is unaddressed
Cut the herman free from the hesse
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash,

A letter, a photo, etcetera, etcetera, a judas
A hotel, a motel, a motive, imagine, imagine
Someone got hurt
Someone got high
Someone got left behind the lies
Someone got hurt
Someone got high
Some of them left the rest behind

All of your mail is unaddressed
Ut the herman free from the hesse
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash,

This is hell
This is hell
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash,
Crash, crash, crash
