You and me
Play this song, the vision
Hope to make this love stretch forever
Don't let go in this now or never
Hope there's change enough to say...

Hello
It's over
Hello
It's over
Hello
It's over

Hello

You must say what you're thinking
I'm no mind reader of the stars
We won't get any older
It's so fleeting
I am lost when I'm torn from your heart

Hello
It's over
Hello
It's over
Hello
Hello

Somebody dreams a brave new world
I'm forbidden to breathe it's pearl
Late summer evening
Late summer scene
Come together to make this dream

Hello
It's over
Hello
It's over
Hello
Hello
It's over

All but the sea
All but the sea
