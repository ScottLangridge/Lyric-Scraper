Here she comes with a gun in her hand
A look in her eyes, says you don't understand
And the moon is full, what are you gonna do
A gun in her hand makes her feel like a man
Ohh

Her man is a monkey we've all agreed
This woman's a saint, or at least she's a queen
But if you mess with this angel, the harpy arrives
Talon and wings and a cute 45

He's only human, only male
Bound to stray, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
Nothing can hold him, not even a ring

She's only human, only female
Bound to victim, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
She's only acting on the rite of spring

Here she comes with a gun in her hand
A look in her eyes says she don't understand
And the womb is full what are you gonna do
A gun in her hand makes her feel like a man
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
