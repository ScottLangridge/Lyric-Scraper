Drifting through the atmosphere
Through the afterglow
Witnessing one thousand lies
I'll blow, where the wind blows
Falling in between the lines
Never fitting in
Someone tells me what's my crime
Too thin
I'm too thin
Due to come back down due to come back down
Don't wanna, don't wanna land
Due to come back down, due to come back down
I don't wanna, don't wanna land
Don't wanna, don't wanna, land
Land
Land
This time I've a staring role
Hide the shape I'm in
I'm too old to sacrifice for gold, and skin
For gold
And skin
For gold
For gold
I don't want to come back down, don't want to land
Down, don't want to come down, down don't want to land
Down, don't want to come down, down don't want to land
Down, don't want to come down, down don't want to land
Drifting through the atmosphere
Floating through this land
Sifting through one thousand years
Of sand
All sand
Drifting through the atmosphere
Floating through this land
Sifting through one thousand years
Of sand
All sand
Drifting through the atmosphere
Floating through this land
Sifting through one thousand years
Of sand
All sand
Drifting through the atmosphere
