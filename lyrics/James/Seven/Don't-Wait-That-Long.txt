Operator the lines are down
And I'm a traitor
A traitor to a beautiful cause
God made me to her own design
Bad planing
Too many floors
How long will it take to get used to me?
How long will it take to get used to me?
Don't wait that long
Won't wait that long
Don't wait that long
Don't wait that long
Oh yes I love
But today I could hate you
I could hurt you
Cause we're joined at the heart
Beats faster, hits harder
Than a boxer
Whenever we are apart
Body language is an SOS
I don't understand how our fights start
Not enough
Too believe in love
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where we've gone wrong
How long will it take to get used to me?
How long will it take to get used to me?
Don't wait that long
Won't wait that long
No we won't wait that long
Don't wait that long
Operator
The lines are down
And I'm a traitor
To a beautiful cause
God made me
To her
Own design
Bad planning
Too many floors
I've got too many floors
Too many floors
Don't wait that long
Won't wait that long
No we won't wait that long
