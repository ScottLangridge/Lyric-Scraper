There's a fight, there's a fight, there's a fight
And the rage is growin'
You have pushed me through too many windows and too many doors
You have torn all the joy from my heart and my body shows it
The only beats you allow around here are the beat of war
Let's have a party
Bring a gun
Bring a gun
Don't go out with that smile tonight or you might get arrested
Get a license for that grin or they'll lock you away
If you show that you're happy inside then you're gonna get busted
The only law we allow around here is an organized raid
Let's have a party
Bring a gun
Bring a gun
What are you gonna do when the muscle wont move when they are lockin you up
Blockin the light
How many words will you waste on the telephone
What are you gonna do when the muscle wont move when they are lockin you up
How many words will you waste on the telephone
Lets lets lets
Have a party
And you can bring your gun
And you can bring your shinny new helicopter
Bring a gun
Bring a gun
Lets have a party
Bring your gun
