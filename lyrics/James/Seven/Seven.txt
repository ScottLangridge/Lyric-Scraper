Blow me away
Was that love you declared
Only a word love can mean anything
Understand the world we're livin in
Oceans apart
What's that view from your way
Beautiful craft
Weather can change
Understand the world were living in
Love can mean anything
God made love to me
Soothed away my gravity
Gave me a pair of angels wing
Clear vision and some magic things
God is love love to me
Thank you for those things
Understand the world were living in
Love can mean anything
Darling I'm open
And darling I'm broken
Now we don't have time
Let you drift away
Like a heavy cloud
With the weight of rain
Understand the world were living in
Love can mean anything
Understand the world were living in
Love can mean anything
Understand the world were living in
Love can mean anything
Understand the world were living in
Love can change anything
