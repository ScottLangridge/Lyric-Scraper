I don't believe Jesus was a human being
I've never met a propheit who's sheets are clean
Only in a film could he be so cool
But only in life could fathers be so cruel
What in the world are you dreamin' of
To sacrafice the son you love
You send your children off to war
As if you care!
As if you care!
To live the love of life
To live your love of life
To live your love of life
Your love of life
Your love of life
Draft it, hop in, sacrafice for common good
What we want
Sucks it out
With what we sould
All of these commercials are jsut teasing me
Everybody's restless with a deeper mean
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The system to crush enemies
A savior nailed to every tree
As if you care
As if you care
The propheit said
The propheit said
To live the love of life
To live your love of life
To live your love of life
Your love of life
Your love of life
Where's your love of life
The propheit said
The propheit said
Where's your love of life
Show me your love of life
Show me your love of life
To sacrafice the son you love
You send your children off to war
As if you care
As if you care
