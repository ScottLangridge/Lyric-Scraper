I'm leaking down the left side
Oh God no, I hope it doesn't show
But somebody's getting a mouth full of the emperor's new clothes.
I'm leaking down the left side
No one can see my gallbladder's burst and so has my spleen.
Leg and an arm and a leg and a arm...
I'm leaking down the left side
Oh God no, I hope it doesn't show.
I'm so wound up my bowels just want to blow.
I hope you don't think I'm a jerk
Though nothing I do ever seems to work.
My timing of that joke was wrong.
You can't call that a dance or this a song.
You can't call this a song.
You can't call this a song.
You can't call this a song.
Found my way through this attack.
Hope no one sees through my act.
All those people staring at me.
Their piercing gazes make me want to scream.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

Leg and an arm leg and an arm...
Oh, fill holy hole
Oh, fill my holy hole
Oh, fill my holes.
Oh, fill my holes.
Oh, fill my holes.
Oh, fill my holes.
Feel my holes.
Feel my holes.
I couldn't plug my holy holes.
I couldn't plug my holes.
I couldn't plug my holes.
