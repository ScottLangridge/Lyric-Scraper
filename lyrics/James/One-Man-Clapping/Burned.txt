If you don't look cool
They won't look at you
But if you image is strong
Any song will do
They'll think that the wrapping's the gift
Is a throw away stone
All we want
Is an empty throne

I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned

But I won't let it show
I won't let it show
I won't let it show
I won't let it show
I won't let it show
My belief's are all shaken
I'm lost in grief at the state I'm in
Seen too much goodness chewed up by money men
If God exists she should make us king

I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned

What must we do to make money
Sell our dreams to some pharisee
Believe that all everyone wants is power and fame
If you won't get screwed, don't go on the game

I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
I feel I've been burned
Burned
Burned
Burned...
I've been burned
I've been burned
I've been burned...
