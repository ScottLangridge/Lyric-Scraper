High voice, deep inside
Witness what you think you hide
I will race you through emotions
If you let me in
I made an armour plated suit
You put your lips to helmet slits
Try to suck me out the tin
I can't get out, I'm welded in

I'd run away, to brave for tears
Or sitting still to see
What lives behind the enemy lines
When you have torn away the screen

High voice, deep inside
Witness what you think you hide
I will race you through emotions

If you let me in
That body's naked as the mind
The bruises mark the site of blows
Inside my suit my body's fine
When I last looked like mine

I'd run away, to brave for tears
Or sitting still to see
What lives behind the enemy lines
When you have torn away the screen

I'm going deeper and deeper in debt
Deeper and deeper in debt
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper in debt

I'm not the only one in chains
I hear you creaking when it rains
Under pressure, under stress
I see you through your holy vest
That body's naked as you mind
When I last looked, it looked like mine

Oh look at the chain mail and his body guard
Look at the chain mail and his shoddy body guard
Look at the chain mail and his body guard
Chain mail
Chain mail
Chain mail
Chain mail

I'd run away
Brave for tears
And sitting still to see
What lives behind
The enemy lines
When you have torn away
When you have torn away
When you have ripped away the screen
