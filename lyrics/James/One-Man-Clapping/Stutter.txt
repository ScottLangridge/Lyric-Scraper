Tongue split
In the night
I woke up in blood
Red sheets
Wrapped tight
Dreamt I was drowning in mud
Now there's a beast in my mouth
It's out of control
Beats with will of it's own
Broken my teeth withdraw my gums
I think that it's taken control
Spits out your emotion
Left a deep impression
Expression
Expression, makes me feel more expression
Life changed
That night
As rip chord took command
Spit balls
All the abuse
Were more than friends could stand
Now I don't think before I speak
I open my mouth to see
What comes out
A whisper or a shout
Some sanity or a scream
Spits out raw emotion
Looking for a deeper expression
Expression
Expression
Expression
Expression, makes me feel more... expression

That be me says it all
That be me has it all

Expression
Expression
