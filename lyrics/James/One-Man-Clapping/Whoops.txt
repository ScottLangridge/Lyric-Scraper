Oh lord I tried I have tried so damn hard to fit in
I've worn away my edges
And I'm looking mighty thin
Whoops-a-daisy don't trip that wire
Whoops-a-daisy don't touch that wire
Whoops-a-daisy
Whoops-a-daisy
Whoops

I know all your soft spots
They're the same soft spots that are in me
If you keep on scratching
They will flare up suddenly

Whoops-a-daisy don't touch that wire
Whoops-a-daisy don't touch that wire
Whoops-a-daisy
Whoops-a-daisy
Whoops
Whoops
Whoops-a-daisy
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoops

Don't touch that wire
Don't touch that wire
Don't touch that wire
Don't touch that wire
Don't touch that wire
