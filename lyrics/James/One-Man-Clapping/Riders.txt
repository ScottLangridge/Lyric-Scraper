I'm in a crowded room
I've been half asleep
Says the sister in uniform
Has everybody understood?
The listeners turn and nod
But I can see their fear, do they know more than me
Do they know why they're here

I don't want that poison in
I don't want that poison in
I don't want that poison in
Poison in

She passed around a potion
It went from lip to hand
I took a sip
A taste I didn't understand

The woman then explained that this was the juice
The juice that causes pain
That all great singers need

I don't want that poison in
I don't want that poison in
I don't want that poison in
Poison in

I stumbled from the room
There must be some mistake
I do not want this seed
I think I'm in anothers dream

But I can feel this creature flapping in my throat
I try and throw it up
But my cough turns to a choke

Put my fingers in my mouth
I have it by the head
It dug into my jaw

I threw the sucker to the floor
Threw the sucker to the floor
Threw the sucker to the floor
Threw the sucker to the floor
Threw the sucker to the floor
Threw the sucker to the floor
Threw the sucker to the floor

I don't want that sucker in
I don't want that sucker in
I don't want that sucker in
Sucker in

Sucker in
Sucker in
Sucker in...
