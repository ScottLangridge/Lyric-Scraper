To be loving when the knives are out
Takes much courage and a mind without doubt
I'm just some robot, wind up the clockwork jerk
Trying to impress is the nature of my work

And it's so hard to remain open
If it's true, it can't be spoken

Really hard
Really hard

Rhetoriticians think they're running this show
Words as power is all they'll ever know
I'm just some reflex, when struck, the knee will jerk
Trying to impress is the nature of our work

And it's so hard to remain open
If you bend, you won't get broken

Really hard
Really hard

Wake up from this dreaming state
A long scream out, it's not too late
I am dying to begin
I am dying to begin again

Really hard
Really hard
