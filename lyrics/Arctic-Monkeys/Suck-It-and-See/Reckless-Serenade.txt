Topless models
Doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by
And get ignored

Illuminations
On a rainy day
When she walks her footsteps sing
A reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

The type of kisses
Where teeth collide
When she laughs the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby

Those twinkling vixens
With a shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

I left my message but did he forget back to me
Now I'm stuck here wondering
How it's meant to be

Singing a reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade

Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
