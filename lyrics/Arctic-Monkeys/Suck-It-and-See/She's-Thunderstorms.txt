She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet
For acrobatic blood flow concertina
Cheating heartbeat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Here is your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood concertina
Cheating heartbeat, rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Thunderstorms...
Thunderstorms...
