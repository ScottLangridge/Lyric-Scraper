Break a mirror roll the dice, 
Run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight.
Go into business with a grizzly bear, 
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair.

Find a well known hardman and start a fight, 
Wear your shell suit on bonfire night.
Fitting a circular hole with a peg that's square, 
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair.

Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes, 
Kung fu fighting on your roller skates, 
Do the macerana in the devils lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair.
