Library pictures of the quickening canoe,
The first of it's kind to get to the moon.
Draw some ellipses to chase you round the room,
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo.

Been watching all the neon blossom, flickering.
You look as if you've all forgotten, where you've been.
Going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.
3, 2, 1.

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon.
Give me an eeny, meeny miny moe.
Or an ipp dipp, dog-shit rock and roll.
