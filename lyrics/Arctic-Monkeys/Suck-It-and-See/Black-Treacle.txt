Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings in the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it just incase

And now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
Until we find a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Is it true you win when you chew your chin?
And ruining your fun
And you talk the talk alright
Do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
Until we find a place to hide

And now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesiser
And I tried last night to pack away the laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle
