One for the road
One for the road
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake rattle and roll

The cracks in black out blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby I feel like I've been here before
I've be wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go will you pour
Me one for the road

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
Shake rattle and roll

So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby I feel like I've been here before
I've be wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go will you pour
Me one for the road

The mixture hits ya hard
Don't get that sinking feeling
Don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitars
Soundtrack to disaster

One for the road
One for the road
One for the road

So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby I feel like I've been here before
I've be wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go will you pour
Me one for the road
