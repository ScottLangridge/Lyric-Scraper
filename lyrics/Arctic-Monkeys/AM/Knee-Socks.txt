You got the lights on in the afternoon 
And the nights are drawn out long 
And youre kissing to cut through the gloom 
With a cough drop coloured tongue 
You were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high 
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night 
In the right place and time 

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock 
When you know whos calling even though the number is blocked 
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste 
And your knee socks 

Well you cured my January blues yeah, you made it all alright 
I got a feeling I mightve lit the very fuse that you were trying not to light 
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew 
Cause I had nothing to lose 
When the Winters in full swing and your dreams just arent coming true 
Aint it funny what youll do?

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock 
When you know whos calling even though the number is blocked 
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste 
And your knee socks 

In late afternoon the, ghost in your room 
That you always thought didnt approve of you knocking boots 
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot 
By the scruff of your knee socks 

You and me couldve been a team 
Each had a half of a king-and-queen seat 
Like the beginning of Mean Streets you could Be My Baby 

(The zeros lined up but the numbers blocked) 
(When youve come undone) 

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock 
When you know whos calling even though the number is blocked 
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste 
And your knee socks
