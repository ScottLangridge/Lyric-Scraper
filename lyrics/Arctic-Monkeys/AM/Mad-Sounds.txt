Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
Theyll bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears
Make you get up and down, make you get up

Love Ill never stray on those wild nights
Run but you can not escape
Make you get up and down, make you get up
All night long and reappear to make up and down
Yeah they make you get up

Some days we go to watch you
We just dont feel how we want to [?]
You shouldnt try some times
But you just cant figure out what went wrong
But out of nowhere, somebody comes and hits with a uh la la la
Uh la la la
Uh la la la, uh
Uh la la la
Uh la la la
Uh la la la, uh
You got mad sounds in your ear
So make you feel overwhelmed
Mad sounds in your ear
To make overwhelmed
Make you get over
