Blind fate,
Hard to take,
Mind games,
Mistakes,
My sweet fire-ball,
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all,
I want it all.

Old loves,
New tricks,
Can you feel it,
Space age country girls,
Stone cold miracle,
I want it all,
I want it all.

And suddenly it's hit me
It's a year ago,
Since I drank beneath your whiskey,
And we shared your coke,
So ain't it just like you,
To kiss me and then hit the road,
Leave me listening to The Stones,
Two thousand light-years from home.

She-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop,
She-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop,
She-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop, she-wop.

I want it all.
I want it all.
I want it all.
