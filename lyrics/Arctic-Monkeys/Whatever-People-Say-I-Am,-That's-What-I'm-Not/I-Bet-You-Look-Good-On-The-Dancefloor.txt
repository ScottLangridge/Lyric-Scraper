[Verse]
Stop making the eyes at me,
I'll stop making the eyes at you.
And what it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night)
And you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And I fuse the results in a bang baba bang-go

[Chorus:]
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
Don't know what you're looking for
Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

[Verse]
I wish you'd stop ignoring me because you're sending me to despair,
Without a sound yeah you're calling me and I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night)
Oh your an explosion (Your dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And I fuse the results in a bang baba bang-go

[Chorus:]
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

[Verse]
Oh there is no love no, Montague's or Capulet's
Just banging tunes in dj sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

[Chorus:]
Well I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or what
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!
