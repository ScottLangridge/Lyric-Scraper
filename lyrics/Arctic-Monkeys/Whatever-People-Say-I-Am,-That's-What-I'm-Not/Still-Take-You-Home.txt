Well it's ever so funny,
Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright,
But under these lights you look beautiful.
And I'm struggling, I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah and you know it for a fact, that everybody's eating out of your hands

Well what do you know? Oh, you know nothing
But I'd still take you home,
Yeah, I'd still take you home.
So what do you know? You don't know nothing.

Well fancy seeing you in here, you're all tarted up and you don't look the same.
Well I haven't seen you since last year,
And suprisingly you have forgotten my name, but you know it
And you knew it all along
You say you have forgotten,
But you're fibbing, go and tell me I'm wrong.

Well what do you know? Oh, you know nothing,
But I'd still take you home,
Yeah, iid still take you home.
So, what do you know? You don't know nothing, no.

Yeah, so what do you know? Well you don't know nothing, no!
Yeah, but I'd still take you home,
And yeah, I'd still take you home.

I said, what do you know? You don't know nothing.

I fancy you with a passion, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar too.
You're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you,
But it's alright, yeah I put it on one side
And you know that everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes.
Including mine.
