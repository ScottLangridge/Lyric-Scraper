Ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
You're coming up our end aren't you
I'll get one with you
He wouldn't let us have six in
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no though
He didn't have to be rude

See her with the green dress
She talked to me at the bar
How come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Couldn't you see she were gorgeous
She were beyond belief
There was this lad at her side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Can I buy you a tropical reef?

Sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said it's High Green mate
Via Hillsborough please

Well how funny were that sketch earlier
Up at that taxi rank
Oh no you woulda missed it,
It were when you went to the bank
These two lads went round proper shouting
About who was next in the queue
The kind of thing that would seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
You're acting like a silly little boy
And they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
(They said) no surrender
No chance of retreat
