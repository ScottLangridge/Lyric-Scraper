Do the bad thing,
Take off your wedding ring

But it won't make it that much easier,
It might make it worse

Oh the nights like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me but it's alright
She's sayin that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
Hes' not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers makers too good for her to ignore
Well She's talkin but I'm not entirely sure

Ohh Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring

But it wont make it that much easier
It might make it worse

Oh I'm stood at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin to me
But I don't know that is what she is
And she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew how could she not she could have anyone she wants
And I'm strugglin to think of an immediate response

Like I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really Love it's fine
Said really Love it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy,
I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggesting
I struggled to refuse
She said "its the red wine this time, but that is no excuse"
