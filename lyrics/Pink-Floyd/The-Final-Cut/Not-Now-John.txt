Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily japanese
There's too many home fires burning
And not enough trees
So fuck all that
We've got to get on with these
Can't stop lose job mind gone silicon
What bomb get away pay day make hay
Break down need fix big six
Clickity click hold on oh no brrrrrrrrrring bingo!
Make em laugh make em cry make em dance in the aisles
Make em pay make em stay make em feel ok
Not now john
We've got to get on with the film show
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
Who cares what it's all about
As long as the kids go
Not now john
Got to get on with the show
Hang on john
We've got to get on with this
I don't know what it is
But it fits on here like this...
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
But not now john
I've got to get on with this
Hold on john
I think there's something good on
I used to read books but...
It could be the news
Or some other abuse
Or it could be reusable shows
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily japanese
No need to worry about the vietnamese
Got to bring the russian bear to his knees
Well, maybe not the russian bear
Maybe the swedes
We showed argentina
Now lets go and show these
Make us feel tough
And won't maggie be pleased
Nah nah nah nah nah nah!
S'cusi dove il bar
Se para collo pou eine toe bar
S'il vous plait ou est le bar
Oi' where's the fucking bar john!
