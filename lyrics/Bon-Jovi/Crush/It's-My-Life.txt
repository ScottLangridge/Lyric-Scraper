This isn't a song just for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I'm not gonna be just facing in the crowd
You wanna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just wish to live now that I'm alive
It's my life
My heart's like open a driveway
Like he said
I did my way
I'm just dying to live now that I'm alive afterall
It's my life

This is for animals who stood their ground
The people both named Tommy and Gina never backed down
Tomorrow it's getting harder make no mistakes'
Luck's not even luck
Gotta make your own brakes'

It's my life
now or never
just wanna live forever
wanting to live now that I'm alive
It's my life
My heart's open like a highway
When he said " did it my way"
I just wanna live now that I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, honey don't back down

It's my life
now or never
cause you know I'm not gonna live forever
I'm just wanting to live now that I'm alive
It's my life
My heart's like a car driving highway
Like when he said
I did it my way
just wanna live now that I'm alive

It's my life
And it's now or never
I'm not gonna live forever
I want to live when I'm alive
It's my life
My heart's open like driving a car in the driveway
cause when he said
I did it my way
can I just live now that I'm alive
'Afterall it's my life!
