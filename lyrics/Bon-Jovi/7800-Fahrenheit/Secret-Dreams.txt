Riding high, then shot down
I load my guns to fire another round
I look deep into your eyes
And cant run theres nowhere left to hide
Dont stop, no its much too late
When the night comes I cant wait
Oh I live, love to loose control
It makes me crazy I want to let you know

Chorus:
Oh, no, I dont want to fall
Oh, oh, cant you hear me calling
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me Im the one
When Im next to you -- next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.
I got to get to you, get to you, get to you.

Theres a thrill, in the chase
We wont lose when we meet face to lace.
Love, games a means without and end.
I go down but Ill be back again
Thru the night with no retreat
When youre with me in my sleep.

Chorus

I can see you
I feel you every night
I need you
But Im only dreaming
All night long in my secret dreams
You tell me Im the one
When Im next to you -- next to you.
All I want in my secret dreams
Is you here with me.
