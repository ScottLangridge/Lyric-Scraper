After the smoke clears
When its down to you and I
When the sun appears
And theres nothing left but goodbyes
Well just turn and walk away
How could we let it end like this
Just turn and walk away
Should we seal it with a kiss

Its too late
Now youre out and on the run
Its too late
Held up in love without a gun

Chorus
Silent night
We hold up our candle light
Silent night
The night our love died
No words to say
And were both too tired to fight
Just hold me close and don't let go...

It was all so simple when
You were to be queen and Id be your king
I guess those dreams got lost
Cause baby youre still you and I'm still me
Now letting go
Its always the hardest part to fight
When we both know
Were just two more victims of the night

Its too late
Too late to wonder why
Much too late
To save a love that's died.

Chorus

Just hold me close and don't let me go

After the smoke cleared
It was down to you and I
When the sun appeared
There was nothing left but goodbyes...
Silent night
