In the heat of the street of the city
A young boy hides the pain
And he walks so tall, trying to hang on
But he knows hes going down again
I know hes going down...

Darkness fades hes the prince of his city
In a place where they all know your name
You can see in their eyes life so paralyzed.
Your just a pawn in a losin game
You lose at life it aint no game

Chorus:
Hear their cries
The hardest part is the night
(in the night, hear their cries, in the night)
Stay alive
The hardest part is the night, its the night, its the night...

All alone in a place where the lonely
They all have to walk through the rain
And they dance on the edge where you only
Only pray that it has to end
That the night aint no friend

Chorus

These four walls they could tell you some stories
About lying and dying and fame
Theres a price that you pay for the glory
About losing and choosing and pain.

Chorus
