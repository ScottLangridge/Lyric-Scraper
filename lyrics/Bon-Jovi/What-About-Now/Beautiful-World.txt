Every day it's the same when they
Say that it might be the end

In the end when it ends I don't listen to them

You wake up, go to work, go to sleep

Then you do it, you do it,
If you're lucky then you do it again

Yeah, we walk through a world that
We don't understand

When I look in your eyes I'm just happy I can

Yeah we'll laugh and we'll cry and
We'll lose and we'll win

We'll get through it and to prove it
Yeah we'll do it again.

There's glory in the saddest story

[Chorus:]
Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world.

It's a shame when they say that it's
Been done and said

They keep digging that grave let
Them bury their heads

There's a kid with a dream and a
Sky full of stars

There's another first kiss in the back of some car.

Turn the page and write the story

[Chorus:]
Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world.

They're running numbers out of the
Spanish grocery

Where merry Mary says her rosary

Get a ladder, there's a cat up in
A tree

Ah

The Pretzel man's wearing Gucci
Glasses

A widow spreads her lover's ashes

I'll hold on to you, hold on to me,
Yeah

We'll do it, we'll do it, yeah, if we're
Lucky then we'll do it again

Ah

[Chorus:]
Look at it, just sticks and bricks
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit
Where we're going where we've been
This ain't paradise we're living in
It's a diamond, it's a dirty string of pearls
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world.

Oh ain't it a beautiful world.
Oh, oh aint' it a beautiful world.
