You wanna start a fire
It only takes a spark
You gotta get behind the wheel
If you ever gonna try that car
If you wanna take a bite
You better have the teeth
If you want take that step
Then get up of your knees

Cause tonight, we're alive

Who stand for the restless
And the lonely, for the desperate
And the hungry
It's time for the count
I'm hearing you now
For the painful, the believers
For the faithless and the teachers
Stand up and be proud
What about now

You wanna start a fight
You gotta take a swing
You gotta get your hands in the dirt
To see what the harvest will bring
You wanna raise your voice
Don't be scared to breath
Don't be afraid to hurt
Don't be ashamed in me

Cause tonight, we're alive

Who stand for the restless
And the lonely, for the desperate
And the hungry
It's time for the count
I'm hearing you now
For the painful, the believers
For the faithless and the teachers
Stand up and be proud
What about now

Believe for like reasons that shift trough the season, still dreams are just bend, dark and grey
And all of your plans that slip right trough your hands are just sins that you take to your grave

Tonight, we're alive

Who stand for the restless
And the lonely, for the desperate
And the hungry
It's time for the count
I'm hearing you now
For the painful, the believers
For the faithless and the teachers
Stand up and be proud
What about now

What about now
What about now
What about now
