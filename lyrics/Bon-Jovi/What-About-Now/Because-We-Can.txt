I dont wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I aint a soldier but Im here to take a stand
Because we can

*Instrumental*

Shes in the kitchen staring out the window
So tired of living life in black & white
Right now shes missing those technicolor kisses
When he turns down the lights

Lately feeling like a broken promise
In the middle staring down his doubt
Theres only one thing in this world that he knows
He said forever and hell never let her down

I dont wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I ain't a soldier but Im here to take a stand
Because we can

She laid take out on the coffee table
Prepped the dishes poured a glass of wine
Turn down the sound and move a little closer
Just for a moment everything is alright

I dont wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I aint a soldier but Im here to take a stand

Because we ca-an our love can move a mountain
Because we ca-an if you believe in we
Because we ca-an just wrap your arms around me
Because we ca-an we ca-an

*Instrumental*

I dont wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I aint a soldier but Im here to take a stand

I dont wanna be another wave in the ocean
I am a rock not just another grain of sand
I wanna be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
I aint a soldier but Im here to take a stand

Because we ca-an our love can move a mountain
Because we ca-an if you believe in we
Because we ca-an just wrap your arms around me
Because we ca-an we can

Because we can

*Instrumental*
