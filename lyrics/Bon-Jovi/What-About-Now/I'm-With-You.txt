Look at this world
It's filled with worn out places
Forgotten faces and nothing changes
Whatever happened to that new day rising
We're just surviving and living is dying
Aren't you tired of being let down
Another day, another shakedown
I'm With You

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth (I'm With You)
You carry on when it seems no use
I'm With You
If I got one thing I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose (I'm With You)

I walk in shadows that seem all familiar
I've read the papers, a live forsaken
A vacant storefront
I'm an awful sale sign
Down on Main Street you just walk by
How many times you gotta break down
Before somebody's gonna shout out
I'm with you

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth (I'm With You)
You carry on when it seems no use, (I'm With You)
If I got one thing I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose (I'm With You)

[Guitar Solo]

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth (I'm With you)
You carry on when it seems no use, it seems no use

Well I got one thing I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose (I'm With You)
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
