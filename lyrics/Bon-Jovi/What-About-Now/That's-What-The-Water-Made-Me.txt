Baby, baby, baby
No use in trying to save me
There's devils in heaven
There's angels in hell
So blow me one last kiss
Wish me well well

Love is like fingerprints
It don't wash away
I left mine all over you
I'll take the blame

Ask me how, ask me what
Don't ask me why
Baby

That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water
That's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you, will bring you to your knees
That's what the water
That's what the water made me

This world is cracked and crazy
Say one of your pretty prayers for me
No rose in the garden
No wishing well

I don't know how, don't what
Don't know why
Maybe

That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water
That's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you, will bring you to your knees
That's what the water
That's what the water made me

Guitar solo

Ask me how, ask me what
Ask me why

Baby baby, baby
There's no use in trying to save me
There's devils in heaven
There's angels in hell

That's what the water made me
That's who I am and what I'll be
That's what the water
That's what the water made me
There ain't no doubt about it
It makes you, will bring you to your knees
That's what the water
That's what the water made me
