For 30 odd years I was a newspaper man
I made my living with a pen and a pad
God I miss the smell of paper and ink on my hands

Back from the desert for a year or so
I left more in the sand than youll ever know
Another war was waitin for me when I got back home
In the name of flags and evil lies
Im still living, yeah sent there to fight
Well thats my story what else can I say

Hey hey I got a lot to give so cant you see
Im still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want whats left of me
Boarding up the house they left the keys [?]
Rolling on in the city with empty streets [?]
I aint checking out I still got my dream
Does anybody want whats left of me hey hey

You cut your hair and went with a punk rock band [?]
When its all about cvs dvs I dont understand
All thats left on all the t-shirts [?] broke your plan
I sold my drums to make ends meet
They woke up we had to eat
Its he same old s***s that happens for these days

Hey hey I got a lot to give so cant you see
Im still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want whats left of me
Boarding up the house they left the keys [?]
Rolling on in the city with empty streets [?]
I aint checking out I still got my dream
Does anybody want whats left of me hey hey

Well Im a teacher Im a farmer Im a union man
Its getting hard to make a living in this hard land
We working in our factories all these jobs went overseas

Does anybody want does anybody want
Does anybody want whats left of me
I got a lot to give so cant you see
Im still breathing and my heart still beats
They took the car but they left the lease
Does anybody want whats left of me
Does anybody want my old rent [?]
Take the chance [?]
I aint checkin out I still got my dreams
Does anybody want whats left of me hey hey

Does anybody want Does anybody want
Does anybody want whats left of me hey hey
Does anybody want does anybody want
Does anybody want whats left of me
