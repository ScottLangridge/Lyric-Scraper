Ive been lied to, you been cheated
Ive been cried to, you been mistreated
Ive been watching you, you want action
You need love and I need satisfaction

Chorus:
Im burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my hearts on fire
I can't get enough
Its down to the wire
Im making my move, Im looking for you
Im burning for love

Youre the victim it's in your eyes
Im the suspect and loves the crime
Tensions mounting bodies shaking
I can't take the anticipation

Chorus

Now that I got you in my sight
Cant take another sleepless night
Oh, no, no
You can run but you can't hide
Youre the only one I need
To feel the fire inside

Chorus
