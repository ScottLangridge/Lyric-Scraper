Now that youre gone, I can see what
Was going on and how you lied
When youd said youd never love again

Friends telephone and they say
You werent out alone last night
Cant you see that this broken heart
Is killing me

Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Chorus:
Come back cause I need your love
Come back got to have your love
Come back bring your loving back to me
Come back cause its been so long
Come back, and my loves still strong
Come back bring your loving back to me

You play with words play with love
Its just your silly way
Im a fool cause I need you by my side again

Now its too late you walk by
With another man
And I stand alone
Cause I know that youre not coming home

Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Chorus

Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Chorus
