On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
All your life all youve asked whens your daddy gonna talk to you
You were living in another world tryin to get your message through.

No one heard a single word you said.
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your heart.

Chorus:
Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Daddys girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.

A different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
See you out on the streets, call me for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you

You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

Repeat chorus

No one heard a single word she said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your heart

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddys girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddys girl learned fast
Now she works the night away

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddys girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddys girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
