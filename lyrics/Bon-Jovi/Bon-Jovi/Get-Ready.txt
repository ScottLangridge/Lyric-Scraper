You need someone to make it last
No romeos wholl love and leave you fast
They fade away
Tonight youre not gonna be alone
Making love on the telephone
Baby, baby if you can hold on
I'm gonna take you all the way tonight
I like em down and dirty, so hold on tight

Chorus:
Come on get ready
Come on get ready

Youre looking sharp in your dancing shoes
You got the style and you got the moves
Oh youre so hot, girl and on the loose
Youre caught up in a danger zone
Just seventeen but you act full grown
The night life, baby, is turning you on
You want to take me all the way tonight
Take my hand, you can feel the heat
Make you feel alright

Chorus

Come on
Come on
