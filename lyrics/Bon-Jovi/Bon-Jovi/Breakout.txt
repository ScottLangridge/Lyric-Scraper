This time girl I've had enough
Youre too hot to handle with kid gloves
Its too late I hear a knock on the door
The games over baby I can't take it no more

Chorus:
Breakout, breakout
Take these chains from me
You held my heart for ransom
Baby, set it free
Breakout, breakout
Your lies can't hide what I see
I'm better off on my own

Promises made me in the heat of the night (whoa-oh-oh)
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (whoa-oh)
Your lips they burn your body calls my name (whoa-oh)
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (whoa-oh)

Chorus

You say well meet around midnight
Youre gonna make me feel oh so right
I'm saying oh no not tonight
You gotta let me go

Chorus

You say well meet around midnight
Youre gonna make me feel oh so right
I'm saying oh no not tonight
You gotta let me go
