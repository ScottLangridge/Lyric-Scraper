You want commitment
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with a fire, just for you now
Until the end of time
I would do anything
Id beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight
Baby I want you like the roses
Want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
I would give anything
My blood my love my life

If you were in these arms tonight
Id hold you
Id need you
Id get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
Id love you
Id please you
Id tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonights

We stared at the sun
And we made a promise
A promise this world would never blind us
These are my words
Our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers
These prayers keep me strong
Its what I believe
If you were in these arms tonight

If you were in these arms tonight
Id hold you
Id need you
Id get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
Id love you
Id please you
Id tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonights

Your clothes are still scatteder
All over our room
This old place still smells like
Your cheap perfume
Everything here reminds me of you
And there's nothing that i
Wouldnt do to be in your arms

And these were our words
They keep me strong
Id hold you
Id need you
Id get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
Id love you
Id please you
Id tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonights
