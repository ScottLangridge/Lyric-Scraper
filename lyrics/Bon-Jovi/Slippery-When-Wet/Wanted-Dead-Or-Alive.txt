It's all the same, only the names will change
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive

Oh! And I ride!

I'm A cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) Dead or alive

Now I walk these streets, this six string in my hand
Still playin' for keeps, 'same old me same old band,
I been everywhere, and I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces (seen an awful lot of faces)

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I ride, dead or alive
I still drive, dead or alive
Dead or alive [x4]
