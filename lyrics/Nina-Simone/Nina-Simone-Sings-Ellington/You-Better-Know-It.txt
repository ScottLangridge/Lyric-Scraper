(1956) Duke Ellington, Straylor

I belong to you and I know I show it
You belong to me baby you'd better know it
Give me all your love sugar spice and sweet honey
Don't you ever quit

Not for love or money I'd do most anything
Just to amuse you
But ther's nothing that I wouln't do
Thought that I would ever lose you
When I play the game I can't afford to blow it
Cos I play for keeps you'd better know it

Yes I'd do most anything just to amuse you
But there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I ever thought I'd lose you
When I play the game I can't afford to blow it
Cos I play for keeps you better know it
