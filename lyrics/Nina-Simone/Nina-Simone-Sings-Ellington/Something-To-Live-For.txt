(1939) Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn

I want something to live for
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for
Someone who'd take my life and make it seem
Gay as they say it ought to be

Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my
Something to live for
Something to live for
Something to live for
