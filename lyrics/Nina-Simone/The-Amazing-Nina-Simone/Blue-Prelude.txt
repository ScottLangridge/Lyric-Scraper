Gordon Jenkins, Joe Bishop

Let me cry, let me sigh
When I'm blue
Let me go way from this lonely town

Won't be long for my song
Will be thru
Cause I know I'm on my last go-round

All the love I could steal beg or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is Love but a prelude to sorrow
With heartache ahead for your goal

Here I go, now you know
Why I'm leaving
Got the Blues, What can I lose.... Good-bye.
