Bob Dylan

I take
Just like a woman
Yes I do
And I make love
Just like a woman
And I ache
Just like a woman
But I break
Like a little girl

Nobody here feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
And no one has to guess
That baby's got new clothes
Lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And the problems
From her curls

Refrain
I take
Just like a woman...

It was raining from the first
And I was dying her of thirst
That's why I came here
And a long time's curse
And what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear
Ain't it clear

I must admit
I believe it's time for me to quit
And until we meet again
Bein' introduced as friends
Please don't let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry
And it was your world

Refrain
I take
Just like a woman....

Original lyric by Bob Dylan

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand here in the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

(break:)
It raining at first, and I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here.
Ain't it clear...

That I just can't fit.
I believe it's time for us to quit.
But when we met again and are introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world.

You take just like a woman.
You make love just like a woman.
And then you ache just like a woman.
But you break just like a little girl.
