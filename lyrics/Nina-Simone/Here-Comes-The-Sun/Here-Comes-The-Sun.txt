(Refrain)
Here comes the sun Little darlin, here comes the sun I say, it's all right, it's all right
(Repeat 1)

Little Darlin it's been a long cold and lonely winter, little darlin it feels like years since you've been here
(Refrain)

Little darlin the smiles have returned to the faces now little darlin it seems like years since you've been here

Little darlin it's been a long cold lonely winter, little darlin it feels like years since you've been here

Here somes the sun, aren't you glad to see it, I say it's all right

Here comes the sun little darlin, I say it's alright

Here comes the sun, Here comes the sun I say Little Darlin, it seems like years since you've been here
Little darlin here comes the sun, it's all right
You can come on out
