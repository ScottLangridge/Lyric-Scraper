There's a new world commin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a brand new mornin'
That belongs to you and me
A nwe world commin'
The one we had vision of
And it's commin' in peace
Is commin in joy
And commin in love... Yea... Yea... Yea
There's a new world commin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a new day dawning
The one that's for you and me
A new world commin'
The one we've had vision of
And itys commin in peace
Commin' in love
Commin' in peace
Commin' in joy
And commin in peace
Commin' in joy
And commin in love
And I saw another sign in Heaven
Great and marvelous
Seven angels having the seven last plagues
For in them is filled up the Wratrh of God
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire
And them that had gotten the victory over the beast
And over his image
And over his mark
And over his name,
Stand on the sea of glass
With the harps of God all around them.

There's a new world commin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a new day dawning
