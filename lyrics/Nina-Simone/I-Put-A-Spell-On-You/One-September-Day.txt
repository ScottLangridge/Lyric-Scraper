Well you put a lot in and you worked real hard
There were days when you tried, there were days when you stopped
Trying to please the crowd, when their unforgiving
There are easier ways to make a living

Well you've come along way since the start of things
When you've seen the joy, that hard work brings
You've made us cry, you've made us smile
Your in the front, now it's all worth while

Cause there's one day in september
We wont to remember
There isn't any doubting
We'll be in the shouting
Football's such a part of this whole town
And we know that you wont let us down

Well there's nothing better than a nice good win
There's no second prize if you let em' in
You gotta give it you best
Then give again
Out there's no such as winners friends
Well we've been our best, we've been our worst
When we do it right, well we'll come on first
Gotta get in there, and make em' sad
We'll hit em' hard, take the flag

Cause there's one day in september
We wont to remember
There isn't any doubting
We'll be in the shouting
Football's such a part of this whole town(o such a part of this whole town)
And we know that you wont let us down

Cause there's one day in september
In there and fight
Cause there's one day in september
Show em' your might
Cause there's one day in september
Don't let em' in
Football's such a part of this whole town(footballs such a part of this whole town)
And we know that you wont let us down

Cause there's one day in september
In there and fight
Cause we've waited till the finals
Show em' your might
Cause there's one day in septembers
Don't let em' in
Footy's such a part of this whole town(footballs such a part of this whole town)
And we know you wont let us down
