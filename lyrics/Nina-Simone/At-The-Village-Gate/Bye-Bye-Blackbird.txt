Fletcher Henderson, Dixon

Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, singing low,
Bye-bye Blackbird.
Where somebody waits for me, sugar's sweet, so is she,
Bye-bye Blackbird.
No one here can love and understand me.
Oh -- what hard-luck stories they all hand me.
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight,
Blackbird, Bye-bye.
