(1955) M. Rotha (pseud. Of
Fritz Rotter)

A little love that slowly
Grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
A sunny day with hopes up
To the skies
Not a day that comes and
Dies
That's all I want from you

Don't let me down, oh show
Me that you care
Remember when you give, you
Also get your share
Don't let me down, I have
No time to wait
Tomorrow might not come,
When dreamers dream too late

A little love that slowly
Grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
A sunny day with hopes up
To the skies
Not one that comes and dies
That's all I want from you

Don't let me down, oh show
Me that you care
Remember when you give, you
Also get your share
Don't let me down, I have
No time to wait
Tomorrow might not come,
When dreamers dream too late

A little love that slowly
Grows and grows
Not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
