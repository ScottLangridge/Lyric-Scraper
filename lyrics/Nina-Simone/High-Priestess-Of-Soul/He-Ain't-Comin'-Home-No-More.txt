Oh stairs... You look so high tonight
Climbin' up with all my might
Where I got no heart to be
'Cause he ain't comin' home no more.

Oh room... I'm all alone with you
Tell me what's a women to do
When her man is gone
And he ain't comin' home no more.

I'm all choked up... Inside me
Try'na hold back my tears
You know... I just can't get used
I just can't used to this loneliness
How am I gonna face the empty years.

Oh chair... Oh chair
You sittin' silent there
Don't you even care
That my baby's gone... Yea, yea
And he ain't comin' home no more

Yes... For my baby's gone
And he ain't comin' home no more
