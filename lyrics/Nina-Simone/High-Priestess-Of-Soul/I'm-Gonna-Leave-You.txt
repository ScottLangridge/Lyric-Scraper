I'm gonna leave you yes I'm gonna
I'm gonna leave you cos I wanna
And I'll go where people love me
And I'll stay there cos they love me

No more headaches no more heartbreaks
I'm gonna leave you where I met you
I'm gonna leave you whit your money
I want somebody to call me honey

I don't want gold rings
I wanna hear sweet things
I need affection and not protection
When you're teasing you should be squeezing

I'm gonna leave you where I met you
Yes I'm pulled up with your person
And I'm pulled up with your person
And I waited getting frustrated

I'm old fashioned I want my passion
So I'm leaving though I'm grieving
I'm gonna leave you where I met you

I'm gonna leave you
When you're teasing you should be squeezing
I'm gonna leave you

I'm gonna leave you cos I'm gonna
Yes I'm gonna leave you cos I wanna
And I'll go where people love me
And I'll stay there cos they love me

No more headaches no more heartbreaks
I'm gonna leave you where I met you
I'm gonna leave you whit your money
I want somebody to call me honey

I don't want gold rings
I wanna hear sweet things
I need affection and not protection
When you're teasing you should be squeezing

I'm gonna leave you where I met you
Yes I'm pulled up with your person
And I'm pulled up with your person
And I waited getting frustrated

I'm old fashioned I want my passion
So I'm leaving though I'm grieving
I'm gonna leave you where I met you
