I'm the keeper of the flame
My torch of love lights his name
Ask no pity about my shame
I'm the keeper of the flame

Played with fire and I was burned
Gave a heart but I was spurned
All this time how I have yearned
Just to have my love returned

Years have passed by
And the spark still remains
True love can't die
It smolders in flames
When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

Years have passed by
And the spark still remains
True love can't die
It smolders in flames
When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

I'm the keeper of the flame
