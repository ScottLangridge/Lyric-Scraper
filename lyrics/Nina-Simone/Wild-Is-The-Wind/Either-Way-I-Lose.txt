If I stay, I know I'm that I'ma share your love and that I couldn't take. And
If I go, we'll be apart and I know my heart would surely break. So, what
Difference does it make, which one I choose? Either way I lose.

Though I know, my love is true. I'd die if you ever told me good-bye. Ever told
Me good-bye. And I know, she loves you too. She would do, the same as I. What
Difference does it make, which one I choose? Either way I lose. Either way I
Lose. Either way I lose.
