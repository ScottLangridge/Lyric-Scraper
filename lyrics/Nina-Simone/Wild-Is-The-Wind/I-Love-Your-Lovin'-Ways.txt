I Love Your Lovin' Ways when you hold my hand
And with a little ssqueeze you make me understand
That I'm the only one underneath the sun for you, yes, for you
I L Y L W, yes, I L Y L W, yes I do.

I L Y L W when you kiss a kiss
The way you pop it up makes me go for this
Because it makes me feel I'm the only one you need, yes, you need
I L Y L W oh I L Y L W, yes indeed.

Oh yeah, your kisses make taste so good
Oh daddy, tell me, darling, you're not made of wood.

I L Y L W when you hold me tight
You're always good to me and you treat me right
So baby take my love 'cause it's made you, just you
I L Y L W oh I L Y L W yes I do...
