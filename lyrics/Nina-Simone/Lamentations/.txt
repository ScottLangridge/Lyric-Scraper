When life seems full of clouds and rain
I am filled with an awkward pain
Who soothes my achin', thumpin' brain?
- Nobody

When winter comes with snow and sleet
I'm so tired with cold feet
Who says: "Here's two bits Nina honey, go and eat?"
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get me somethin', yes, from somebody, sometime
Well, I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, no time

Now when winter comes all cool and clear
My friends they see me comin' near
Who says: "Come on in child and have a beer?"
- Nobody

When all day long things go amiss
I go home to find some bliss
Who hands to me a glowing kiss?
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from no body - no time
And until I get me somethin', from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, nobody, no time, no time, no body, no time!
