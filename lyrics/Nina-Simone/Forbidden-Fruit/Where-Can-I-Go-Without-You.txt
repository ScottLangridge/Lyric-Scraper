(1953) Peggy Lee, Victor Young

I went to London town to clear up my mind
Then on to Paris for the fun I could find
I found I couldn't leave my memories behind
Where can I go without you

Tried seeing Singapore that wouldn't do
So I went Vienna but I found you there too
Even in Switzerland your memory came through
Where can I go without you

So I wanted to travel and I wanted romance
So I just took off and chased my rainbow across the sea
But it's all over I'm tired of faces and quaint old places
Baby if you won't be there with me

Back on the boat again farewell to France
So long West Germany it hasn't got a chance
I'll trade the sides I've seen for one loving glance
Where can I go without you
