Is it a race, or a chase?
It's a difficult one.
Are you running faster and further away,
Or are you trying to keep up?

Sticks and stones have left you alone,
And all your words will soon desert you.
Are you waiting?

There is no time
For wasting any time.
This is the end of the line,
The definite sign
Of what we will be
Someday.

Where do we start
If we will end apart?
Where do we go from here?
It's head versus heart.
It will all be clear
Someday.

We hear that rumbling song in the distance.
It's coming closer, but we don't like to talk about it.
The sticks and stones won't build you a home,
And every word it will exert you
'til your done.

There is no time
For wasting any time.
This is the end of the line,
The definite sign
Of what we will be
Someday.

Where do we start
If we will end apart?
Where do we go from here?
It's head versus heart.
It will all be clear
Someday.
