Goodnight, daylight
I won't remember you for long
Sleep tight, fistfight
Until December's come and gone

It's only late
You have time
With any reason
That you find

Somewhere in slumber
Is someone who didn't see it coming

If all this leaves you behind
And everything starts to rewind
It doesn't mean anything
You won't remember what you've seen
It could take you a lifetime
A lifetime

You got lost
Lost to the night
It's no loss
You'll be alright
Tell me you feel better
When you're sleeping through the day
And I'll tell you how you missed it when you wake

*Instrumental*

It doesn't mean anything
What you've done or where you; ve been
It was a chance of a lifetime

You got lost
Lost to the night
It's no loss
You'll be alright
Tell me you feel better
When you're sleeping through the day
And I'll tell you how you; ve missed it when you wake up
