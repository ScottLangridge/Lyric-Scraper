Learn to fly
Learn to fly
Show the world
How you tried.
But don't let go
Until you know
Until you know me
'Cause I can see
I can see
All the things
Arresting me
But I control
I control

When I get home
When I get home
I want to feel
Less alone
I couldn't feel
I couldn't feel
Anybody
This isn't home
This isn't home
I couldn't feel
More alone
I need to feel
I need to feel somebody.

'Cause I see the world
In different colours
To someone like you

The city will pull you in
Romantic and drenched in sin
You only have but a time
Until this place will swallow you whole

And everything
I cannot imagine
This dim-lit room
Has seen much before me
And I don't want to ever know (to know)
