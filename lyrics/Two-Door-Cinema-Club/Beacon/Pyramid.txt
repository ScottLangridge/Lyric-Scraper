Take me through the pyramid
Show us life and things that you did

Each and every thing I see
Takes me back before I was me

We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that has ever been and will become

Where are all these singing birds
We would say but that's not what we heard

We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that has ever been and will become

We have seen the world for what it's worth
Everything that's in between can still be done

Just one day is all that we needed so we could believe it all
In some way we already knew it, we just had to prove it all

We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that has ever been and will become

We have seen the world for what it's worth
Everything that's in between can still be done
