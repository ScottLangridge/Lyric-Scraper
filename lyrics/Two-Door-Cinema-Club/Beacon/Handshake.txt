So what became of loving man
And what became of you
Familiar as you shook my hand
What was it you meant to do?
Because all could change for one
And all, could change in this new today

She said the devil will want you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, so you see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you see this man

She said the devil will want you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, so you see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you see this man

I lied, this was not for my pride
I know this was my time

She said the devil will want you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, so you see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you see this man

So when nobody will take you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, and you'll see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you see this man
