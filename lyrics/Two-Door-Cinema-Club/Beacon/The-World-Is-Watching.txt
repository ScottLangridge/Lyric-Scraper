Everyone is here except for me
And I can feel the world is watching
Who is on their own I wonder
And who has cast this spell I'm under

I want you with me
I want you with me

Look into your heart are you happy
You could be the one to set me free
And with your hand in mine we will walk
To a place that knows no one

I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me

I wont forget the things you said
That's dancing and singing inside my head
You've always known your not alone

I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me
