I had watched you taking in the spring
Through dusty sun-kissed bodies wondering

Between you and me
As if they don't see this distraction
This beautiful view
This delicate you in the way

If I follow you tonight
And leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love
Forgotten love

If I follow you then
I will need you closer
One more day is not enough

Anything that I could ask of you
Is more than anything that I could do

What did I say
I cannot say I remember
But every word
Seems so absurd my love

If I follow you tonight
And leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love
Forgotten love

If I follow you then
I will need you closer
One more day is not enough

I don't mind
If all this time
Is all that we had to spend
Everyone carelessly pretend

If I follow you tonight
And leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love
Forgotten love

If I follow you then
I will need you closer
One more day is not enough
