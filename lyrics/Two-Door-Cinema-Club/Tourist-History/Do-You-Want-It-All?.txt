We're low in our hearts
We're low in our heads
But all in good time

Do you want it
Do you want it
Do you want it all?

We're low in our hearts
We're low in our heads
But all in good time
We'll take charge
We'll all take our chances
All in good times

Do you want it
Do you want it
Do you want it all?

All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
