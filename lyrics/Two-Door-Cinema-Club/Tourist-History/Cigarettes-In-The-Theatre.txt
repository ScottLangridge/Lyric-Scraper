It starts in the theatre
A night of encounters
If I hadn't been there
If not for a cigarette

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light
Look past the blinding light
Just keep talking on
Tell me your favorite things
Tell me your favorite things

Difference in opinion was never an issue
Collect all your questions
Because this time we've all night

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light
Look past the blinding light
Just keep talking on (and on, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tell me your favorite things
Tell me your favorite things

Woah

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light
Look past the blinding light
Just keep talking on
Tell me your favorite things
Tell me your favorite things
