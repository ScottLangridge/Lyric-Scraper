I was wrong, I take it back
Now can we get along, give up the slack
You know it all could be much easier
But I'm still travelling, I'm still travelling
And all the while, the people talk
About the unsung shit, that they then stop
And use to please the crowd, the swarming hordes of fun
That was in in-turned glasses

So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing, to be out of line
But it's getting old, by the fifteenth time

Don't take your time, make up your mind
Though it won't change the world, you'll be more inclined
To have a point of view, that makes it through
And keeps you travelling, keeps you travelling
So pick your friends, forget the rest
You can't live life being second best
The critics talk of stubbornness
But you're just passionate, you're just passionate

So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing, to be out of line
But it's getting old, by the fifteenth time

So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing, to be out of line
But it's getting old, by the fifteenth time

So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing, to be out of line
But it's getting old, by the fifteenth time

So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing, to be out of line
But it's getting old, by the fifteenth time
