You would look a little better
Don't you know
If you just wore less make-up
But it's hard to realise
When you're sky high
Fighting off the spaceships

And so you're drinking in your room
To make it all go
It didn't end too soon
You've got the next one
You're holding on too long
You've got to let go
Your other love is gone
And you know

It's too late
It's too late
You've got another one coming
And it's going to be the same

It's too late
It's too late
You've got another one coming
And it's going to be the same

I tried to find a quiet place that we could go
To help you make decisions
But I didn't find it easy to tell them apart
With double vision

And so you're drinking in your room
To make it all go
It didn't end too soon
You've got the next one
You're holding on too long
You've got to let go
Your other love is gone
And you know

It's too late
It's too late
You've got another one coming
And it's going to be the same

It's too late
It's too late
You've got another one coming
And it's going to be the same

It's too late
It's too late
You've got another one coming
And it's going to be the same

It's too late
It's too late
You've got another one coming
And it's going to be the...

It's not the same
It's not the same
It's not the same
You're going to tell me that I'm right
You're going to come back down
And find yourself
Where you are again

You didn't know
You didn't know
You didn't know
So don't pretend you saw it now
It's not something you'd want to happen
Now you know who you are again

It's not the same
It's not the same
It's not the same
You're going to tell me that I'm right
You're going to come back down
And find yourself
Where you are again
