Feel something right
And feel some good
Because if one thing works
You might know it's true

Because if this is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
Then who'd argue?

One year, 5 days
And we're starting new
Try to make a change
It's one more thing to do

Because if this is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
Then who'd argue?
