I must give the impression
That I have the answers for everything
You were so disappointed
To see me unravel so easily

But it's only change
Only everything I know
And even things that seem still
Are still changing

Mother misses her baby
But I only wanted to be me
She changed address and haircuts
And boyfriends and light bulbs, it's easy

But it's only change
Only everything I know
Even things that seem still
Are still changing

I stay focused on details
It keeps me from feeling the big things
But watch the microscope long enough
Things that seem still are still changing

Even the things that seem still are still changing
Even the things that seem still are still
Even the things that seem still are still changing
Even the things that seem still are still changing
