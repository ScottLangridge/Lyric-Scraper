What I've kept with me
And what I've thrown away
Don't know where the hell I've ended up
On this glary, random day
Were the things I really cared about
Just left along the way
For being to pent up and proud

Woke up way too late
Feeling hung over and old
And the sun was shining bright
And I walked barefoot
Down the road
Started thinking about
My old man
It seems that all men
Wanna get into a car and go
Anywhere

Chorus
Here I stand - sad and free
I can't cry and I can't see
What I've done
God... What have I done

Don't you know I'm numb, man
No I can't feel a thing at all
'Cause it's all smiles and business
These days
And I'm indifferent to the loss
I've faith that there's a soul somewhere
Who's leading me around
I wonder if she knows
Which way is down... [on demo: which way is up and which is down...]

Chorus

I poured my heart out
I poured my heart out
It evaporated... See?

Blind man on a canyon's edge
Of a panoramic scene
Or maybe I'm a kite
That's flying high and random
Dangling a string
Or slumped over in a vacant room
Head on a stranger's knee
I'm sure back home
They think I've lost my mind.

Chorus
