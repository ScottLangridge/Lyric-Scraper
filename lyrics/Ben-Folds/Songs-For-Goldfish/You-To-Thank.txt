By the time the buzz was wearing off
We were standing out on the sidewalk
With our tattoos that looked like rings
In the hot Nevada sun

Kids piled high, our moms and dads shook hands
In a party of Polaroid friends
Rented a pool and hired a band
Maybe they knew more then we knew
Cause they danced and drank
While we jumped off the deep end

Oh I've got you to thank
For this

Christmas came around
Yeah and everything was going to crap
And our moms and dads not a clue to be had
Yeah we put on a pretty good act
And they seemed to all need to believe it
So we danced and smiled and paddled hard beneath it

Oh I've got you to thank
For this

You can't say you've never had a doubt
And smoked it down but really wanted out

By the time the buzz was wearing off
We were standing out on the sidewalk
With our tattoos that looked like rings
In the hot Nevada sun
And they won't fade

I've got you to thank
