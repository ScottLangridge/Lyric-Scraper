My Name is Hiro I am 51
Since 1980 life has been no fun
And I don't want to die
I left my family for the secretary
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Her name is Yuko she is 22
She and my daughter were best friends in High School
They say I'm crazy and it's temporary
But I refuse to rot like my contemporaries

I wanna explode
In a Karaoke Supernova

I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
In a Karaoke Supernova, yeah

Last night she dressed me up in hip hop pants
The phat g-stylin rides below your ass
She wants to show me to her mom and dad
I told her I would not be down with that

'cause lately I can feel the years between us
I hope to God my friends at work don't see us
Tonight she asked me if I've ever seen Jesus
'cause she had backstage passes for three of us

I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode, oh oh
In a Karaoke Supernova, yeah

So now she's gone and broke my heart godd*mn her
Turns out she's been fucking this drum programmer
She likes his style, she likes his rock start glamour
Well she's an infant! He can d*mn well have her!

I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
I don't wanna grow old
Won't you let me, Won't you let me explode
In a Karaeoke Supernova
