Queen & Country, freedom cry
God & Glory, Do or Die
Propaganda, Spin and Lie
Who are you fighting for.

Chorus
You do the shooting - they do the looting
You do the killing - they do the drilling
You do the dying - they do the lying
All the way to the Bank
You can hear them crying

Sell the arms, suppress the truth
Create the fear, invent the proof
Wave the flag - don't tell the youth
Who they are fighting for

Chorus

Weapon dealing, profiteering
Country stealing, ethnic clearing
Assett stripping, oil dripping
Architects of War.

Chorus
