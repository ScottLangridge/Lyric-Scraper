Wise men say, only fools rush in.
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows gently to the sea
Darling so we go, some things were meant to be
Take my hand take my whole heart too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows gently to the sea
Darling so we go, some things were meant to be
Take my hand take my whole heart too
'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
