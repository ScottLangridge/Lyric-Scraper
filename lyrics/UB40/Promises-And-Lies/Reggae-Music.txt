I said we friendship come first, the band did come second
And that's why I decided to put it in a song
So listen crowd of people and throw up unnu hands
If you love dem their style and you love dem pattern

[Chorus:]

Reggae music can't refuse it
So give us what we want and mek we gwan

I said yes crowd of people we come back again
I man thriller E. And all me best best friends
I know most of dem from age eleven
And some of dem even before then
We travel the whole world, think it could never end
But don't get me wrong it a no big problem
Cos reggae what we love and that's what we defend
And that there love that could a never end

[Chorus:]

Reggae music can't refuse it
So give us what we want and mek we gwan.

So let me get back to the subject of me friends
Cos me respect and love love the whole of them.
And that there love that could a never end.
And now it is time to hail the whole of them

[Chorus:]

Reggae music can't refuse it
So give us what we want and mek we gwan.
