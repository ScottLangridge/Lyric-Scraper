If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so
You did what you were told and you took the strain
Been left out in the cold, got yourself to blame
But believe me, if it happens again, I'm leaving, if it stays the same, I'm gone
When you're stabbed in the back and there's salt in the wound then it's time to move along
If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so

No more spanners in the works, all the works been done
Had your face rubbed in the dirt on show for every one
But believe me, if it happens again, I'm leaving, if it stays the same, I'm gone
When compromise is the song that you sing, it's been going on to long
If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so

If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so
If it happens again I'm leaving, I'll pack all my things and go
If it happens again there'll be no looking back and I won't say I told you so, I won't say I told you so
