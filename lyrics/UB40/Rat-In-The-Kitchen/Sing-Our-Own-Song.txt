The great flood of tears that we've cried for our brothers and sisters who've died
Over four hundred years has washed away our fears
And strengthened our pride now we turn back the tide

We will no longer hear your command
We will seize the control from your hand
We will fan the flame of our anger and pain
And you'll feel the shame for what you do in gods name

We will fight for the right to be free
And we will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing, we will sing our own song

When the ancient drum rhythms ring, the voice of our forefathers sings
Forward Africa run, our day of freedom has come
For me and for you, Amandla Awethu

We will fight for the right to be free
And we will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing, we will sing our own song
And we will fight for the right to be free
And we will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing, we will sing our own song
And we will fight for the right to be free
And we will build our own society
And we will sing, we will sing, we will sing our own song
And we will fight for the right to be free (Amandla Awethu)
And we will build our own society (Amandla Awethu)
And we will sing (Amandla Awethu), we will sing, we will sing our own song (Amandla Awethu)
And we will fight for the right to be free (Amandla Awethu)
And we will build our own society (Amandla Awethu)
And we will sing (Amandla Awethu), we will sing, we will sing our own song (Amandla Awethu)
And we will fight for the right to be free (Amandla Awethu)
And we will build our own society (Amandla Awethu)
And we will sing, we will sing, we will sing our own song (Amandla Awethu)
