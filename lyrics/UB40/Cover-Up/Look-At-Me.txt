Blame it all on me, you did nothing wrong
I was running free but it took so long
So long in fact that I
Can't remember why
I couldn't say goodbye


If you ask yourself, did I think of you
Oh so many times if you only knew
Knew how you made me feel
In dreams your kiss I'd steal
When nothing else was real


Far away from home everythings so clear
When you're all alone
