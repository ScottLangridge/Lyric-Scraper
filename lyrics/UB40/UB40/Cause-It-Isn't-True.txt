If I spoke in words you didn't understand
Wouldnt that make me a better man
Elocution class to lend a hand
Get me a self-improvement plan

(chorus)

I don't know, it seems to me
Things I do best come easily
I don't feel the need to say to you
Im better cause it isn't true

Exquisite verse to higher the tone
Performed in phrases not my own
To hide the truth to I'll tell a lie
With pictures from another's eye

(chorus)

I don't know, it seems to me
Things I do best........(etc)

If I sport the latest cut of cloth
Would you all assume I'd got some style
And wear my hair just long enough
To turn the heads of fashion for a while

A sports car sexy, slimline, fast
Quick enough to hide my past
Rich enough to open doors
I never could unlock before

(chorus)

I don't know, it seems to me
Things I do best........(etc)
