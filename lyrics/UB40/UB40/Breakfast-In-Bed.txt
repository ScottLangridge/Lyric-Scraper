Chrissie:
Youve been crying your face is a mess
Come in baby, you can wipe the tears on my dress
Shes hurt you again, I can tell
I know that look so well

Ali:

Don't be shy, weve been here before
Pull your shoes off,
And I will lock the door
And no-one has to know, I've come here again
Knowing it'll be like it's always been before

[Chorus:]

Chrissie & ali:

Breakfast in bed, kisses for me
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed, love can make you sing

Chrissie:

What's your hurry, please don't hit and run
We can let her wait, my darling it's been so long

Ali:

Since youve had me here, I've returned again
Darling it will be like it's always been before

Repeat chorus and fade
