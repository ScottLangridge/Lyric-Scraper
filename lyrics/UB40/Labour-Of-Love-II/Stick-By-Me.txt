Stick by me and i'll stick by you
Stick by me and i'll stick by you

My life here on earth would be useless can't you see
If I didn't have you to stick by me
I love you darling and that's no lie
Stick by me and i'll stick by you
When you cry I cry too
Stick by me and i'll stick by you

Friends may try to hurt us
Scandalise our name
But no one (no-one) can tear us apart
You have a place in my heart

I love you darling and that's no lie
Stick by me and i'll stick by you
Remember my heart and love belongs to you
Stick by me and i'll stick by you
When you cry i'll cry too
Stick by me and i'll stick by you

Repeat from friends may try to hurt us...
