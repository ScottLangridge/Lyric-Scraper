Tears from my eyes keep on falling
Cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that weve done together
Ill always remember though you're with another, baby.
Tears from my eyes keep on falling
Cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that weve done together
Ill always remember though you're with another, baby.

I've done everything one man can do, girl
Said every word one man can say
The thing that we had has gone astray, girl
I'm missing you from day to day.

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
Cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that weve done together
Ill always remember though you're with another, baby.
