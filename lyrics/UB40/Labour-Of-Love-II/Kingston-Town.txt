The night seems to fade,
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
The stars shine so bright,
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in kingston town

[Chorus:]

Oh kingston town,
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see, the girls at play
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And when I am king,
Surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king,
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in kingston town

[Chorus:]

And when I am king,
Surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king,
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in kingston town
