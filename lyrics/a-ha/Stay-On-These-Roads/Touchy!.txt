Donna found us in her slow and dreamy way
I can't hear a word the waiter says
She's looking older than the colour of her hair
She walks into the room too pleased to find me there

Me I'm touchy
Touchy you
Me I'm touchy
And you know what to do
Me I'm touchy
Touchy, touchy you
Me I'm touchy and you know what to do

Both of us together in a room by ourselves
I sneeze to look around, byt there's no escape
What can I do, what can I say
She's waiting for this moment to explain itself.

Me I'm touchy
Touchy you
Me I'm touchy
And you know what to do
Me I'm touchy
Touchy, touchy you
Touching love is the best I can do

Hey, this time you've gone too far
You know how touchy we are

Donna found me in her slow and dreamy way
Now she reads me what the paper say
The way she laughs and what I do
I'm waiting for this moment to explain itself through

Me I'm touchy... Etc.
