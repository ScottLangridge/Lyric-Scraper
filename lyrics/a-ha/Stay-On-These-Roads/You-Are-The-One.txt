You are the one who has done me in

Guess you knew from the start

I call again
But there's no-one in

Don't know where
With whom you've been.
But I do love you anyway you want me to.

You are the one
Now this state I'm in
Catching you was so hard.
I fought for you
Did you let me win?
You don't even care
You don't even care where I've been.
But I do love you anyway you want me to.

You are the one...

I've done all I can do
All the letters I've sent through

Put my life in the palms of your hands.
Maybe now you can see that it's got to be me

But if you leave me
I'll understand
Yeah

If you'll leave me
I'll understand.

You are the one who has done me in
Guess you knew from the start

I call your friends
But there's no-one in
Catching you is so hard.
You are the one - you are the one -
You are the one - you are the one!
