The cold has a voice
It talks to me
Stillborn, by choice
It airs no need
To hold


Old man feel the cold
Oh baby don't
Cause I've been told to
Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
Stay on...my love
We shall meet, I know
I know


Where joy should reign
These skies restrain
Shadow your love...'
The voice trails off again


Old man feel the cold
Oh baby don't
Cause I've been told
Stay on these roads
We shall meet, I know
You feel so weak, be strong
Stay on, stay on
We shall meet, I know
I know
Ad lib to end
