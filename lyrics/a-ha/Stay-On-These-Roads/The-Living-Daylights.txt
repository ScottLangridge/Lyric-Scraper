Hey driver
Where're we going? I swear my nerves are showing

Set my hopes up way too high
Living's in the way we die.

Comes the morning and the headlights fade in rain

Of hundred thousand people I'm the one they frame.
I've been waiting long for one of us to say:
Save the darkness
Let it never fade away -
In the living daylights
In the living daylights.

Alright
Hold on tight now
It's down
Down to the wire

Set your hopes up way too high
Living's in the way we die.

Comes the morning and the headlights fade away

Hundred thousand changes
Everything's the same.
I've been waiting long for one of us to say:
Save the darkness
Let it never fade away -
In the living daylights
Living daylights
Living daylights.

Comes the morning and the headlights fade away

Hundred thousand people
I'm the one they frame
In the living daylights
In the living daylights.

Living daylights
- set your hopes up way too high
Living daylights
- living's in the way we die -
Living daylights
- set your hopes up way too high -
Living daylights
- living's in the way we die -
