Night I left the city,
I dreamt of a wolf...

He came from where the winds are cold
And truth is seen through keyholes
... Strange longings never sleep
Now he's come where no hearts beat
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf

You can start, but you cannot stop
You give in, but you can't give up
You can tell all you desperate jokes
To a world that puts
Love on hold
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf

... The sunken-in eyes
And the pain in his cries
A shape in the dark...
Cry wolf
Time to worry
Cry wolf.
