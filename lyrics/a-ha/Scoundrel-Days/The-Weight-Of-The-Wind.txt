Your face looked new against the town
You've come to lose some memories
Like you I've come to touch new grounds
You want to lose
The weight of the wind
Rests hard on your shoulders
Bringing you down
The one that you love
Will never be find


You speak into the falling rain
Words you'd lost, but found again
You see their snakey arms entwined
So clear and cruel
In your jealous mind
You've got to lose
The weight of the wind
Hard on your shoulders
Getting you down
The one that you love
Will never be found
