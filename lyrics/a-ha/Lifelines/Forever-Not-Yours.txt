Hold me tight,
This a lonely night
And I've hurt you, baby
'Cause you're my light

Make me strong was
Like you make me weak
Your hands reach out for me
.... Even in you sleep

Chorus:
I'll soon be gone now,
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours

Memories
The good ones hurt more
Than the bad ones do
Days were hot
And the nights were deep

And I miss you, baby
I miss you, baby

Chorus:
I'll soon be gone now,
Forever not yours
It won't be long now
Forever not yours

I'll soon be gone now

It won't be long now

Forever not, Forever not yours
(I'll soon be gone now)

Forever not yours

It won't be long now

Forever not yours
(Forever not yours)

I'll soon be gone now

Forever not yours

It won't be long now

Forever not yours
(Forever not yours)

I'll soon be gone now

Forever not yours
(Forever not yours)
