(featuring Twista)

Verse 1:(Twista)
Stickin late out night in the evening
But it was like the sun was still beaming
When I saw the 7-4-5 gotta get inside
That's what I'm thinkin
Nothing but a wire in my jacket
Tried to get up the courage to do it
All it takes is a splitsecond to pursuit and get into it
Move ahead with misson, hotwire the igniton
Trying to be quick with the proceedure
Look around in my suspitions
Get the guts cuz I make my mind feel like it's what I deserve
In the car on and empty street as I tell myself don't be scurred
A poor little boy buts it's like when I see through this mans eye's
I feel as good as I ever felt up in this rich mans ride
So I just start it up quickly to make it harder to come get me
Even thought I've done this before
Its like I took a part of him with me
But he ain't lossin no sleep and I'm steady cruzin and creepin'
Breakin no rules and no weaving
While I get away smooth belly breathing
Slowly I get outta sight when I take another player for a lil ride
Lets go to the car to pick up speeders
I drive away through the night, through the night

Chorus:(Sting)
Please take me dancing tonight
I've been all on my own
You promise one day we could
It's what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love
Always head from the light
Take me Dancing
Please take me dancing tonight

Verse 2:(Twista)
First I invison myself as Twista rollin' slick through the hood
Saw me hurting at first but now I sit on leather and wood
Steady waving at the shortays cuz I know I'm lookin cool
Gettin visions about the life of the man who's car I stole
When I'm on the streets like fire as a speedy tire I like it
As I invision myself in this likeness like I'm a psychic
Now I see things he's doing wondering if he's living his life
Hes a company man who's out at night with two kids and a wife
His complications with the new marriage leaving her embarassed
Like his trust ain't no longer cherished with well then how's the love get damaged
Like telling her he's living his life alone in his room
When in the car you could smell the trace of another womans perfume, perfume

Chorus:(Sting)
Please take me dancing tonight
I've been all on my own
You promise one day we could
It's what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love
Always head from the light
Take me Dancing
Please take me dancing tonight

Interlude: 2X
When he could call ha
Thought he was about la
And a bitch I call la
Soon as he saw her

Verse 3:(Twista)
But when he get home will he be able to cover up all of his eyes
As the voice of his lonely mistress started ringing in ma eyes

Chorus: 2X (Sting)
Please take me dancing tonight
I've been all on my own
You promise one day we could
It's what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love
Always head from the light
Take me Dancing
Please take me dancing tonight
