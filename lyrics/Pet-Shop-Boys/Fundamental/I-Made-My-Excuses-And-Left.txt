I walked into the room/ imagine my surprise/
You were sitting close to him/ staring in each
Other's eyes
Each of you looked up/ but no one said A
Wordi felt I should apologise/ for what I
Hadn't heard
A silence filled the room/ awkward as an
Elephant/ in the crowded court of your love
/ I was now A supplicant
And clumsy as I felt/ at stumbling on this
Theft/ to save further embarrassment/ I made
My excises and left
So long ago/ I felt like such A fool/ for
Cryiing/ all that I know/ is when you feel inside
/You're dying/ it all begins again/ defying/
Your excuses
