DON'T WANNA HEAR THE NEWS/ WHAT'S GOING ON/
WHAT'S COMING THROUGH/ I DON'T WANNA KNOW/
DON'T WANNA KNOW/ JUST WANNA HIDE AWAY/ MAKE
MY ESCAPE/ I WANT THE WORLD/ TO LEAVE ME
ALONE/ FEELS LIKE I FEEL TOO MUCH/ I'VE SEEN TOO
MUCH/ FOR A LITTLE WHILE/ I WANT TO FORGET

I WANNA BE NUMB/ I DON'T WANNA FEEL THIS
PAIN NO MORE/ WANA LOSE TOUCH/ I JUST WANNA
GO AND LOCK THE DOOR/ I DON'T WANNA THINK/
I DON'T WANNA FEEL NOTHING/ I WANNA BE NUMB/
I JUST WANNA BE/ WANNA BE NUMB

CAN'T FIND NO SPACE TO BREATHE/ WORLD'S
CLOSING IN/ RIGHT  ON ME NOW/ WELL THAT'S HOW
IT FEELS/ THAT'S HOW IT FEELS/ TOO MUCH LIGHT
THERE'S TOO MUCH SOUND/ I WANNA TURN IT OFF/
WANNA SHUT IT OUT/ I NEED SOME RELIEF/ THINK
THAT LIKE I THINK TOO MUCH/ I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH/
THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH/ THOUGHT IN MY HEAD

I WANNA BE NUMB/ I DON'T WANNA FEEL THIS
PAIN NO MORE/ WANA LOSE TOUCH/ I JUST WANNA
GO AND LOCK THE DOOR/ I DON'T WANNA THINK/
I DON'T WANNA FEEL NOTHING/ I WANNA BE NUMB/
I JUST WANNA BE/ WANNA BE / TAKEN AWAY FROM
ALL THE MADNESS/ NEED TO ESCAPE/ ESCAPE FROM
THE PAIN/ I'M OUT ON THE EDGE/ ABOUT TO LOSE
MY MIND/ FOR A LITTLE WHILE/  FOR A LITTLE WHILE/
I WANNA BE NUMB

I DON'T WANNA THINK/ I DON'T WANNA FEEL
NOTHING/ I WANNA BE NUMB/  I DON'T WANNA FEEL
THIS PAIN NO MORE/ WANA LOSE TOUCH/ I JUST
WANNA GO AND LOCK THE DOOR/ I DON'T WANNA
THINK/ I DON'T WANNA FEEL NOTHING/ I WANNA BE
NUMB/ I JUST WANNA BE/ WANNA BE NUMB/ I JUST
WANNA BE/ WANNA BE NUMB/ ALL THE MADNESS/
I WANNA BE NUMB
