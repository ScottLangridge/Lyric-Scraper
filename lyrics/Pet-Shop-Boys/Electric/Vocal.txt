I like the people
I like the song
This is my kind of music
They play it all night long 
I like the singer
Hes lonely and strange
Every track has a vocal 
And that makes a change
And everything about tonight feels right and so young
And anything Id want to say out loud will be sung

Its in the music
Its in the song
Everyone I hoped would be around has come along
For the music
Its in the music
Its in the song
And the feeling of the ones around us all is so strong 
Its in the music

And everything about tonight feels right and so young
And anything Id want to say out loud will be sung
This is my kind of music
They play it all night long

Expressing passion
Explaining pain
Aspirations for a better life are ordained 
And everything about tonight feels right and so young
And anything Id want to say out loud will be sung
This is my kind of music
They play it all night long
Its in the music
And everything about tonight feels right and so young
And anything Id want to say out loud will be sung
Its in the music
Its in the music
This is my kind of music
They play it all night long
They play it all night long
And the feeling of the ones around us all is so strong 
Is so strong (x18)

I like the people
I like the song
This is my kind of music
They play it all night long 
I like the singer
Hes lonely and strange
Every track has a vocal 
And that makes a change
