[Verse:]
Would you love me Olive?
I hear a dream
Dont say its over over over
Come on, dont fight it
The times for the truth
Dont say its over over over
I miss the meaning,
Express the feeling
Its not over over over
You look unique to me
It speaks of intimacy
And start over over over

[Bridge:]
Come on
Wind your lips

[Pre-Chorus:]
Thursday, gram on Friday
Its soon gonna be the weekend
Lets start tonight baby
Stay with before the week ends

[Chorus:]
Its Thursday night
Lets get it right
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Starting tonight
Lets do it right
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday
Stay with me for the weekend

[Verse:]
It could be now
It could be tomorrow
But its not over over over
Im lost in a dream about you and me
And its not over over over
And youre on for the night
Ill tell my friends
That its not over over over
So tell me tomorrow
Just become thorough
And its not over over over

[Bridge:]
Come on
Wind your lips

[Pre-Chorus:]
Thursday, gram on Friday
Its soon gonna be the weekend
Lets start tonight baby
Stay with before the week ends

[Chorus:]
Its Thursday night
Lets get it right
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Starting tonight
Lets do it right
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday
Stay with me for the weekend

[Verse:]
Imma take that trip down memory lane but youll never gonna feel the same
But youll never gonna take the blame
Change your name, and you rock the game
See your head outside, feel the rain
Someone in yo brain, cant break the chain
Same mistake again, fake the pain again
Day to day, you proud waky waky now
Holy cow youve been gone
You left and now you feel down
Your heart lies back in that town
So creep back and dont make a sound
Or lose your crown again, sleep around again
Tell your friends that youre proud
Or watch yourself or youll really welcome life
Dont follow that crowd

[Bridge:]
I never tried to make you walk into the deep end
And now I find myself awake for all the weekend
I never tried to force that Sunday morning creeping
I want to stay but how much more? Gotta go home

[Chorus:]
Its Thursday night
Lets get it right
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Starting tonight
Lets do it right
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday
I wanna know youre gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday
Saturday, Sunday
Stay with me for the weekend
