[Bridge:]
You walk in
And you light up the room

[Verse:]
Youve been living... in a looking glass scene
Since you... were 17
I cant deny... youve made your move
With a heavy cup to spend the occasional army cup

[Pre-Chorus:]
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When youre in this mood theres no return
Lifes a gamble, throw my dice
Every scandal has it's price
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When youre in this mood theres no return
Fluorescent

[Chorus:]
Fluorescent
Incandescent
Fluorescent
Incandescent

[Bridge:]
You walk in
And you light up the room

[Verse:]
At midnight... its time for business
But who... will bear witness?
To your beauty and refrain
But how well youve played the game?
Youve played the game, youve played the game
Youve played the game, youve played the game
Youve played the game, youve played the game
Youve played the game, youve played the game
Youve played the game

[Pre-Chorus:]
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When youre in this mood theres no return
Lifes a gamble, throw my dice
Every scandal has it's price
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When youre in this mood theres no return
Fluorescent

[Chorus:]
Fluorescent
Incandescent
Fluorescent
Incandescent
