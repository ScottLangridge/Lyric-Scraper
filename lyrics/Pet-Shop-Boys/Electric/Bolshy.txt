(Verse)
Raise your voice
Start a feud
Spoiled for Joyce
I hesitate
To intrude

(Chorus)
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

(Verse)
Get me excited or give me a smile
Ill wait if you say and Ill be worth my while
There you are, pretending youre lonely
I dont believe you, dont know you could own me
Dont know you could own me
You dont know you could own me

(Chorus x2)
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

Oh
Where you lead, my heart will go

(Bridge x2)
There you are
Pretending youre lonely
I dont believe
You dont know you could own me

You dont know you could own me (x14)

(Chorus x3)
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Bolshy bolshy bolshy oh
Where you lead, my heart will go
