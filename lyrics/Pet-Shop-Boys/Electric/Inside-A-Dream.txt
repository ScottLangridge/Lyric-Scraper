(Verse)
To making a ride inside a dream
Live in a world Ive never seen
Wishes come true, that should have him
Looks familiar, feels unseen

(Bridge)
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream

(Chorus x2)
The land of dreams
Is a little far
A ball full of light
Of non-existent

(Verse)
Driving along but some will play
Something I only heard youd take
A new melody with such delay
The music will never fade away

(Chorus x4)
The land of dreams
Is a little far
A ball full of light
Of non-existent
