(Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh
Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh
Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh
Oh-way-oh, oh-way-oh

Ey-ey-ey-ey, ey-ey-ey-ey)

It's something
That look in your eyes tonight
Like magic
It's changing everything in sight

I hear it all around me every day
In the music that you play

This is the sound
Of all boys and girls
You hear it
Playing all over the world
[X2]

Ey-ey-ey-ey, ey-ey-ey-ey

The night sky
Like velvet masks our eyes tonight
And falling
Reveals the sunrise
Ending night

We feel it
All around us
Every day
In the music that we play

This is the sound
Of all boys and girls
You hear it
Playing all over the world
[X3]

(All over the world)
Ey-ey-ey-ey
[X4]

Ay-oh-ay-oh

It's sincere at it's objective
Superficial and true
Easy and predictable
Exciting and new
Just say 'i want you'

This is the sound
Of all boys and girls
You hear it
Playing all over the world
[2x]
