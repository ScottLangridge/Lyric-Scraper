Protection (prevention)
Detection (detention)
There's no where to defect to any more
[X2]

I'm building a wall
A fine wall
Not so much to keep you out
More to keep me in
[X2]

Back then on a bomb site
We were spies among the ruins
Such precocious barbarians
On tv we saw
Cold War

Protection (prevention)
Detection (detention)
There's no where to defect to any more
[X2]

I'm leaving the world
It's all wrong
Not so much what many are doing
Much more what's within us

I'm building a wall
A fine wall
Not so much to keep you out
More to keep me in

Jesus and the man from Angol [?]
Caesar conquered Gaul
Scouting for Centurians
On a Roman war

Through the woods, the trees
And further on, the sea
We lived in the shadow of the wall
Sand in the sandwiches
Wasps in the tea
It was a free country
(Who do you think you are, Captain Britain?)

I'm building a wall
A fine wall
Not so much to keep you out
More to keep me in

I'm losing my head
Well, why not?
More work for the undertaker
Means there's less for me

I'm building a wall
A fine wall
Not so much to keep you out
More to keep me in
[X3]
