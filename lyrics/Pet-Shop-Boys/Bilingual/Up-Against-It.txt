News in this city
Breaks without pity
Long after the war has ended
We're still in fatigues

Up against it
The higher you fly, the further you fall
Up against it
Wondering why we fought after all

Such a cold winter
With scenes as slow as Pinter
Synchronize your watches
There's still time to kill

Up against it (Come up against it, ooh)
Drinking this swill to sweeten the pill
Up against it (Come up against it, ooh)
The more that it hurts, the less that it works

Wrapped in nostalgia to queue for a show
Back to Trafalgar, one kiss, then I'll go

So deep in quicklime
The bones of an old crime
I knew a man who raked them over
He's still suffering

Up against it (Come up against it, ooh)
Buried so deep it gives me the creeps

Up against it (Come up against it, ooh)
The longer you hate, the more that it grates
Up against it (Come up against it, ooh)
Look left, then right, so run for your life

(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh) (Ooh ooh ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh) (Ooh ooooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh) (Ooh ooh ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh) (Ooh ooooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh) (Oooooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh)

Up against it
The more that it hurts, the less that it works

(Oooh - oooh - oooh - oooh - oooh...)
