I don't care what these commentators say
I swear I don't care, for what difference do they make?
I go where I go and I get there fast
Don't stop me, I know that it's not gonna last

(Oooh)
Forever forever
(Saturday night (Saturday night) Saturday night)
Forever forever
(Oooh)
Forever forever
(Saturday night (Saturday night) Saturday night)

If you see someone gorgeous then you think
Am I in with a chance? Should I try? Buy a drink?
Or maybe it's too much like hard work tonight
But if they look my way I might be alright

(Oooh)
Forever forever
(Saturday night (Saturday night) Saturday night)
Forever forever
