(Aaah - Aaah)

Cross a windy bridge one winter night
Past Embankment Gardens enter warmth and light
Face the music (It's never easy)
Forget the chill
Face the future (It's never easy)
Find the will

If life is worth living, it's got to be done
One might be forgiven for thinking it's a life on the run
Many roads will cross through many lives
But somehow you survive

(Oooh, aaah)

Look around, picture what's in store
Is this the final edit, or is the subject now a bore?
Don't shrug your shoulders (It's always easy)
You can't ignore

That life is worth living, it's still worth a damn
One might be forgiven for thinking it's something of a sham
Many words may make it sound contrived
But somehow we're alive

The survivors - Our heads bowed
The survivors - At memorials for other faces in the crowd

Teachers and artists (It's never easy)
And Saturday girls
In suits or sequins (It's never easy)
Or twinsets-and-pearls

If life is worth living, (If life is worth living)
It's got to be run (It's got to be run)
As a means of giving, (As a means of giving)
Not as a race (race) to be won (not to be won)
Many roads will run through many lives
But somehow we'll arrive

(Oooh, aaah, aaah)

Many roads will run through many lives
But somewhere we'll survive
