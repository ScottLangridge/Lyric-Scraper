I can't be cool, or nonchalant
Call me an impulsive fool, you're all I want
You may be right, it's too much too soon
To talk of love all night in your bedroom

I don't know why it always comes as a surprise
To find I'm here with you
You smile, and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true

I won't play games or waste your time
But I won't feel ashamed to speak my mind
So just relax, don't question why
For calculated facts will not apply

I don't know why it always comes as a surprise
To find I'm here with you
You smile, and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true

In my life, there've been few
Who affected me the way you do (you do)
You do (you do)

I'll tell no lies, I won't pretend
But if you've got a broken heart, I'll help it mend

I don't know why it always comes as a surprise
To find I'm here with you
You smile, and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true
Smile, and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true
