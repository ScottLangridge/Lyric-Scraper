Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Why don't you choose me?
Say it's not so
That you'd rather lose me
If you're disposed to say 'forget it'
You don't suppose you might regret it?
Give it a go
It's make or break now
Don't look down your nose
Oh so opaque now
For all we know
There's not much time left
If you give me a 'no'
You'll leave me bereft
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better
Oh no
But in the meantime
Why not give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Take it away
Share all I've got now
Catch the bouquet

Let's tie the knot now
A beautiful day
Your smile has crowned it
If you're looking for love
I think you've found it
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better
Oh no
But in the meantime why not
Give it a go
You could be aiming for a cool type
You know, a real trend setter
Hello
But in the meantime why not
Give me a go
Give me a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
Give it a go
I'm not saying that you can't find yourself someone better
Oh no
But in the meantime why not
Give it a go
You could be aiming for a cool type
You know, a real trend setter
Hello
But in the meantime why not
Give it a go
Give it a go
