(Tennant/Lowe)


What a performance tonight
Should I react or turn off
The light?
Looks like you're picking
A fight
In a blurring of wrong
And right
But how your mood changes
You're a devil, now an angel
Suddenly subtle and solemn
And silent as a monk
You only tell me you love me
When you're drunk

It's better than nothing,
I suppose
Some doors have opened,
Others closed
But I couldn't see you exposed
To the horrors behind some
Of those
Somebody said: listen
Don't you know what
You're missing?
You should be kissing him
Instead of dissing him like
A punk
But you only tell me you love
Me when you're drunk
You only tell me you love me
When you're drunk

All of my friends keep
Asking me
Why, oh, why
Do you not say goodbye?
If you don't even try
You'll be sunk
'Cause you only tell me you
Love me when you're drunk

What's the meaning
When you speak with so
Much feeling?
Is it over when you're sober?
Is it junk?
You only tell me you love me
When you're drunk
You only tell me you love me
When you're drunk
