So my baby's on the road
Doing business, selling loads
Charming everyone there
With the sweetest smile

[Chorus:]
Oh tonight, I miss you
Oh tonight, I wish you
Could be here with me
But - I won't see you
Till you've made it back again
Home and dry
Home and dry

There's a plane at jfk
To fly you back, from far away
All those dark, and frantic
Transatlantic miles

[Chorus:]
Oh tonight, I miss you
Oh tonight, I wish you
Could be here with me
But - I won't see you
Till you've made it back again
Home and dry
Home and dry

Far away
Through night and day
You fly long haul, tonight
Come to me
You know, I'll be here
When you call tonight

[Chorus:]
Oh tonight, I miss you
Oh tonight, I wish you
Could be here with me
But - I won't see you
Till you've made it back again
Home and dry
Home and dry

Home and dry
Home and dry
