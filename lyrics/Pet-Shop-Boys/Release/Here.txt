We all have a dream
Of a place we belong
The fire is burning
And the radio's on
Somebody smiles
And it means 'i love you'
But sometimes we don't notice
When the dream has come true

You've got a home here
Call it what you want
You've got a home here
To return to when you can't
Face the world and you need
Some support to succeed
You've got a home

We all make a mess
Of our lives from time to time
It's part of the process
That you stumble as you climb
And if you ever feel
The pain is far too big a deal
I say with pride
I'll be on your side

You've got a home here
Call it what you want
You've got a home here
You're gonna want it when you can't
Face the world and you need
Some support to succeed
You've got a home
