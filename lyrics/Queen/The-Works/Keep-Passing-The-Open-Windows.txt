This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Do you know what its like to be alone in this world
When youre down and out on your luck and youre a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think its all been a waste of time
Its been a bad year
You start believing everythings gonna be alright
Next minute youre down and youre flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and youre on your way.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you dont have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend
Youre a stranger

All you think about is suicide
One of these days youre gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself its gonna be the end
Oh get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.

This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Love is all you need - baby - love is all you need.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.
