Words and music by brian may

Are you ready? - well are you ready?
Were gonna tear it up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(hey)
Give me your mind baby give me your body
Give me some time baby lets have a party
It aint no time for sleepin baby
Soon its round your street I'm creeping
Youd better be ready

We gonna tear it up
Stir it up
Break it up - baby

You gonna tear it up
Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along

Tear it up
Square it up
Wake it up - baby

Tear it up
Stir it up
Stake it out - and you can't go wrong

Wind me up - wind me up - wind me up - let me go

Tear it up
