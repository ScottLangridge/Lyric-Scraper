Seaside - whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle - highly commendable
Seaside Rendezvous

I feel so romantic - can we do it again
Can we do it again some time
Fantastic, C'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable

I feel like dancing - in the rain
Can I have a volunteer
Just keep right on dancing
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification as a matter of fact
So tres charmant my dear

Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime - I ask you to be my Valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and the the casino
Get a new facial - start a sensational

Seaside Rendezvous - so adorable
Seaside Rendezvous - Oooh Oooh
Seaside Rendezvous - give us a kiss
