Words and music by freddie mercury

I go out to work on monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
Ill be back again before it's time for sunnydown
Ill be lazing on a sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the zoo
I come from london town
I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays I go painting in the louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a saturday night
There he goes again
Ill be lazing on a sunday lazing on a sunday
Lazing on a sunday afternoon
