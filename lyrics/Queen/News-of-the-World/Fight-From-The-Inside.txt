Hey you boy, think that you know what youre doing
You think youre gonna set things to rights
Youre just another picture on a teenage wall
Youre just another sucker ready for a fall

You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside

You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Fight from the inside
Right down the line -

Hey you boy think that you know what youre doing
You think that out in the streets is all free
Youre just another money-spinner tool
Youre just another fool

You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside

You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Fight from the inside
Right down the line -
