Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
He knew it was time
He made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are
You should have been sweeping
Up the emerald bar

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
Cos you know you should do better
That's because your a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time he made up his mind
This could be my last chance
His boss said to him
Now listen boy
Your always dreaming
You've got no real ambition
You won't get very far
Sammy boy don't you know who you are
Why can't you be happy
At the emerald bar

So honey spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
Cos you know you should do better
That's because your a free man

Come on honey - fly with me
