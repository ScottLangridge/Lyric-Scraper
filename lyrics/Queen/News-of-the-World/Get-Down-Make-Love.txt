Get down, make love, get down, make love
Get down, make love, get down, make love

You take my body
I give you heat
You say you hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love (make love) Inside your bed everybody
Get down, make love, get down, make love
Get down, make love, get down, make love

Everytime I get hot, you wanna cool me down
Everytime I get high, you say you wanna come down
You say it's love, in fact it's too much
Everytime I get down, get down, get down, make love

(Get down) I can squeeze (make love) You can shake me (get down) I can feel (make love) When you break me (get down) Come on so heavy (make love, get down) when you take me (Make love)You make love, you make love, you make love, (get down) you make love (make love), You can make me better
Get down, make love, get down, make love

Everytime I get high, you wanna come down
Everytime I get hot, you say you wanna cool me down
You say it's love, in fact it's too much
Everytime I wanna get down, get down, get down

(Make love make love make love make love make love)

Get down, make love, get down, make love
Get down, make love, get down, make love

Everytime I get hot, you wanna cool me down
Everytime I get high, you say you wanna come down
You say it's love, in fact it's too much
Everytime I get down, get down, get down, Make love
