Well shes gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
For so long
See what a fool I've been

Didn't leave no letter didn't leave no warning
I guess I'm all to blame oh lord
Guess I'm all to blame

My little dog aint too hungry he kept on barking
Said it just it just don't seem the same

Well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said mm mm mm mm mm
Oh lord what a fool I've been
And she told what to do

Well shes gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
For so long
See what a fool I've been
