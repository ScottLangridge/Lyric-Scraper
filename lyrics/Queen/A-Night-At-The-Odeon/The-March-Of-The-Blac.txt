Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you and where do you go

Youve never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it -
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night

Here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
Fie-for the black queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on ever finger nail and toe
Weve only begun - begun
Make this make that, keep making all that noise
Now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey chile, yes

A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon hell deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, hell bring a little love

I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm queen of the night
I've got the power - now do the march of the black queen
My life is in your hands, Ill for and Ill fie
Ill be a bad boy - Ill be your bad boy
Ill do the march of the black queen

Walking true to style
Shes vulgar buse and vile
Fie-for the black queen tattos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her is

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand in hand
But now its time to be gone - forever
