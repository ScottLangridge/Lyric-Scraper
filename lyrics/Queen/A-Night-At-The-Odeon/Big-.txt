The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction,
A real big spender,
Good looking, so refined.
Say wouldnt you like to know whats going on in my mind?

Let me get right to the point,
I don't pop my cork for every girl I see.
Hey, big spender,
Spend a little time with me.
