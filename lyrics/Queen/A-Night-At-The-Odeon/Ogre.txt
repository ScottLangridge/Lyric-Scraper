Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold upon the table
And if the black crow flies
Find a new destination
That is the sign

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With mighty tongue he catches flies
And the palm of his hand incredible size
One great big eye
Has to focus in your direction
Now the battle is won
Yeah yeah yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to ogre battle fight

Ah ah ah ah ah
The ogre men are still inside
The two way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down
Right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
Keep a look out
The ogre men are comming out
From the two way mirror mountain
Theyre running up behind
And theyre coming all about
Can't go east cause you gotta go south

Ogre men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow that trumpet cry

Oh oh oh
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
