Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your Earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine, the seven seas of rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy counsellors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine, the seven seas of rhye

Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I'll die
You are mine, I possess you, I belong to you forever

Storm the master-marathon, I'll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive I'll survive, I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile I'll take you to the seven seas of rhye

Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea
Where the brass band plays, tidily, Om, pom, pom
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside the sea
Where they crowd beside the sea
And besides themselves with glee beside the seaside
