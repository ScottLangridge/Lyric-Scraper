Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jump for joy and sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Sitting waiting for the sign
Looking round for the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
If there were time in all the world
Sitting waiting for the sign
Anyway I got to hide away
Hide away

Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Doing all right
