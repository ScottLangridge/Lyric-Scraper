Great king rat died today
Born on the twenty first of may
Died syphillis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldnt you like to know?
Wouldnt you like to know people?
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I dont care I dont care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And thats no lie oh no no no

Wouldnt you like to know?
Wouldnt you like to know?
Wouldnt you like to know?
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Wouldnt you like to know?
Wouldnt you like to know people?
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Dont believe all you read in the bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon youre gonna be h
Dont listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else youll find yourself being the rival
The great lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said youre gonna realise tomorrow

No Im not gonna tell you
What you already know
cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Wouldnt you like to know?
Wouldnt you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great king rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you?
Would you like to see?
