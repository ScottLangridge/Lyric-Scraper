And then I saw him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round him
The beggers shouted and the lepers called him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about him
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down

Then came a man before his feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now go now youre a new man instead
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to bethelehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to bethelehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down to see the lord jesus
All going down
