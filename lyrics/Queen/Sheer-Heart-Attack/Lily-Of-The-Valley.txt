I am for ever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no?
Neptune of the seas
An answer for me please
The lily of the valley doesn't know

I lie and wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course
My Kingdom for a Horse
But each time I grow ols
Serpent of the Nile
Relieve me for a while
And cast me from you're spell, let me go

Messenger from seven seas has flown
To tell the King of Rhye he's lost his Throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace
For the lily of the valley doesn't know
