My new purple shoes, bin amazin the people next door
And my rock n roll 45s, bin enragin the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like its some kinda ritual

Oh give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hairs a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, Ill make the speed of light outta this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things aint free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When youre young, and youre poor, and youre crazy

But oh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hairs a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, Ill make the speed of light outta this place
