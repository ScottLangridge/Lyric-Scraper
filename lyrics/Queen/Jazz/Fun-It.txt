Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight

Get up and dance honey funs for free

Hey everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight
Thats the only sole youll ever meet

Dont shun it fun it
