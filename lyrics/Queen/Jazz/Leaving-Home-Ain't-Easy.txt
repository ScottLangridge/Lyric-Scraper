I take a step outside
And I breathe the air
And I slam the door
And Im on my way
I wont lay no blame
I wont call you names
cause Ive made my break
And I wont look back
Ive turned my back
On those endless games

Im all through with ties
Im all tired of tears
Im a happy man
Dont it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
Theres a road ahead
And theres no way back home
Ohh but I have
Leaving home aint easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back?
Leaving home aint easy
On the one your leaving home

Stay my love my love please stay
Stray my love whats wrong my love?
Whats right my love?
Ohh leaving home aint easy
I thought how could I think of leaving
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home aint necessary
Leave the only way
Leaving home aint easy
But may be the only way
