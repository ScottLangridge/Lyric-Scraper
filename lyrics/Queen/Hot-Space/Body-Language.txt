Words and music by freddie mercury

Give me body give me body body
Give me your body
Don't talk don't talk don't talk don't talk
Baby don't talk
Body language body language body language
Give me your body
Just give me yeah your body
Give me yeah your body
Don't talk
Body language huh huh

You got red lips snakes in your eyes
Long legs great thighs
You got the cutest ass Ive ever seen
Knock me down for a six any time

Look at me I gotta case of body language
Look at me I gotta case of body language
Look at me I gotta case of body language
Look at me I gotta case of body language
Of body language of body language

Yeah sexy body sexy sexy body
I want your body

Body language body language body language
Body language body language body language
Body language body language body language
