I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
C'mon baby, you gotta know why

Ha, take off
Dancer, Dancer
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, Dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, Dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes and come and ride with me
Cool
You're the life and soul of the function
It took me all night to get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries
Yes, what I said
Dancer, Dancer
I can't live with it, I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, Dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, Dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes?
And come along with me
Hot Space, let's go

(Come, come up, yeah, yeah)

Take it
Oh, when I feel you baby
Dancer, Dancer
I can't believe you're dancing
Dancer, Dancer
Can't take you home, I gotta take your dancing
Dancer, Dancer
Bring on the funk and dance the night away
Dancer, Dancer
You got boogie

Oh, let's get down
Don't shout about it
Please say yeah
Dancer, Dancer
You're my temptation
Dancer, Dancer
Dancer, Dancer
Oh, c'mon and dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
"Guten morgen. Sie wnschten, geweckt zu werden"
Dancer, Dancer
Dancer, Dancer
Dancer, Dancer
C'mon sugar, shake on up
