Calling all boys
Calling all people on streets
Around the world
Take this message
A message for you

Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love

Some sleepless nights in wait for you
Some foreign presence you feel, comes
Creeping through
Some stream of hope
The whole world through
Spread like some silent disease
Youll get yours too
This message is
Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear
Calling all girls
Calling all boys
