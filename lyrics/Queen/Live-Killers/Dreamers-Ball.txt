Words and music by brian may

Oh I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now youve found another partner
And left me like a broken toy

Oh its someone else youre takin
Someone else youre playin to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm wakin
Ill go to sleep and dream I'm with you

Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamers ball
Ill be right on time and Ill dress so fine
Youre gonna love me when you see me
I wont have to worry
Take me take me
Promise not to wake me till its morning
Its all been true

What you say about that hey honey?
You gonna take me to that dreamers ball?
Id like that
Right on down forty-second street
Way down down town dreamers town

Oh take me take me take me
I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember Ill be dreamin of my baby
At the dreamers ball

Take me hold me
Remember what you told me
Youd meet me at the dreamers ball
Ill meet you at the dreamers ball
