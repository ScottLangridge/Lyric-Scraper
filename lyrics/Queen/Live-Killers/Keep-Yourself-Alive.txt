I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
How I had to keep on trying
Little better evry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then Id still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you
To be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
Itll take you all your time and a money
Honey youll survive

Well Ive loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me evrything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And Ill grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better evry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then Id still be where I started
Still be where I started

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
Itll take you all your time and money honey
Youll survive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Itll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Do you think youre better evry day
No I just think Im two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive mm
You take your time and take your money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Itll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
