Take me to the room where the reds all red
Take me out of my head-s what I said yeah
Hey take me to the room where the greens all green
And from what I've seen its hot its mean

-gonna use my stack
-its gotta be mack
-gonna get me on the track
-got a dragon on my back

Take me to the room where the beats all round
Gonna eat that sound - (yeah yeah yeah!)
Take me to the room where the blacks all white
And the whites all black take me back to the shack

-she don't take no prisoners
-gonna give me the business
-got a dragon on my back
-its a dragon attack

Get down - I said so
Hey hey - all right

Shes low down

Slow down
-i gotta make my way
