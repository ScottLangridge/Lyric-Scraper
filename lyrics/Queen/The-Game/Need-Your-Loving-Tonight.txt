Words and music by john deacon

No Ill never look back in anger
No Ill never find me an answer
You promised me youd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said Id never never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger no
Cos Id rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said Id never never be angry with you

I must be strong so she wont know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on Ill forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
Ill eat my heart out cos I love her
Love her love her love her

Come on baby lets get together
Ill love you baby Ill love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change? What did I say?
Ooh I need your loving tonight
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight
Hit me

Ooh I need your loving tonight

No Ill never look back in anger
No Ill never find me an answer
Can't be no warning how could I guess?
Ill have to learn to forgive and forget
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving tonight
