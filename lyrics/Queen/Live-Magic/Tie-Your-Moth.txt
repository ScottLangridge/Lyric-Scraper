Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin baby
Got your timin right
Got your act all tight
Its gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you wont
And I'm boilin up inside
Aint no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

Youre such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousin an snipin

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother swimmin
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your mother down,
Tie your mother down
Or you aint no friend of mine

Your momma and your daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace lovin guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down. .. Etc etc. ..
