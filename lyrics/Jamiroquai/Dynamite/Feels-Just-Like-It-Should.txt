I'm coming down to see ya
I'm looking for fast and cheap
I'm looking for the city streets

I'm gonna get experience
I've been to see the candy man
Just turn it up and drown

He said
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should (I'm gonna get experience)
Feels just like it should (turn it up and drown)

I'm going out wirth laser beams
To shoot some cherries down
I took a little free agent
I've got myself a five mile smile

So take me for the first time
I need a little sugar spice
I wanna see the city lights
I'm gonna find a lover

She said
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should

Feels just like it should (I'm looking for the city streets)
Feels just like it should (gonna get experience)
Feels just like it should (I'm here to see the candy man)
Feels just like it should

Sugar spice
I'm on the phone
It feels good i need a little sexfunk right now
I want you, I wanna lick you up and down
It feels good, you said it would feel that good and it does

Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
Feels just like it should
