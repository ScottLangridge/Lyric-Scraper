The papers you've arranged
In a sense they're strange
They speak to me like constellations as we lie here
There's a magic I can't hold
Your smile of honey gold
And that you never seem to be in short supply of

Chorus:
Oooooh
So baby let's get it on
Drinkin' wine and killin' time
Sitting in the summer sun
You know
I've wanted you so long
Why'd you have to drop that bomb on me

The lazy days
Crazy dolls
You said we've been friends for too long

Seven days in sunny June
But long enough to bloom
The flowers on the sunlight dress you wore in spring
The way we laughed as one
And then you dropped the bomb
But I know you too long for us to have a thing

*Chorus 2X*

Gotta get this
The stories in your eyes
Tell of silent wings
You fly away on

Seven days in sunny June
But long enough to bloom
The flowers on that sunbeamed dress you wore in spring
Yeah yeah
The way we laughed as one
Why did you drop that bomb on me

Repeat Chorus
Could it be this
The honey suckled dancing you'd seem to show me
Could it be this
For seven days in June I wasn't lonely
Could it be this
You never gave me time to say I love you
Could it be this
I know you don't believe me but it's so true
Don't walk away from me girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me
I read the stories in your eyes
If you've been telling me we've been friends for too long
Yeah
Why'd you wanna drop the bomb
Telling me we've been friends for too long
Why'd you go and drop the bomb
You tell me that we've been friends for too long
Yeah
