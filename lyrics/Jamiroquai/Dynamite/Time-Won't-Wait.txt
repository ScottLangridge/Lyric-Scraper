Hey, time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up every day (2x)

She was sleeping at the bus stop
Ebbing away
But a magic in her blue eyes
Told me she had left her daze
So I asked to share her wisdom
And there was no doubt
I told her I was sitting low down on the crest fall
The future's trying catch me out

She said time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up to get in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied
And love won't change you boy, it's true
I can tell you 'till my face is blue
Every second screams
Listen to your dreams
Ooh, 'cause you just can't stop the clock

On a brick that I was banging open my head
Over my head
But there's sweet wings on my feet now
Where once they were made of lead
Do you hear a message in the music
I hear it too
You know, you got your history in the making
And slowing down won't get you through
No no

Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
Better hurry up
Take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied
And love won't change you boy, it's true
I can tell you 'till my face is blue
Every second screams
Listen to your dreams
'Cause you just can't stop the clock

Time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up everyday
Time won't wait for you
Keeps on ticking away
Burning up everyday

Keeps on
You know and it keeps on
You know and it keeps on
It keeps on ticking yeah

Keeps on
You know and it keeps on
You know and it keeps on
Keeps on ticking baby

Time won't wait for you
So do all the things you wanted to
You better hurry up
Hey take it in your stride
Use your resolution which you've been supplied
Love won't change you boy, it's true
I can tell you 'till my face is blue
Every second screams
Listen to your dreams
Ooh, 'cause you just can't stop the clock

You know our times all
Ticking away yeah
It's all
Ticking away yeah
Time it keeps on
Ticking away
Won't stop ticking away
Time won't wait for you
Won't wait for you
Oh won't wait for you.
No
That's time
