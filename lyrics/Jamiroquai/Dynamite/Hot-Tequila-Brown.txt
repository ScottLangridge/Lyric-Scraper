How many times
Can a man watch the sun rise
Over his head
Without feeling free?

How many words
Will fail me in my negligence
To arrest, oh yes
This crazy part of me?

How many fools
Will I let unlock the door to my heart?
When I know that, I know that
They shouldn't have had the key

It's been so long
And the groove in my heart is nearly gone
Oh, my head's in the clouds
But I'm landing on my feet

[Chorus:]
Don't shoot me down
Sun shine, shine down
I'm hot tequila brown
Don't shoot me down
I'm stone cold but I'm lying here
Sun shine, shine down

How many lives
Will I lose on the battle lines
Inside of my mind?
I think I've had enough

Don't shoot me down
All I want to see is my black eyes turn back to brown
Cross that Rubicon
I think I really must

[Chorus x4]

Sun shine, shine down
Sun shine, shine down

[Repeat to fade]
