Now she's stinging the rain 'cos she's
Got so much to give
(Girl's got crazy rhythm)
And I still don't know her name but I
Really wish I did
(Girl's got crazy rhythm)
There's magic in her moves and I bet
You never knew
(Girl's got crazy rhythm)
Come on stand here for a while,
She's sending it to you
(Girl's got crazy rhythm)
I love it when you

Get on down and work me babe
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, outta space
Escalator to elation any place

Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face

She got it

Straight ahead, you and me
Something I can hold forever
Love it when she's tearing up the breaks

She's a dream, a fantasy
I don't need too much persuading
Giving up the hearts she wants to take

Now and then I wonder why
Cupid's shot me with his arrow
See my wings are melting in the sun
Got my head in a spin
There's no doubt that she's begun to

Get on down and work me babe
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, outta space
Escalator to elation any place

Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face

She got it

Get on down and work me babe
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, outta space
Escalator to elation any place

Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face

I love it when you

Get on down and work me baby
On your knees, once again
She's a fast persuader, outta space
Escalator to elation any place

Girl's got crazy rhythm
She's coming from a stranger place
All wrapped up in music
With a star gaze on her face

You know she's got it
Get on down, come on work me baby
And she never ever gonna let it go
Get on down, come on work me baby

She got it
She got it

You, you got me wrapped up in your
Music yeh
You got me wrapped up in your
Music yeh
Get on down, come on work me baby

Yeh, I'm traveling at the speed of light
Tonight baby
Yeh, I'm traveling at the speed of
Sound (getting down)
Yeh, I'm traveling at the speed of light
Tonight baby
Yeh, I'm traveling at the speed of
Sound (getting down)
