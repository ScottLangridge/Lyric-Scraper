Goodbye
Goodbye

Seems like I knew you since you
Were a little girl
Cried out to you, never thought
That you'd ruin my world
Now we're all broke up
I glimpse you on the street
Just gotta put up, shut up,
Because we've split the sheets

This world keeps spinning around
But I just don't care
I had my name written up in lights
Wanted you to share
I don't mind to do my thing, to do
Yours yourself
I can't stick around here no it's bad
For my health

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
And though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(and there's no-one to hold me)

Got your letter just yesterday
So you might as well get outta here
Because you been paid
It doesn't matter cos I've got my lover
And she's into me
But I'm finding it hard inside to set
You free

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
And though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(and there's no-one to hold me)

Keeping all the hearts you get to break
I've got another lover who loves
Mistakes
I never get close enough to touch
'Cause you're cool when you're burning
Cool when you're burning

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
And though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(And there's no-one to hold me)

Now I pretend
That I don't care
But I'm a lonely man
And I'm running scared

It's over now
So baby walk away
It's broken down
It won't work again

(And there's no-one to hold me)

Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
I got to walk away baby
Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
I gotta set you free baby

Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
I gotta let you go
Goodbye

(And there's no-one to hold me)
Nobody to hold me, no oh no

Goodbye to my dancer
