Rock, dust, light, star
And it's coming at you, baby.

I'm the man on the moon; I hope I don't come back too soon
Am I the only one to see light?
No use in getting down upon your knees tonight

So I don't feel love, because I got no faith
I've seen those twisted lies thrown back into my face
I've heard the crazy doctrines of the human race
I must be alone

How could it be, your gift to me the salvo of heavy artillery?
It's nothing but your war  you can call it what you like
I know where I'm from and it's cold and dark
'Cause all the sinners are just saints without the sparks
I'm having trouble telling them apart, oh yeah

I'm coming out to
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you baby, 36, 000 miles an hour
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you baby, what you're made of is what you are

Now look and see those stars for you and me
Waiting like silent canons in the night
Atomic legions you can never fight
I've never felt I ever prayed
Don't have to join in with the other slaves
I'm not the only one who feels betrayed

See, the more I think about it, I'm going against the grain
Oh, I won't be born again
Salvation's coming from up high
(Coming at you baby, through the sky from up high)

Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you baby, 36, 000 miles an hour
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you baby, what you're made of is what you are

Rock, dust, light, star
Rock, dust, light, star

I'm a square peg in a round hole
Maybe there's place left for my wounded soul
Maybe the king of kings has finally lost control of it

Coming at you baby
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you baby, 36, 000 miles an hour

Chin up, salvations coming
Coming at you baby, 36, 000 miles an hour
Chin up, salvations coming
Coming at you baby, what you're made of is what you are

Look up and see
Rock, dust, light, star
