Yeah Gonna make it better
Ooh yeah
Yeah Gonna make it right
Here it is
There's no way to make it better
Get's you down
It's pressure (pressure)
I'm serious
Trouble genie's on the way
Got a little something for you
It's pressure (pressure)
It gets ya down
Now we need what you know
But I knew that anyway
I can't let this pressure go
This pressure's here to stay

[Chorus]
Yeah (white knuckle ride)
Gonna make it better (white knuckle ride, I'm on it)
Yeah (white knuckle ride)
Gonna make it right (white knuckle ride, I'm on it)
It's not so easy to control(pressure)
It's not so easy to control (pressure)

There's no easy way to make it better
There it is, There it is
Couldn't change it if I wanted
Taste it all the time
It's pressure (pressure)
Yeah hey! 
Oh baby
So true
Don't know if I can recover (don't know if I can recover)
Got me 'round it's little finger (got him 'round it's little finger)
It's pressure
Oh, there it is
Couldn't change it if I wanted
Taste it all the time

Step into the light! 
Don't know if I can recover
Taste it all the time (taste it all the time, yeah)
Yeah, gonna make it better (white knuckle ride, I'm on it)
Yeah (white knuckle ride)
Gonna make it right (white knuckle ride, I'm on it)
It's not so easy to control
