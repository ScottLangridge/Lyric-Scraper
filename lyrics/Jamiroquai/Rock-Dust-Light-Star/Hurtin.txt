Here is the queen
And it's dust to dust
Things aint changing
But ( I know) I must
I've been hurting

I've seen dizzy
No return
 
Tags saved the measures
But still got burned
I have been hurting
All I need is you
 
How the hell did I loose ya
Heads not right
Much too loose
It's not screwed on tight
Ive been hurting
All I Need is you

Chorus

How the hell did I loose ya
My heads not right
How the hell did I loose ya
Its not screwed on tight
How the hell did I loose ya
Ive been hurting
All I Need you

Hanging out
Head too dry
Ive e been hurting
It made me cry
And Ive been hurting
All I need is you

Dont get worried
Keep the lit on tight
But it's hard to take in
I take it every night
Ive been hurting
And all I need is you

How the hell did I loose ya
My head s not right
How the hell did I loose ya
Its not screwed on tight
How the hell did I loose ya
Ive been Hurting
All I need is You

He got a head for money
He had a head for sin
Gonna bail lets face it
Were gonna fly it in 
Ive been hurting
All I need is you

How the hell did I loose ya

How the hell did I loose ya
My head is not right
How the hell did I loose ya ( much too loose
Not screwed on tight
Ive been hurting
Because all I need is you
 
To days
To queen
Dust to dust
Things keep changing

Cant get out
That's not right
Ive been hurting
