Every bird will sing, the melody of our love tune...
Ooh, Yesterday I was
Half the man I used to be
Maybe that's because
You're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom
The summer of our love is soon
Every bird will sing
The melody of our love tune
Send down from above
Unconditionally love
Likened to a flower
Stronger love grows by the hour
Stormy weather days
Make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease
Now you got me down on my knees
Hey, yesterday I was
Brighter than the morning sun
Now my love is lost
And lonely days have just begun
A solitary chair
For a silent love affair
A king has lost his throne
And now he sits alone, yeah yeah
Every bird will sing
Hey, oh now every bird will sing
Every bird will sing the
Sing the melody of our love tune
Oh every bird
Every bird
Every bird
Will sing the melody of our love tune
Hey, I wanna tell you
Oh, now yesterday I was
Half the man I used to be
Oh, maybe that's because
You're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom
The summer of our love is soon
Now every bird will sing
The melody of our love tune.
Oh yeah...
Ooh, every bird will sing the melody
The melody did I tell you darling?
Yesterday I was
Half the man I used to be
Oh, maybe that's because
You're the other half of me
Like the spring in bloom
The summer of our love is soon
Now every bird will sing
The melody of our love tune
Every bird
Ahh now every bird will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird x3
Will sing the melody of our love tune
Every bird
Will sing the melody of our love
Tune...
