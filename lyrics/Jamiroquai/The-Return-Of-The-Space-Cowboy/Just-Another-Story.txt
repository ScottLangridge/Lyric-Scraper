Now, it occured to me
As I awoke from deeper dreams.
All this evolution..
And still I don't know what it means.
Hey
And it gets hard for me to change,
When there's an easy way to earn.
Why should I work my fingers to the bone? (To the bone)
Is this what I truly deserve?

This is not another trilogy
It's just another story x6
Just another story baby

Nobody make a move
This kid's got you covered,
He was just seventeen
Trying to get on like his dead brother.
Momma couldn't do a thing about him
Though she hurt inside
And Daddy wants his son back
While him knows he's still alive.
Stick-up kid, thinking you're a glory boy,
Oh, fronting that stupid toy
But you don't get that it's yourself you will destroy
Like a speed freak king of amphetamine
Still running those rocks on the front line
Get up tight when it's your turn
A bullet in the head is the lesson learned
One of these days you're gonna say goodbye
Telling everyone you've never been so high
Born the same time that you die
You're pushing that draw like you're Superfly
Heaven help all with no way out
That's what this is all about
This is not another trilogy
It's just another story baby

Hit it with me now
Come on now hit it with me now
Stick-up kid
A ha ha ha ha,
I got you where I want ya!
Nobody make a fucking move!
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
All these gangster kids are getting uptight
I got ya! I got ya where I want ya now
Nobody make a fucking move

Nobody make a move
This kid's got you covered,
He was just seventeen
Trying to get on like his dead brother.
Momma couldn't do a thing about him
Though she hurt inside
And Daddy wants his son back
While him knows he's still alive.

This is just another story
All your broken glories.
Say this is just another story, yeah
Push it to the outer ridge
Everyday, everyday, happens everyday
Stick-up kid
Come on now, aw, come on now
Push it to the outer ridge
A ha ha ha ha!
Stick-up kid
This is not another trilogy, it's just another story
