There's a stillness in time
Which I cannot define
Does your heart bleed like mine?
For a place we can go
Where the troubles of our time are far away
And I had all my life in front of me
Now my darkest days are trouble free
There's no place where I would rather be
Than this journey of discovery
I found love in that way
And I'm never sad,
And I'm always glad
Anything you give me today
I will be thankful for
People find it hard to be strong
'cause they don't know
Where they're coming from
There was nothing left to do
But hang on for a stillness in time
If you find something's goin' wrong
Look around at what you're running from
There are many wondrous things for you to see
If this world is turning too fast for your head
Just remember how bad times can roll instead
You can wait a thousand years in line
For a stillness in time
