Hey Hey Yeah I've got to scam
Got to scam
Ooh, got to scam

You say you fight to give us freedom
But often more than not this is abused
And the faces of a tired generation
Have decided they are sick of being used

For the purpose of current declarations
Still the same, it'll never change until the end
Is to buy appreciation of the nation
To cover the mistakes you must defend

And you say they'll be a chance for everyone
To protest against your calculated greed
But I can see into the future
Won't be long before the welfare
Send me letters telling me how much they need

And it's not been in my interests to please them
For the only interest rate to fall is mine
See a brand new generation is demanding
What you've been doing with our money all this time

Cause Now I've got to Scam!
People try living life at speed of light.
Scam!
I don't know why but I have to do the things I do.
Scam!
Give me ten that's the move I'll give you five
Scam!
People say that it's the way to stay alive

Scam now...
Scam!
Hey, I know we gotta scam, I know we gotta scam, ooh

So you see you have to be a schemer
If you wanna love the life you have to live
And don't matter how much I earn
Cause I always get my fingers burnt
When the man gets down to his business

And I've been ser-ser-searching for a reason
Why I have to give it all up just when I'm gonna get ahead
See I had lose car, job, wife, dog and home
Debts and threats on the telephone
Maybe I should bust a move instead

Hey, now we all know when we watch the television
Not confused between a puppet or conviction
Glued to the screen by a thousand shallow words of wisdom
It ain't what it seems when it's a single sided system

Hey, someone's got a hold on my living
Gonna have to do the thing that's fair
They got to justify for what I should be giving
Should I lie, should I steal or should I care?
Hey
Because I got to scam
Scamming our life away

Hey!
Scam!
People try living life at speed of light.
Scam!
I don't know why but I have to do the things I do.
Scam!
Hey.. Everybody got to scam now
Scam!
Oooh, bust that move as quick as you can, scam!

Right on
Ahh scamming!
Hey hey hey, hey! Hey!
I got, I got to scam
Got to scam to get me through every day
Got to scam
Got to scam
I got to scam

Woah
Scamming for every day
Scamming for all my life
Scamming... To pay my way

Hey
I got to scam!
No nine to five!
I gotta stay alive!
Gotta keep it all
Hey, I got to scam

Scamming... Scamming... Scamming... Scamming
Hey...
