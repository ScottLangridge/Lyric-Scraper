Everything is good and brown
Oh I'm here again with a sunshine smile upon my face,
My friends, they're close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad I found somebody who I can rely on

Chorus
This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary good vibe zone
Say at the speed of Cheeba you and I go deeper
Maybe I'll have to get high just to get by

Everything is good and green
Oh I'm red again and I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly now high in the sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames of happiness
To shade his eyes he's glad he found somebody who he can rely on
