Four hundred years or more
Since you came to crucify
They were taken far from home
There were promises of paradise
But if they had been told that day
That they would be sold this way
To satisfy the souls of chosen men
See I had to look carefully
At the shame of my ancestry
To re-define the story line again
If I was taken for a day
And shown another way
Every child can learn a different thing
See I tried a million times
But I had to change my mind
Sadness was the best thing I could bring
On the inside he was dead and this is what he said
As he took away the bloom above the clouds
Superiority was clearly meant to be
So destiny will manifest in time
So where has the love all gone
A troubled trail of tears will tell the tale
Of how I was put down where I don't belong
Woman, Child, and man for sale
For ethical slavery is just an absurdity
How can you be alive when you are dead
With these chains of hypocrisy
The shame of my ancestry
Forever stained with blood in which you tread
(repeat chorus)
