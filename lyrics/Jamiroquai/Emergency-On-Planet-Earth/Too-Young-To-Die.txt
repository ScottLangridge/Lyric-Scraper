Everybody, don't want no war
Cause we're too young to die
Many people, all around the world
Now seen their brothers fry
What's the motive?
To our problems in your madness
You've made my people cry
So politicians, this time keep your distance
Cause we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die.
What's the answer?
To our problems
I think we've gone too high
Little children never said a word now
But still they have to die
It won't be long dancing like we do now
To put this sad world right
So don't you worry
Suffer no more cause we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
You know we're too young to die
Rap
All gone when they drop the bomb.
Can the politicians reassure?
Cause here I am presuming that nobody wants a war.
There's so many people praying
Just to find out if they're staying.
But lately stately governements
And disillusioned leaders,
So full of empty promises
But rarely do they really feed us,
Put our backs against the wall
Or don't we count at all
Can you decide, are you mesmerised.
Do you know which side you're standing?
Cause when it falls gonna take us all.
Gotta know what we're demanding,
I never lie can't you hear the cry,
Coming from on high,
We're too young to die!!!
