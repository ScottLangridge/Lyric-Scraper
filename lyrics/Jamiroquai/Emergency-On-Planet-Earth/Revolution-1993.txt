You've got to stand up
Stay strong
Start movin' in the right direction
Don't wait
Too long
For people promising divine intervention
19 nine three
Now I'm taking matters into my own hands
So fast
I can't see
A revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power
Well it's hard times
White lines
Kids of nine gettin' down with gun crime
War zones
No homes
Ain't it time we gave the dog a bone
Say brothers
Sisters
Step up and put yourself in the picture
This time
You know
A revolution if the only way that we can change change change
I want to fight the power
Question
Answer
Shake your hand and smile for the camera
But it's
No good
You should spend time in your neighbourhood
Where black kids
White kids
Now you're working overtime to be a crack kid
No job
No cash
A revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power
Still we don't seem to understand we need a revolution
Everybody wants a revolution
Who is
This man
I'm having trouble finding out where I'm coming from
Preconceptions
It's eternal human infection one chance
Learn how you're gonna change the habit of a lifetime my soul concerned
That revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power
Higher
Higher
Now we're gonna learn to fight the power
Sunshine
New day
I only know how to get the right way
Faster
Stronger I help my brother and my soul lives longer
Blinded
I can't see
That revolution is the only way that we can change change change
I wanna fight the power
No doubt
In time
Everything is sweet sunshine
But in the meantime
Mankind
Is having trouble where to draw the line
We still don't
Respect
And yet I thought we had intellect
Sometimes
I think
The music is the only hope we have for revolution
Still we don't seem to understand we need a revolution
Everybody needs a revolution
