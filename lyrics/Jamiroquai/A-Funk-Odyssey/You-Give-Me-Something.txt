When I met you
You were so unique
You had a little thing
I'd love to keep
Every movement
Carried much mystique
I knew right
Then I'd carry on
To you I knew
My heart belongs
You know, you
You give me something
Something that
Nobody else can give
And my heart has
Started thumping
You know now
You're the one
I truly know I dig

Like the sunbeams from
A perfect summer day
Heaven only seems
A step away
When I'm with you
I just celebrate
I'm hoping my message
Gets through
There's never been
Someone like you

I had nobody
But on you I'd lean
'Cause you got these
Little things that
I know I've never seen

You know now, you
You give me something
Something that
Nobody else has got
And this love
That I've been wanting
Oh baby's turning out
Too fast to stop

You know now (ooh)
You give me something
Something that
Nobody else can give
See my heart has
Started thumping
You know babe
You're the one
I truly know I dig

Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something

You give me something
That nobody else can give
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
You give me something
That nobody else can give
Ooh, will you give me something

Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
Ooh, will you give me something
