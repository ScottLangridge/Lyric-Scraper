2001 - where do I belong
I got my mind but I don't know where my head has gone

2001 - baby where you been
It's pornographic, internet, traffic on my screen

2001 - she's just a maniac
It's not for me but my baby really needs a crack

2001 - don't want the sex to stop
I took a pill now it's killing me to keep it up

2001 - I know what's goin' on
You wanna take my soul and change it for another one

2001 - those liquid crystal eyes, they really suit you honey
Let me get them in your size

2001 - by 2032 you can be me, and with a little luck
I can be you

2001 - let me bless you son
Help you believe with my semi-automatic gun
