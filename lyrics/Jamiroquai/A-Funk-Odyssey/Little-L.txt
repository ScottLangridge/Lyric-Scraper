There you were, freakin' out,
Tryin' to get your head around the fact,
That me and you and love is dead
See how I'm trippin' out,
'cause you can't decide what you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
'cause you make me love you,
Love you, baby,
With a little "L"

There you were, shoutin' out,
Crankin' up your altercations,
Gettin' upset in your desperation
Screamin' and hollerin',
"How can this love become so paper thin?"

You're playin' so hard to get,
You're makin' me sweat,
Just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more,
If you ain't givin' nothing to me

Don't you know that,

You make me love you,
Love you, baby,
With a little "L."
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Seems like you're steppin' on the pieces,
Of my broken shell
'cause you make me love you, love you,
With a little "L,"
You know that's the way you make me love you, yeah
