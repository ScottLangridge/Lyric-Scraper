Sometimes in the morning
When I wake up
I she'd a tear
I'm hoping
Come the night time
You open the door and reappear

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racin' when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or am I waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You.. You...
Your the one for your love I think that I would do anything
You
Your the one for your love I think that I would do anything

I miss you
I wanna kiss you
The sweet scent of roses is in your hair
See sometimes
When I get lonely
I still feel you beside me
When your not there

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or I'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You... Youuu...
Your the one for your love I think that I would do anything
Hay you you you you you
Your the one for your love I think that I would do anything

Your the one
Your the one for your love I think that would anything
You know yeah you... You... Your the one for your love
Ii think that I... I think that I would anything

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or I'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

Help me... Ohh can't you help me
I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling...
