Not in my arms, but on my mind---
Yes, on my mind, but not in my arms.
Time passes by
And I watch her fly--
Yes, I watch her fly,
And time passes by.

Though it hard for me,
I going to leave her free
ause that would be the best philosophy.
Then shel come to me.
So I feel that to be real that...

This little bird, she can fly away;
No salt on her tail---
No cage to make her stay.

Though it har d for me,
I going to leave her free
Because that would be the best philosophy.
Shel come to me.
So I feel that to be real...

This little bird she can fly away;
No salt on her tail.
No, she can fly away...
(No cage to make her stay)
No cage to maker her stay...
(No cage to make her stay)
This little bird can fly away...
(No cage to make her stay)
(No cage to make her stay)
