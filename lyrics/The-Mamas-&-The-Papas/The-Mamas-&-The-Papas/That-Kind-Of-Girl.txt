That kind of girl would let you down;
That kind of girl will always run around.
That kind of girl the kind that
You always fall for, my friend;
Your love is really a dull bore.

Imagine your surprise
When you look in her eyes
And, baby, she not there;
She freaking out somewhere,
And you think it unfair;
Well, don be so square.

That kind of girl won try to please;
That kind of girls would never get on her knees.
That knid of girl the kind that thinks just of herself;
Your on your first and she on her twelfth.
Imagine what youl find when you opern her mind
And there nothing inside that should have made you cry;
She didn have to lie and Il tell you why---
She one of those girls...
Just one of those girls (yeah).

Imagine what youl find when you open her mind
And there nothing inside that should have made you cry;
She didn have to lie and Il tell you why---

That kind of girl is just too strange;
That kind of girl ain ever gonna change.
That kind of girl the kind that makes you dizzy;
Youl always ask and wonder who is he.
She one of those girls...
She one of those girls...
She one of those girls...
She one of those girls...
