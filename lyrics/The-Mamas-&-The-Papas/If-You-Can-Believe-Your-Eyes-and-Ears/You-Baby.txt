(P.F. Sloan--Steve Barri)
From the time I fall asleep till the morning comes I dream about you baby.
And I feel alright, ause I know tonight Il be with you baby.
And who makes me feel like smiling when the weary day is through?
(Who?) You baby, you. (I talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you.
(Who?) You baby, you. (Baby, yeah.)
No one but you, you baby--nobody but you.

They say candy is sweet, but it just can compete with you, baby.
Youe got everything I need and nobody can please like you, you baby.
And who believes that my wildest dreams and my craziest schemes will come true?
(Who?) You baby, you! (I talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you.
(Who?) You baby, you! (Baby, yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you.

A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul,
Add just a touch of magic, it the greatest thing since rock n? roll.
Yeah, baby
(You) You baby, you! (I talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you.
(You) You baby, you.
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
