Hey, girl, I know he put you down
For every new love that he has found.
Hey, girl, I know your feelin? sad---
Sad and blue.
And you think the trouble not in him;
The trouble in you. (No!)

I know he only tryin? to score.
Ie seen him, Ie seen him breakin? hearts before.
Don try to put him down.
(Don let him get you down.)
He the boy I want around
(He not the only boy around)
And you---you shouldn be so blue.

I know therel be another time.
But Il be his.
(No, youl be mine.)

Sad and blue!

(Don let him get you down)
He the boy I want around and you.
(You know Il always be around.)
And you---you shouldn be so blue.
