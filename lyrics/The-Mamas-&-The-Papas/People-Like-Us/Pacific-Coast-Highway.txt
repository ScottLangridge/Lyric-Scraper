Rollin?along Pacific Coast Highway---
Bummin?along to my radio.
Saw a blond hitchin?my way;
Rolled up and said "How far do you wanna go?"
She been hummin? thumbin? hitchin?and wishin?br> For a good day on Pacific Coast Highway.

Looked in at me; and when I could see her,
She seemed to be somebody I ought to know.
Opened the door; sat down beside me.
Then with a roar, we started to roll.
She been hummin? thumbin? hitchin?and wishin?br> For a good day on Pacific Coast Highway.

Looked like a swan, but brown as Chuck Berry---
A summer dawn, yeah, light as a fairy.
We got to town; she said her name was Mary.
She been hit, she been whipped,
She been hummin? she been bummin?all her life.
(On the highway--On and on)
(On the highway--On and on)
