First star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight.

A banker daughter or a runaway girl,
A little lady or a honky-tonk Pearl
Has to find someplace in this world
Where she feels at home.
A banker daughter is so hard to deceive;
A little lady is so hard to please.
Honky-tonk Pearl wears her heart on her sleeve,
And her heart will not grow cold.

First star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight.

Here a wish for a runaway girl;
Here a prayer for honky-tonk Pearl---
Hope she finds someplace outta this world
Where she feels at home.

First star I see tonight,
I wish I may, I wish I might...
First star (first star)
I see tonight (I see tonight)
I wish I may, I wish I might...
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight.
