Hey, did somebody break your heart
With a careless word?
Did someone tear your life apart
Never knowing you were hurt?
Or did somebody try to break you in two
For a laugh, to see what you would do?
Well, if someone broke your heart, let me fix it up for you.

Anyone could look into your eyes (anyone...)
And see what youe been through.
But now youe got to realize,
There just one broken heart, not two.
It only happening to you, it true.
Don you know what he would do?
He out having some fun
While you stay at home, having none.
He doesn even know; he doesn even care.
It doesn even matter if youe even there.

Step out, step out on him tonight.
Step out, step out, step out with me, now.
Let me fix it up for you.
Step out, step out, step out on him, girl.
Step out, step out with me, now.
Let me fix it up for you.

He doesn even know; he doesn even care.
It doesn even matter if youe even there.
Tonight...
Step out, step out with me, girl;
Let me fix it up for you.
Step out, step out, step out...
