Sing for your supper, and youl get breakfast;
Songbirds always eat
If their song is sweet to hear.
Sing for your luncheon, and youl get dinner---
Dine with wine of choice
If romance is in your voice.

I heard from wise canary,
Trilling makes a fellow willing;
So, little swallow, swallow now.
Now is the time to
Sing for your supper and youl get breakfast.
Songbirds are not dumb;
They don buy a crumb of bread,
It said...
So sing and youl be fed.

Songbirds are not dumb;
They never buy a crumb of bread,
It is said...
So sing, and youl be fed, oh yeah---
Just sing and youl be fed.
