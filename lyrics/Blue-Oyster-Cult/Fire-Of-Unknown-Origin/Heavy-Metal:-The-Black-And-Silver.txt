Into the whirlpool
Where matter vanishes
Degenerate star
Arm of Orion
An iron sun
The forbidden circle
Anti-matter is the
Black horizon

Heavy metal
Black and silver
Fallen matter
Of the sun
Pours itself
Into a place
Where there was never
Never one

By starlight
The heaviest will rise up
Magnetic mirror
Scattered bodies slow
All chaos of matter
River of fire
A night sea crossing
The cosmic fluid flows

Heavy metal
Black and silver
Fallen matter
Of the sun
Pours itself
Into a place
Where there was never
Never one

Fallen matter
From the cross
Freedom
That was never lost
Beyond being
Will be coming
Beyond time, space and control

Direction........ Starlight
Creation......... Starbright
Foundation....... We forged the Einstein bridge tonight
Spans a river.... Starlight
We call time..... Starbright
World............ Light of darkness
Without end...... Light of light

Heavy metal
Black and silver
Fallen matter
Of the sun
Pours itself
Into a place
Where there was never, never, never, never one
