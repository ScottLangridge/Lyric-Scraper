Along the world axis
The empress lay sleeping
To the rhyme of the, of the, of the star clock
Seven sleepers
Seven sages
Seven ladders to the, to the
Seventh heaven

Seven stars
Had ursa major
Tables turning, turning
And rain maker
While the seven
The visitors
All went, all went
A drumming

Dance a don pedro
Do the don pedro
Games after death
Night dances 'round
Samedi and petre
In alchemy

Salute the four quarters
Before I leave your eyes
Twinned in the mirror
Les mesteres come
End me adoration
Before I leave your eyes
World in the mirror
Waters of amnesia come

Do you know (do you know), do you know (do you know)
Do you know (do you know), do you know (do you know)
The court of eve
Beneath the polar mountain
Rose cross and crosser there
Symbols of the swan
Aerial races
In rotation over
The magical casement
Visions of a parallel world

Dance a don pedro
Do the don pedro
Games after death
Night dances 'round
Samedi and petre
In alchemy
