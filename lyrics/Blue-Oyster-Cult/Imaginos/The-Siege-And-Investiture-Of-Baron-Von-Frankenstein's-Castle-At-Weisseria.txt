On the terminal point
Of the cul-de-sac
Patients are dying
The horses are dazed
From the glare of stars
The starry wisdom
Owned by the Baron
And he's got the cure

A drug by the name of World Without End
A drug by the name of World Without End
A drug by the name of World Without End

Come and take this................. Carpe Diem!
World without end.................. Carpe Diem!
You'll be inventor................. Carpe Diem!
Invention, letter, earth, wind..... Carpe Diem!
Rhymed like the real............... Carpe Diem!
And real as the rhyme.............. Carpe Diem!
Imagine this Baron................. Carpe Diem!
Inventor of rhymes................. Carpe Diem!

Imagine he was me and I was called Frankenstein
Imagine he was me and I was called Frankenstein
Imagine he was me and I was called Frankenstein

Carpe Diem!
Carpe Diem!
Carpe Diem!
Carpe Diem!

He was me, and I was called Frankenstein
He was me, and I was called Frankenstein
He was me, and I was called Frankenstein
Frankenstein

(World without end)
Frankenstein
(World without end)
Frankenstein

(World without end) ...
