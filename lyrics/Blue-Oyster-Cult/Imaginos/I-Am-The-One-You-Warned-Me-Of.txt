Fresh from zones of moisture
And afterwards the meat
With spangles on my long-tailed suits
And songs to haunt the one that's saved

Just call me desdinova
I'm sure to be
The lucky one
When destiny assigns wisdom
Known to me
The starry wisdom

I am the one you warned me of
I am the one who'd never, never lie

The writing in the notebook
Notation from the stars
Songs by desdinova
And frost warnings from the women's farm
Whose agents could not ever see
His hilly eyes and too green rings
Obscured sight and fancy dreams
Holy mass, those 13 fancy dreams

I am the one you warned me of
I am the one who'd never, never lie

Eyes like bottles and hands in my hair
Bottles of blackness the blacker the spare
I'll sit myself behind that clock
And play tunes on it's belfry

Five fingers have I to play them like ten
Ten fingers have I to play them again
In decimal chains whose mimic cry
Whose notes will never, never fly
Until they quit those timely tunes
And entered that system from outside

I am the one you warned me of
I am the one who'd never, never lie
