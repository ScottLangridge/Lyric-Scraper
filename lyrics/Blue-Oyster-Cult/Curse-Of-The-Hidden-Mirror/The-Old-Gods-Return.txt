Now is the time the moon is in alignment
With the unknown zodiac, the untold sign
Of the fiery maniac within each breast
Awaits a stirring irridescent whirring
Of a six eyed god whose wings beat
In a time so odd, so very odd
And we're all lost, all of us blessedly lost

Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever

Now is the time the old gods return
Now is the time the old gods return
Exactly when the world is not expecting it
Exactly when we're sure of ourselves
That's exactly when the old gods return
And sweep our cities back into hell

Now is the time that the old gods return
Now is the time that water begins to burn
Now is the time that the apes take wing
And we recognize them from that Oz thing
And we realize it was a prophecy
We realize it was a prophecy
Yeah the old gods laugh, it amuses them
The old gods laugh

Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever

Now is the time the old gods return
Now is the time the old gods return
Exactly when the world is not expecting it
Exactly when we're sure of ourselves
That's exactly when the old gods return
Amd sweep our cities...
And sweep our cities back into hell

Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever and ever
Forever forever and ever

Now is the time the old gods return
Now is the time the old gods return
Now is the time the old gods return
Now is the time the old gods return
