Its good to feel hungry when youre about to eat well
Its good to be angry when youre ready to yell
Its good to be angry
Its good to feel certain even when youre not right
Sweep back the curtain and let in some light
If there is any light
She calls me, she summons me with a purr
And no amount of cryin' will set me free from her
And only deep feeling, finding my way into feeling
Only just being, will free me from her
Sometimes I flirt with despair, as if she were a lady
A pale and black-haired lady
A cool and bloodless lady, yeah
Good to feel, good to feel its good to feel damn good to feel
Good to feel, its good to feel, its good to feel damn good to feel
Its good to feel, its good to feel, its good to feel damn good to feel
Its good to feel, its good to feel, its good to feel damn good to feel
Damn good to feel
Damn good to feel
Damn good to feel
