There is a box that I have shown
And in the box the games of god
There is a fox that I have known
And in its heart the blood is hard
Its heart is but a stone
There is a chain that I have worn
And on the chain a thorn is hung
There is a pain forever borne
That sings a song forever sung
The song is but a stone
Stone of love
Stone of love
Stone of love
Stone of love
There is a ledge beside a dome
And on the ledge adventures dance
There is an edge that is your home
And on the edge breathes true romance
There is a voice without a sound
Whose wisdom speaks in foolish rhyme
There is a choice that I have found
Between the fear and safer time
The choice is but a stone
Stone of love
Stone of love
Stone of love
Stone of love
