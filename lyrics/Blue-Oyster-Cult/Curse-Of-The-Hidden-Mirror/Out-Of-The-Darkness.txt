Out of the darkness out of the dustcloud
Follow the thread and then trace your way free
Your father, your mother have bound you in darkness
Have blinded you sweetly and so far from me
They cannot abide me, your father and mother
But they cannot divide me from the one other than me
Only one other, only one other
Only one other has meaning for me
Now come to the window, now wipe away raindrops
See there a scarecrow who waves through the mist
I am that dim form, I raise my right hand
A rag in a rainstorm, the chance that you've missed
The door opens both ways, the door opens outward
My heart contains always the one time we kissed
Only one other, only one other
Only one other has meaning for me
Only one other beside my own soul
You are that other with meaning for me
Your mother, your father, they live in their heart break
They remember each other and they turn you from me
Your mother, your father they hate me for your sake
But they cannot divide us, no I won't let it be
I am that dim form, I raise my right hand
A rag in a rainstorm, the chance that you've missed
The door opens both ways, the door opens outward
My heart contains always the one time we kissed
The only one other, only one other
Only one other has meaning for me
Only one other beside my own soul
You are that other with meaning for me
The only one other, only one other
Only one other has meaning for me
Only one other beside my own soul
You are that other with meaning for me
