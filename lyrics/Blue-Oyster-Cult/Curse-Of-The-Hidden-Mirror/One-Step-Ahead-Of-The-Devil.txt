You hear the hounds awailin
As if the mountains groan
You hear the lonesome echo, the telltale clack of stones
You thought youd get away, but you're never quite alone
You hear the hiss of rattler, maracas on his tail
You hear the lion replyin to the stalker on your trail
One step ahead of the devil one step
One step ahead of the man one step
Youre one step ahead of evil
And you can only run as far as you can
One step ahead of the devil one step
One step ahead of the man one step
Youre one step ahead of evil
And you can only run as far as you can
And you can only run as far as you can
And you can only run as far as you can
You hear the darkness weeping
For those who fall tonight
That night you lay beside her, for once you almost slept
Until her slim blade glimmered near got you 'fore you leapt
Wish you could leave her livin but that's like guns and rust
You don't want it on your gun, it's just like you and trust
One step ahead of the devil one step
One step ahead of the man one step
Youre one step ahead of evil
And you can only run as far as you can
One step ahead of the devil one step
One step ahead of the man one step
Youre one step ahead of evil
And you can only run as far as you can
And you can only run as far as you can
And you can only run as far as you can
Somewhere, there's a refuge
Somewhere, a place to rest
Somewhere, there's a lover
Someday you'll pass the test
One step ahead of the devil one step
One step ahead of the man one step
Youre one step ahead of evil
And you can only run as far as you can
One step ahead of the devil one step
One step ahead of the man one step
Youre one step ahead of evil
And you can only run as far as you can
And you can only run as far as you can
And you can only run as far as you can
