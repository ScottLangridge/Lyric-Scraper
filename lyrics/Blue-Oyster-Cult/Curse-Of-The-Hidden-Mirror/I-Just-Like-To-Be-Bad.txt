I knew her when she was a secretary
She always refused to get married
She tried not to smile or meet your eyes
She knew if she did you'd start those lies
I busted a sweat every day on the dock
She sang to herself as she worked for the boss
She'd process words to the dance music station
Every stroke of her fingers an invitation
She said I just like to be bad
First names only and one night stands
I just like to be bad
Forget the face, I want the hands
And I kept trying whisperin slow and special
Something eternal and something essential
I don't give up but I aint a stalker
I guess I'm just an easy talker
She said I just like to be bad
First names only and one night stands
I just like to be bad
Forget the face, I want the hands
And I made sure that I held her gaze
And I made sure she couldn't look away
And I put aside all those tired old lies
She read the truth, see it in my eyes
She said I just like to be bad
First names only and one night stands
I just like to be bad
Forget the face, I want the hands
But only for you I just like to be bad
But only for you I just like to be bad
But only for you I just like to be bad
I wanna be there for you I just like to be bad
I wanna be there for you I just like to be bad
I wanna be there for you, babe I just like to be bad
I wanna be there for you I just like to be bad
I wanna be for only you I just like to be bad
