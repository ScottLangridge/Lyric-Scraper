Drivin alone into the darkness
I heard you call my name
And the roar of the engine
Is calling me to blame
Tears in my mirror cryin' for the people behind us
But I know I wont let you go, oh no
Here comes that feeling again
I'm wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is healin again
After all weve been through
And I know theres a place inside of my heart
That the road will never find
And I'm afraid the approaching headlights
Will someday leave me blind
You shatter the mirror
Fight off the forces that drive me on tonight
I wont let you go, oh no
Here comes that feeling again
I'm wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is healin again
After all weve been through
Baby, climb into the night time
Girl, this moment is the right time
Drivin' on and I'm still hungry
To make the next town
And this roads the only
Thing that could bring us down
If it keeps me driving
I swear ill never leave you behind
And I know I can't let you go, oh no
Here comes that feeling again
I'm wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is healin again
After all weve been through
Here comes that feeling again
Here comes that feeling again
