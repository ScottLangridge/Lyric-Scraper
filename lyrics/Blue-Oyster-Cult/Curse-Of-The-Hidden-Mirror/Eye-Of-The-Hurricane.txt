Eye Of The Hurricane

Sometimes I let it take me like a greased and vertical sled
I know the trick won't break me, it's all dancing in my head

People think that they can change most people it ain't true
It's easy to talk about change, ain't easy followin' through

Once it starts, it has to finish, once it rolls, it's gonna crash
You know it finds it's limit, today's heroes tomorrow's trash

He never blinks, he never blinks, he doesn't care what you think
Cause there's an eye in my hurricane
There's an eye in my hurricane
There's something calm watching in the center of me
Cause there's an eye to my hurricane

People fly around me like dead leaves in high wind
They stream down the choking streets and never quite reach the end

Sometimes I wear a blue buzzsaw, I wear it like mohawk steel
Sometimes I ride my fatal flaw blindfolded, do it by feel

He never blinks, he never blinks, he doesn't care what you think
Cause there's an eye in my hurricane
There's an eye in my hurricane
There's something calm watching in the center of me
Cause there's an eye to my hurricane

Sometimes I wear a blue buzzsaw, I wear it like mohawk steel
Sometimes I ride my fatal flaw blindfolded, do it by feel

He never blinks, he never blinks, he doesn't care what you think
Cause there's an eye in my hurricane
There's an eye in my hurricane
There's something calm watching in the center of me
Cause there's an eye to my hurricane
There's an eye to my hurricane
There's an eye to my hurricane
There's an eye to my hurricane
