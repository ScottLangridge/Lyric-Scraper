Come on come on
To the station of night
Come on come on
Everybody's waiting
Come on come on
With the signal in sight
Come on come on
There's a new tune playing

Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Who will rock with you....... Oh woman will you

Come on come on to the cities of night
Come on come on everybody's praying
Come on come on for the wonder of light
Come on come on there's a new day breaking

Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Who will rock with you....... Oh woman will you

I ain't gonna catch those countdown blues
I ain't gonna catch those countdown blues
I ain't gonna catch those countdown blues
I only live to be born again
I only live to be born again
I only live to be born again

Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Are you ready to rock?....... Yes I am
Who will rock with you....... I know now
Who will rock with you....... I see somebody
Who will rock with you....... Somebody like you
Who will rock with you....... Yeah
