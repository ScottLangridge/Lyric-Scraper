Bleached by the sun
And scorched by the moon
If I make it 'til tomorrow noon I'm leaving

'tween the horror of space
And the terror of time
My heart in crystal down the line I'm screaming

What I need is a kiss from you babe
Before it's hangover time
What I need is some love from you babe
Before this stampede arrives

Desolate landscape
Storybook bliss
My darling let me tell you this - it's crazy

Hell of a memory
Is a heaven of pain
Snow is cold but so is rain please save me

What I need is a kiss from you babe
Before it's hangover time
What I need is some love from you babe
Before this stampede arrives

Oh babe.......................what I need kiss from you babe
Before it's hangover time.....what I need love from you babe
Before this stampede arrives

Babe..........................what I need  death valley nights
Babe babe...................what I need  death valley nights
Babe..........................what I need
I need you....................death valley nights
Before I lose my mind

I need you....................what I need death valley nights
What I need
To run away...................death valley nights
Get away......................what I need
Outer space...................death valley nights
Just run away.................what I need
I need you....................death valley nights
