I've been searching, searching, searching for celine
I've been searching, searching for her company
Find her where she's working
Find her where she hides
I know why she's cursing
She knows why I lie

I've been searching, searching, searching for celine
I've been searching, searching for her company
Find her where she's sleeping
I know why she's tired
I know why she's cursing
She knows why I lie

She said
"love is like a gun
And in the hands of someone like you
I think it'd kill
But oh, what a thrill
Oh, what a thrill
No oh!

I've been talking, talking, talking in my sleep
I've been talking, talking, talking to celine
Talking 'bout your love
Talking 'bout your love
Talking 'bout your love
Do you know what I said?

I said
"love is like a gun
And in the hands of someone like you
I think it'd kill
But oh, what a thrill
Oh, what a thrill
Oh oh!
