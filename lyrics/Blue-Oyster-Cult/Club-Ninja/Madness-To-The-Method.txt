A rock through a window never comes with a kiss.
Rhyme and a reason never argue with a fist.
There's a time for discussion and a time for a fight.
It's the time in the season for a maniac at night.

There's a lot to be said for a blow to the head.
So come on! Make a show! Turn it on! Let it go!
Put some madness to the method!    [We need! We need! We need! We need!]
We need madness to the method!     [Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
We want madness to the method!     [We need! We need! We need! We need!]
We need madness to the method!     [Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
We don't care as long as there's some madness!

The member's only lacking with the stage cologne.
Try to pacify the jackal at the watering hole.
The boys want to mix in with the girls at the bar.
And the dream doesn't wait when there's no one in the car.

Babe, is there a mission to destroy your inhibitions?
So come on! Get some show! Hang it out! Rock and roll!
Put some madness to the method!    [We need! We need! We need! We need!]
We need madness to the method!     [Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
We want madness to the method!     [We need! We need! We need! We need!]
We need madness to the method!     [Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
We don't care as long as there's some madness!

[Instrumental]

It's a hormone war zone - boys are out for a fight;
Wenches in the trenches on a Saturday night.
Stick it here, stick it there; get it out of sight.
It's the time in the season for the nasty things at night.

Put some madness to the method!    [We need! We need! We need! We need!]
We need madness to the method!     [Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
We want madness to the method!     [We need! We need! We need! We need!]
We need madness to the method!     [Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
[Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
[Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
[Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
[Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]
[Revolt! Revolt! Revolt! Revolt!]

[Instrumental]
