(- Larry Gottlieb - Jason Scanlon -)
Tomorrow soon turns into yesterday.
Everything we see just fades away.
There's sky and sand where mountains used to be.
Time drops by a second to eternity.
It doesn't matter if we turn to dust;
Turn and turn and turn we must!
I guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!
Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!

There's laughter where I used to see your tears.
It's all done with mirrors, have no fears.
There's nothing pure or sacred in our time.
The nights we spent together are no crime.
It doesn't matter if we turn to dust;
Turn and turn and turn we must!
I guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!
Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!

Like marble statues always flowing lay,
From castles built in silence, let us play.
Even though our skulls rot in our flesh.
We can build a laser, tear the mesh.
It doesn't matter if we turn to dust;
Turn and turn and turn we must.
I guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!
Dancin' in the ruins!
