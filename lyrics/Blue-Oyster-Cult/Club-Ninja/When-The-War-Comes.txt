"when the bones of our oppressors have turned to dust;
And the cause that we serve rules the world.
In a vision, visitation, all hail the revolution! "

A vision of evo-, revolution.
Armies of the past retreat in the wake of revolution.
A journey to the country of the fourth admission,
A spectacle of awakening light.
The soldiers are baffled but still they fight.

Creator; destroyer; victory; defeat;
I did not come to bring a sleep.
Black flag; red flag; space and time;
The future is my mind.

Judgement day descends upon us after the revolution.
The purge has come to set you free;
On the lips, the light called truth.
A modest time for victory.
Energy imprisoned will make itself free.

Creator; destroyer; victory; defeat;
I did not come to bring a sleep.
Black flag; red flag; space and time;
The future is my mind.

When the war comes... When the war comes...
When the war comes... When the war comes...
War comes... When the war comes...
