( - Bob Halligan, Jr. - )
Come with me! Ready or not!
You got to jump to the music!
Come with me! It's gonna get hot!
You got the rhythms to use it!
Not everybody cooperates, and I'll say if they wanna play rough:
Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!

Come with me! And reach for the sky!
Get your fists up where I can see 'em!
Come with me! Dead or alive!
Hey! I want to hear everybody screaming!
Some people got a bad attitude, and I'll say if they wanna act tough:
Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!

You take a lickin'; keep on kickin';
This fight we both can win!
We'll stop sockin' when you stop rockin'!
You don't give up, you just give in!

Not everybody cooperates, and I'll say if they wanna act tough:
Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!
Beat 'em up! You know you got to beat 'em up!
Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!
Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!
