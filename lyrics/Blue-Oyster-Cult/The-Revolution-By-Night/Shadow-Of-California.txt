Beneath the freeway at the cloverleaf junction
A symbol of good luck eminates darkness
The shadow will grow to cover california
Somewhere on the road from san bernadino
Its future is steering the past... Will not pass

Speed is the game in the shadow of kings
Where the company of angels fly
They appear at the crossroads at once in the future
Clad in the darkness on the highways of night
With no love... From the past

Night makes right
The symbol remains
Into the darkness
Must pour the brains
In the shadow of california

Revolution by night grant me this future
Kings of the shadow on the highways of night
From san bernadino these angels are racing
This night to your city
The host of angels... Los angeles

Night makes right
The symbol remains
Into the darkness
Must pour the brains
In the shadow of california
