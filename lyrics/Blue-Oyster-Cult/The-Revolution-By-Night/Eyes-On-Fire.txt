(- G. Winter -)
At the stroke of midnight staring at the phone
For the millionth time I'm all alone
I'm the guy she turns to when her lovers leave
I'm the wild card she's got up her sleeve
But she don't look at me
With eyes on fire glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes burning with love and desire

I'm like a long lost brother, I'm closer than a friend
The only one on whom she can depend
She thinks I'm sweet and gentle, she thinks the world of me
But late at night I'm not the one she needs
She never looks at me
With eyes on fire glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes burning with love and desire

Don't you don't you see I'm cryin' out loud
Can't she tell I need her now?

Jam

She never looks at me
With eyes on fire glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes burning with love and desire
With eyes on fire glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes burning with love and desire
Eyes on fire Hungry eyes...
