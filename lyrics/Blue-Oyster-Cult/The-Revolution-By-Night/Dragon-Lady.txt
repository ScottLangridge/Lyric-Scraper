Out of the smoke at the dawn of man
Out of the ocean across the sand
Reaching forth with her ancient hand
Dragon lady

Out of the flames of a man's desire
A hair-raising voice from an evil choir
Reigning down like a freezing fire
Dragon lady

She appears mysteriously
You don't take her seriously
Until you're under her spell

Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Try to run but before you start
Dragon lady's got you by the heart
Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Dragon lady's got you
She won't let go

Terrible lightning flashes across the sky
When the dragon lady shows you how to fly
Terrible lightning flashes across the sky
When the dragon lady shows you how to cry

Out of the cage in the center ring
Out of the crowd and straight to the king
Who's out of his mind with her mystical thing
Dragon lady

Out of the dream and into the night
A final look makes you die of fright
No one there in the candle light
Dragon lady

She appears outrageously
You take her courageously
Until you're under her spell

Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Dragon lady takes you by the heart
Try to run but before you start
Dragon lady's got you by the heart
Dragon lady takes you by the heart
The dragon lady's got you
And she won't let go

Terrible lightning flashes across the sky
When the dragon lady shows you how to fly
Terrible lightning flashes across the sky
And the dragon lady's laughing as you die
