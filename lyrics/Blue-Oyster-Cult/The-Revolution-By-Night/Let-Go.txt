Hell-bent for leather on a moonlit night
There's a hot wind blowin'
Better hold on tight to your soul

Blue fire rising up from the deep
Burning the world when it's tryin' to sleep

So let go
Let go
Let go

Let go
Let go
Let go
C'mon let yourself go

Boc
You can be whatever you want to be
You've got the power
We've got the key
Yeah, boc

You're a rebel and you got no friends
We all know that it all depends on rock and roll

Do you feel like they're keeping you down
Ain't no fun with your feet on the ground

So let go
Let go
Let go

Let go
Let go
Let go
Yeah let yourself go

Boc
You can be whatever you want to be
You've got the power
We've got the key
Boc

Gimme guitar, buck dharma
