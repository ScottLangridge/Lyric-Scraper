I plot your rubric scarab,
I steal your satellite
I want your wife to be my
Baby tonight, baby tonight

I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking
I'm making a career of evil

Pay me I'll be your surgeon
I'd like to pick your brain
Capture you inject you
Leave you kneeling in the rain
Kneeling in the rain

I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking
I'm making a career of evil

I'd like your blue eyed horseshoe,
I'd like your emerald horny toad
I'd like to do it to your daughter on a dirt road

And then I'd spend your ransom money,
But still I'd keep your sheep
I'd peel the mask you're wearing,
And then rob you of your sleep
Rob you of your sleep

I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking
I'm making a career of evil
