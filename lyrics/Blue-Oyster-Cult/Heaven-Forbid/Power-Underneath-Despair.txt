You boys are surprised to see me
Never thought Id get out of jail
Took eight long years to spring me
And two hours to ride the rail
Took only thirty minutes to find you
Asking every snake slithering the street
Wheres the man with the golden tattoo?
The man who let me take the heat?
Youre surprised in your neon lair
By the power underneath despair
Power underneath
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
Power underneath Theres a power
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
Power underneath Theres a power
Power underneath Yeah the
Power underneath despair
Power underneath Theres a power
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
In solitary for two steel years
Thought of you sixty times an hour
Fighting madness and fighting despair
Digging the hidden power
Thought about you in the yard
When your punk slipped me the blade
Thought about you in the hospital ward
When I gave it back to him in trade
And my smile is the last sight youll see
As you feel the power from inside of me
Power underneath
Power underneath Theres a
Power underneath despair
Power underneath
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
Power underneath Theres a power
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
Power underneath
Power underneath Theres a
Power underneath despair
Power underneath
Power underneath Theres a
Power underneath despair
Power underneath
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
Power underneath Theres a power
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
Power underneath Theres a
Power underneath
Power underneath despair
