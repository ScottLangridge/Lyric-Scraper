This place has a history
The Spaniards settled here
They burned the town and fields
They moved away from here
My grandma often told me
She knew it peaceful here
The war took all the vigor
War took the best from here

Ahh ahh ahh ahh When the wind turns
Ahh ahh ahh ahh And blows the leaves from the trees
Ahh ahh ahh ahh Harvest moon

I see the days grow shorter
I feel the nights grow cold Harvest moon
Young people feelin' restless
Old people feelin' old Harvest moon
I sense the darkness clearer
I feel a presence here Harvest moon
A change in the weather
I love this time of year Harvest moon

The Cobys worked that valley
They gave that land a go
They built a thriving business
Then came that early snow
They lost their livestock that year
They lost their sheep and goats
They sold the farm in springtime
Went south to work the boats

Ahh ahh ahh ahh When the wind turns
Ahh ahh ahh ahh And blows the leaves from the trees
Ahh ahh ahh ahh Harvest moon

I see the days grow shorter
I feel the nights grow cold Harvest moon
Young people feelin' restless
Old people feelin' old Harvest moon
I sense the darkness clearer
I feel a presence here Harvest moon
A change in the weather
I love this time of year Harvest moon

Ten years in this farmhouse
Ten years come this May
My simple needs are covered
Since grandma passed away
Long time since there's been trouble
That's what the people say
I told the new man when I
Sold the farm today

Ahh ahh ahh ahh When the wind turns
Ahh ahh ahh ahh And blows the leaves from the trees
Ahh ahh ahh ahh Harvest moon

I sense the darkness clearer
I feel a presence here Harvest moon
A change in the weather
I feel some evil here Harvest moon
I hear some frightful noises
I don't go out at night Harvest moon
Since Bobrow's youngest daughter
Disappeared from sight Harvest moon

I know they'll find her some day
They find them all that way Harvest moon
After the thaw in springtime
The snow melts away Harvest moon
I see the days grow shorter
I feel the nights grow cold Harvest moon
Young people feelin' restless
Old people feelin' old Harvest moon
