Wish I was a better person
With more control
Turn the other cheek
When the punch comes, roll
Wish I was a kinder person
Could see the others pain
Not overreact, never judge
Shrug off the spreadin stain
But Im a howler monkey
Moreaus half & half-man
A panther with its tail in a trap
A pumped up pyramid of pulsing glands
Im damaged, and I like it
It made me what I am
Im damaged, and I like it
The rest is just a sham
Im damaged, and I like it
I live for rock n roll
Im damaged, and I like it
It thrills me to the soul
Yeah, I told girlfriend I was gonna change
Gonna kick the habit and the taste
Trust me baby, this time its real
Theres a big part of me Ive yet to waste
Dont give up baby, dont turn your back
I aint no wailin lost cause
Ill toss the pipe and heal the tracks
As long as you dont mind the blood
On my hands, drippin down the back thats right
Im damaged, and I like it
It made me what I am
Im damaged, and I like it
The rest is just a sham
Im damaged, and I like it
I live for rock n roll
Im damaged, and I like it
It thrills me to the soul
D-a-m-a-g-e-d damaged is what I am
D-a-m-a-g-e-d damaged is what I am
D-a-m-a-g-e-d damaged is what I am
D-a-m-a-g-e-d
What I am
And I like it
I live for rock n roll
Im damaged, and I like it
It thrills me to the soul
Im damaged, and I like it
It made me what I am
Im damaged, and I like it
The rest is just a sham
Yeah!
Go!
