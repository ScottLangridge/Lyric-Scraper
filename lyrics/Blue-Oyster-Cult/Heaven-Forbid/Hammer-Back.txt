Step into a world of strangers
Into a sea of unknowns
Even friends potential danger
Secrets wound around their bones
Everybody else has got one
Packin high caliber heat
If you don't wanna be dancin
You don't dare miss the beat
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Don't keep the safety on
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Til the living shadows gone
Maybe at a Seven-Eleven
Maybe at a quick carjack
Youll verify there aint a heaven
If you don't keep the hammer back
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Don't keep the safety on
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Til the living shadows gone
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Don't keep the safety on
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Til the living shadows gone
Hammer back, hammer back
Don't keep the safety on
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Til the living shadows gone
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Don't keep the safety on
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Til the living shadows gone
Keep the hammer back, hammer back
Hammer back, hammer back
Ha ha ha
