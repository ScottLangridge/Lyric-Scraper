It was a wet night
And the other guy
Was lubricated with a pint of Jack
His truck hit
Jimmys chevy
With a sound like a thunder crack
I was working late but I felt it happen
I knew that my brother was laid low
I waited for the call
And then the damn call came
And I knew what I knew and didn't want to know
Live for me
Live for me
Live twice as big
Love twice as long
Work twice as hard
Play all of your cards
Live for me
Live for me
Burn twice as bright
Three times as long
But brother, don't do no one wrong
Beth thought he would make it through the winter
I never really thought so myself
The dark spirit was always hoverin nearer
And I knew in my heart there was just no help
When he called me to the bed
Took my hand to say goodbye
He said he wouldnt blame nobody
Said he wouldnt ask the Lord why
And when he passed on
A March wind blew
Sun drew away a veil of cloud
We buried him smiling
We buried him deep
And I could hear him sayin right out loud
Live for me
Live for me
Live twice as big
Love twice as long
Work twice as hard
Play all of your cards
Live for me
Live for me
Burn twice as bright
Three times as long
But brother, don't do no one wrong
Brother, don't do no one wrong
