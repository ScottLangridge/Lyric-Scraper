Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
In the 50s Ray Milland pierced the skies
Do not envy who sees and plucks out his eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
You think you want
You want to see
Through all the lies
You think youd like
To see past death
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes
Do not envy who sees beyond the pale
don't look there, pluck not at natures veil
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
You think you want
To see the truth
But if you knew
You can't undo
Youd look away
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes
Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
