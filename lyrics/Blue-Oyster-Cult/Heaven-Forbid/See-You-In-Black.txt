I'd like to see you in black
It'd make me feel like your husband's dead
I'd like to see you in black
We could make him suffer instead

I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black

You can't lie to me Ann
You can't pretend he isn't beating you up
I saw the marks on your hands
I saw the blood on your coffee cup

I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black

The wind plucks your black lace gown
You're standin' proudly beside his grave
I see you wearing black
Gently smiling and oh so brave

We'll run away to Greece
We'll walk the ruins of the Parthenon
We'll drink ouzo in our tub
Watch the dust billow 'til the night's gone

I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd love to see you in black I'd love to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black
In black
In black
