That endless light
Casts only one shadow
The cold grey light
By the penthouse on the ghetto
Kill the other witness
Knife plunged to the hilt
The unforgiven dawn
Will only spotlight your guilt
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't lie to yourself anymore
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't hide the truth
Hide the truth anymore
You call up Emmy
Youve rehearsed the lines
But she knows about Judy
She knows youre lying
Put your foot in it, yeah
Its getting caught
Leave it in long enough, yeah
It starts to rot
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't lie to yourself anymore
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't hide the truth
Hide the truth anymore
No matter what you did
No matter who you are
In the fading light
From a middle aged star
Youve seen every blemish
Every sign of age
And its useless to whine
And its useless to rage
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't lie to yourself anymore
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't hide the truth
Hide the truth anymore
Cold grey light of dawn
You can't lie to yourself anymore
In the cold grey light of dawn
You can't hide the truth
Hide the truth anymore
Hide the truth
Anymore
Hide the truth anymore
