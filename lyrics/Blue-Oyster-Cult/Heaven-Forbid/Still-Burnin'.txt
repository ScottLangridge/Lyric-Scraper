Maraschino
Cherry lipstick
Drop dead gorgeous
To her fingertips
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
Hold me tighter
In your arms
Lets set off the
Smoke alarm
And I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
And I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin ohh ohh ohh ohh
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
Take me to the
Edge of madness
Let me feel your
Secret passion
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
Freud have mercy
On my soul
I can't fight this
Anymore
And I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
And I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin ohh ohh ohh ohh
I'm burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
I'm burnin for your love
I'm still burnin ohh ohh ohh ohh
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
I'm still burnin
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin ohh ohh ohh ohh
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
I'm burnin for your love
I'm still burnin ohh ohh ohh ohh
Burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
I'm burnin for your love
I'm still burnin
