Keep goin' getting higher
New worlds waiting in the sky
Escape the feasting and the hunger
Not the monsters in our minds

Got our hands on a ship
And stole away into the night
The four of us and pasha dear
She to steer and we to fight

Fed up with rules and regulations
No more laughter left on earth
Outer space our one salvation
May God help us in our search

We fled so fast that we grew younger
Put the ship on cruise control
We all did our best with pasha
But not as good as good ol' joe

Monsters, monsters, monsters..... In the night
Monsters, monsters, monsters..... In black and white
Monsters, monsters, monsters..... Out of control
Monsters, monsters, monsters..... When you're alone
Monsters, monsters, monsters..... Feed on themselves
Monsters, monsters, monsters..... On the road to hell

Love never should have entered
It was never in the plan
We were finally going to have her
And let joe be damned!

Joe awoke from a stupor
It was clear something was wrong
He rushed in and found us with her
And in his rage he aimed his gun

One shot and it was over
Pasha smiled and then was gone...
