There was no light shining through the window
As margaret lie in bed
She was wearing cotton pajamas
A crucifix above her head
She awoke from a dream
Her eyes were open
Her lips were moving
In the dark

Speak to me in many voices
Make them all sound like one
Let me see your sacred mysteries
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
Reveal to me the unknown tongue

She put her hands upon her breasts
And they were small and hard and young
And everywhere she touched she felt a fire
Waiting for the answer that must surely come
Is this the way to love?
Or is this just the way to die?

Speak to me in many voices
Make them all sound like one
Let me see your sacred mysteries
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
Reveal to me the unknown tongue

Then she took her father's razor
And watched it cut into her palm
She put her hand up to her mouth
To taste the blood so holy and warm
She got up in the morning
Put on her dress, and patent leather shoes
Ate her cereal and kissed her mother
Caught the bus and went to school

Speak to me in many voices
Make them all sound like one
Let me see your sacred mysteries
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
