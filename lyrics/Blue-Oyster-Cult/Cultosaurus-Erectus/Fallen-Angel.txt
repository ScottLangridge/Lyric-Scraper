From the dust I rose on high
Thunder cloud in a two-lane sky
From the world I did rebel
A fallen angel

Highway lust was in my blood
No girl could ever take my love
Cold and cruel and then I fell
A fallen angel

A girl so strange I lost my head
Lost it all got left for dead
I curse the day now I'm just a shell
A fallen angel

Gonna rise up from hell
I'm the fallen angel

When the brink of ruin lies
Upon the world angels shall rise
To lead the fallen now remember world
A fallen angel

Gonna rise up from hell
Gonna rise up from hell
Gonna rise up from hell
I'm the fallen angel
