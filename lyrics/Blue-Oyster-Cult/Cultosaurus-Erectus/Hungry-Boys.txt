Sometimes it feels like you can't get enough
My buddies and me keep looking for the stuff
To make us feel the blood rushing through our veins
Just to keep on living is bound to be a strain

We're hungry boys!
We're hungry boys!
We're hungry boys!
We're hungry boys!
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry boys!

Friday night we take off heading for the city
To dance with the lady from the white snow country
And if she takes us home and we get a little love
That's something can't get enough of

We're hungry boys!
We're hungry boys!
We're hungry boys!
We're hungry boys!
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry boys!

Now look at louie he's really got the need
Valerie's got the needle but she always makes him plead
Louie was the one who really brought the stuff to town
But the cops moved in and shot the operation down

That's why we're hungry boys!
That's why we're hungry boys!
That's why we're hungry boys!
That's why we're hungry boys!
Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry boys!
