Lonely teardrops, you been crying
I hear them fall
In the night the empty night
I hear your song
It goes right through me
It used to move me
(lonely, lonely)

Lonely paris, met a dancer
We did the stroll
Through the night the empty night
Four years ago
I thought you know me
She gave it to me
(lonely, lonely)

Chorus:
I seem to see a rose
I reach out then it goes
Now in it's thorns I roam
The sky is grey and I am cold
Lord I tell you, lord I tell you
All I want to do is get back home

Lonely teardrops, we did shoot them
They came on strong
Vials of rain to kill the pain
So far from home
I thought you knew me
You did it to me
(lonely, lonely)

Lonely teardrops, I've been cryin'
All week long
Love is willing but the bed is cold
Goodbye, laurence
I thought I knew you
What good did that do
(lonely, lonely)

Chorus:
I seem to see a rose
I reach out then it goes
Now in it's thorns I roam
You never know until you know
Lord I ask you, lord I beg you
All I want to do is get back home

Lonely teardrops (repeat)
