Dance on fire with me babe
The flames ain't gonna stop
Come on and show me
That you're ready to trot

So if you really wanna do it
You better do it hot

Ah my babe
You tell me that you're scared
But your fear
Is just driving me mad

Well, you can call me Dr. Music
Music is my game
Well, you can call me Dr. Music
Music is my name

Girl don't stop that screamin'
You're sounding so sincere
So much beauty
In the tracks of your tears

So if you wanna face the music
Open up your ears

Meet my friend
Calamity Jane
Hear the rhythm
In the sound of her pain

Well, you can call me Dr. Music
Music is my game
Well, you can call me Dr. Music
Music is my name
