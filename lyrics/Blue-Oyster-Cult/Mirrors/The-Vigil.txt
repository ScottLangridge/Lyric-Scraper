In a purple vision
Many thousand years ago
I saw the silent stranger
Walk the earth alone

Twenty-seven faces
With their eyes turned to the sky
I've got a camera
And an airtight alibi

I know they're out there
We see them coming
Faster than the speed of light
They greet us in the dead of the night

Somewhere, someday, someone
They'll be light and sound
They'll alight on the ground
On which we stand

Somewhere, someday, someone
Will help us to survive
They're gonna show us hell
And bring us back alive

Well, I'm no poet, but I can't be fooled
The lies don't count, the whispers do
I hear the whispers on the wind
They say the earth has fallen due

We run in circles
Our days are numbered
Every night I look away
To the heavens and I pray

Come to us
Come to us

Our lights are dim
Our roads are crumbling
And we don't know what to do
We're sick and tired
And dying to meet you
'cause we bit off more than
We can chew
