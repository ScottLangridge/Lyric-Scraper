Did you catch the fever
Flying toward the moon?
Sailing in space to a distant shore
You kind of wondered
What they came here for

We lived days for lovin'
Falling for all we met
A world gone crazy from the lunacy
The tides kept rising and falling
Like you and me

Moon crazy
Summer of changes
Let the night shine on (and on) and on
Shine on until the feeling is gone
Dreaming about, what could it be
Summer's embraces
Had a hold on me

On the hill they danced 'til dawn
While the video flickered along
But in your heart was an empty need
You just didn't know
Where the dream would lead

Moon crazy
Summer of changes
Let the night shine on (and on) and on
Shine on, shine on

Moon crazy
Summer of changes
Let the night shine on (and on) and on
Shine on until the feeling is gone
Dreaming about, what could it be
Summer's embraces
Had a hold on me

Moon crazy
Summer of madness
Let the night shine on (and on) and on
Shine on until the feeling is gone
Dreaming about, what could it be
Summer's embraces
Had a hold on me
