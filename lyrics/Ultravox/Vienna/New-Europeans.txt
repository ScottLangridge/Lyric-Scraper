A photograph of lovers lost lies pressed in magazines
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen
Their educated son has left in search of borrowed dreams
His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen

On a crowded beach washed by the sun, he puts his headphones on
His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song
Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away
He's a European legacy, a culture for today
