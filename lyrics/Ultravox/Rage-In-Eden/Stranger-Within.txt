Light gets through a crack in the door
I tape up the windows once more
Tight like a cold hand of fear
Don't fear the stranger within

Hands that petrify in the air
Eyes catching things never there
Sweet tension caught on my breath
Don't fear the stranger within

Watch every shape that escapes
Scared to make that final mistake
Speak to hear the sound of your voice
Don't fear the stranger within

Sit in the corner with your back to the wall
Pray to your God with your head in your hands
Your mask of fear is shrinking fast
It's closing in more and more

You stand on borrowed time
Your sweating palms and chilling brow
That wide-eyed panic makes you laugh
You cry and laugh

Freeze until the noise decays
A shuffle from behind a door
Your throat is tight, it makes you choke
And smoke and choke

Eyes will grow accustomed to the dark
A stifled scream that won't come out
There's nothing more to fear
From the stranger within

Don't fear the stranger within
I feel the stranger within
I see the stranger within

Don't know the stranger within
I am the stranger within
I am the stranger within
