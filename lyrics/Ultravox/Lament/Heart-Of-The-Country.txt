I was young and not deceived then
I believed in the heart of the country
How the words sound, how the truth lies
I was moved by the heart of the country

Then I saw through the charade
The facade, now I've had it all
When they ask you, "Who deprives you?"
You reply your heart of the country

I am older, I am wiser
I despise the heart of the country

Then I felt it
All the tears and the grief
I believed it all

Taking bad times by the handful
Do what you can for the heart of the country
They dish the dirt out, hard to swallow
Just to follow the heart of the country

Heed the words and learn the lines
I'll be fine when I have it all

Heart of the country
Heart of the country
Heart of the country
Heart of the country

Heart of the country
Heart of the country
Heart of the country
Heart of the country

Heart of the country
