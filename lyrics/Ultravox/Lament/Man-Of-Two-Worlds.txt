Taking shelter by the standing stones
Miles from all that moves
Breathing solitude, seeking confidence
A gift to me
Feeling spirits never far removed
Passing over me and I greet them with open arms

Hand fighting hand
As you turn to a man of two worlds
Taobh ri taobh tha sinn mar aon de dha shaobhail
Do lambh nam lambh gabhal aithne air leim a ghablh

Reading passages of ancient rhyme
Cut so deep so old
Telling tales of travellers and mystery
Hearing spirits never far removed
Call out aloud
When the time comes they'll talk to me

Hand fighting hand
As you turn to a man of two worlds
Taobh ri taobh tha sinn mar aon de dha shaobhail
Do lambh nam lambh gabhal aithne air leim a ghablh
Hand fighting hand
As you turn to a man of two worlds

Feel a presence moving into me
Painting pictures with it's words
Seeing places that I've never seen
Like a door thrown open on a life I've lived before

Taobh ri taobh tha sinn mar aon de dha shaobhail
Do lambh nam lambh gabhal aithne air leim a ghablh
Mar e shealbhaichis mi an tiodhlac seo ahonisa
S mo lambh n'ad lambh smuainich air na tireauu ceinne
S mi deaunabh gardochas da raire
