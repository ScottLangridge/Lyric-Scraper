Moments like this
I wish that you were mine
And I find that all the tears that you have cried were mine

How I long to hear you laughing now
And to feel the sun come breaking through the clouds

Chorus:

From each side of the world
We're calling
Watching the walls come falling down
And you know
Together we go on learning
Perfecting the art of common ground

I feel you within
Majestic and dignified
Dry your eyes as we go through the ritual of time

This is more than just survival now
Together we are guided through somehow

(Chorus)

How I long to hear you laughing now
And to feel the sun come breaking through the clouds

(Chorus)
