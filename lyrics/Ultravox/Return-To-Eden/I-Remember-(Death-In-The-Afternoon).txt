We turned the dial, we heard the news and laughed
We don't know why
We drank the wine and spoke of times we knew
Of days gone by

We flicked through photographs we had
Somehow they made us sad
Remembering the times we used to have
It made us cry

Oh, I remember
Death in the afternoon

A silence fell about the room with harsh
And heavy calm
The lovers and the friends all felt the same
It kept us warm

We raised our glass and drank to times we had
But'd see no more
The pictures of the past would haunt us still
And there remains

Oh, I remember
Death in the afternoon

We turned the dial, we heard the news and laughed
We don't know why
We drank the wine and spoke of times we knew
Of days gone by

We flicked through photographs we had
Somehow they made us sad
Remembering the times we used to have
It made us cry

We turned the dial, we heard the news and laughed
We don't know why
We drank the wine and spoke of times we knew
Of days gone by

We flicked through photographs we had
Somehow they made us sad
Remembering the times we used to have
It made us cry
