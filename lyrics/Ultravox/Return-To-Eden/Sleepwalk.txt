Sleepwalk. (Repeat 3 times)

Rolling and falling, I'm choking and calling,
Name after name after name.

Sleepwalk. (Repeat 3 times)

Naked and bleeding, the streetlights stray by me,
Hurting my eyes with their glare.

Sleepwalk. (Repeat 3 times)

Helplessly breaking, exchanging my faces,
Destined, we had to collide.

Sleepwalk!

Taut on the outside, I'm crumpling and crawling,
Watching the day drag away.
Spiralling deeper, I can't feel my fingers,
Rip round my throat as I dream.

Dream!

Sleepwalk. (Repeat 12 times and fade)
