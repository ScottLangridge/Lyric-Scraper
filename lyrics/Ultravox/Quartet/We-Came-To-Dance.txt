Chorus:

We came to dance.
Making moves from a passion play.
The ties that bind us just slip away.
We came to dance.
The piper calls out a different rhyme.
He cracks the whip and we step in time.

Standing as the parade goes passing by.
I hear a voice around me cry.
Like the sound of distant drums.
Rejected and alone.
A heart without a home.
And someone said...

[Chorus:]

We came to dance.

Waiting as the panic grips my hand.
Hearing prose from high command.
Like a million times before.
No dignity or grace.
It's the prize and not the race.
And someone said...

[Chorus:]

We came to dance.

We came to dance.
Making moves from a passion play.
The ties that bind us just slip away.

"Take what you can" they said.
Take it while you may.
But keep in mind the penalty fits the crime.
And it deals no softened blow.

(Chorus - Repeat 3 times and fade)
