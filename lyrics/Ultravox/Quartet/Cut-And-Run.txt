Chorus:

See the man on the phone with the gun in his hand
Sipping courage from a crystal cup
He's a man in the wrong with a gun at his head
Pressure's on him now it's time to cut and run

Time passing so slowly
Still as he sits and he watches
The sand slip through his hands
He demands something more
Something strong
Something savage and pure
One more twist of the knife
And it's time to cut and run

[Chorus:]

He smiles
As he draws on his last cigarette
And he tries
To forget all that forces every move
He commands something new
Something strong
Something spiteful and true
One more twist of the knife
And it's time to cut and run

Cries on his tape
So they might understand
Signs his farewell
With a squeeze of his hand

(Chorus x3 to fade)
