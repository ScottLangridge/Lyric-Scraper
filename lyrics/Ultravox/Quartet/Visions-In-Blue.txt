Face in the window in the night
Caught for a second by the light
Ashes of memories still aglow
(Only for you)
Portraits and pictures you once saw
Visions in blue

Read while the letters still remain
Sip from the wine of youth again
Oaths made in silence still return
(Only for you)
Cast like a shroud you're clutching on
Visions in blue

Catch aimless smiles from passersby
Listed and broken in reply
Death seems to mist the hazy view
(Only for you)
Tears coat your lifeless eyes with dew
Visions in blue, visions in blue

Ashes of memories still aglow
Portraits and pictures you once saw
Ashes of memories still aglow
Portraits and pictures you once saw
Ashes of memories still aglow
Portraits and pictures you once saw...

Face in the window in the night
Caught for a second by the light
Ashes of memories still aglow
(Only for you)
Portraits and pictures you once saw
Visions in blue
