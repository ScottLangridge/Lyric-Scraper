The flower dies the camera never lies fire baptizes
The truth is light right or wrong is never black or white
We all wear disguises

If a picture could talk we would all look away
There'd be too many voices
Rain come on and wash away this hot city skin
Pictures and memories and hope once again

So many times I see you in my mind when I'm not trying to
I see a trellis gate and I run like a child who's late
Whose friends are waiting for him
Well I never stopped to realize what was passing me by
But love has a texture
Catch a glimpse a reflection
Of what would should or could have been
Pictures and memories and hope once again

I wonder if we know the future is now
I wonder if we know the future is here
