Well it looks like it might rain but rain ain't what we need
Sunshine and a war machine I'm gettin ready for another stampede
Grease the gears with blood paint it black as night
Ride through the city like a Trojan horse
Convinced what you're doin's all right

Hold on 'till the river goes down the river goes to the sea
Hold on the rive's comin' down on me
The killin' field has come to main street
Scatter guns in the liquor store
Rifled sinkhole graves in concrete it's out of hand
At black fathom 4

Fallen leaves turn grey faces cold and worn
Memories of a better time swept away like a firestorm
Who can get it straight who can think it through
When every time the telephone rings
You think it's someone comin' after you

Your mamma's shootin' Gallery wages
Your daddy don't give a damn no more
Keep these animals breakin' cages violent times
At black fathom 4

Walk into my world where brave can get you dead
You get together and a fight breaks out
Someone didn't understand what you said
Walk into my world anger's in my soul
Quick money give me double trouble
Friends are doing hard times in the hole

Children crying sniper thunder case the alleys and the corridors
Don't look back it ain't no wonder it's open season
At black fathom 4
