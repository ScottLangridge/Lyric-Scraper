Buried deep under blood and skin
A whisper a tempest is raging from within
I hold my breath bitter proud
Afraid to scream fire in the middle of a crowd
I ponder incision envision the brain
I beckon the surgeon to a slice against the grain
Now that I've waisted you
The white room is pure the doctors are brave
If there's a cure I want to be saved
Sanctuary

Under the knife sharp and shiny key
Repair redeem resurrection
Under the knife they'll cut you out of me
Maybe love's imitation is life under the knife

I have come to determine a reasonable doubt
Where heaven and hell draw their boundary lines about
Now that I've waisted you now that I've tasted you
The white room had frost on the cold window pane
Your love had been lost my love was in vain
Sanctuary

Cynical splices stitch and install
Solder the filaments I feel nothing at all
Second wind secrets let them rise let them fall
I'll walk through your firestorm but never never crawl
The gambler lives the blood stain dries
It's time to forgive I open my eyes
Sanctuary
