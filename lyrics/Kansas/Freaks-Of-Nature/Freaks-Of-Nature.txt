Freak of nature fact or fright
Puts up with pain puts up with spite

Scarred up shoes have lost their sheen
It looks like better days they've seen

Chameleon man naive tycoon
Will eat the poor with silver spoon

He'll jest and jeer through looking glass
But nest right near the upper class

Who'll be the first one pointing at the simple man
Now I know I'm only lucky every freak of nature should know
How to run the whole freakin' show

Freak of nature'd rather be no less a man than you or me
He'd rather look the other way choose to fight another day

I take things for granted turn the tables 'round
What if I was down

To much goin' on runnin' out of time
And I don't understand it
