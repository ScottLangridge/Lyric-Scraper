I can fly I really can wave good-bye familiar land
Catch the wind make my climb breathin in born again feelin fine
I can fly above distress I can fly to heaven no less
Leave the earth forget the time light as air I don't care feelin fine
Don't say I'm crazy don't say I'm out of my head
I might be crazy but one thing's for certain one thing's for sure
I can fly above the sea I can fly hey look at me
Without a net leave it behind
Feelin good feelin free feelin so fine

My lofty purchase high above I'm losing sight of you
I'm climbing up just like a kite the calm before the storm
When all at once it dawned on me where I'm not supposed to be
Clouds are black the sky is red I'm where the angles fear to tread
I feel like I've lost my way

Down and down and down I go I've lost all sense of my direction
This flaming spitfire flight has come undone
Grounding stages of rejection I am not worthy to have even tried
Help me annihilate this foolish pride where Icarus died

I say the act of my contrition be sure to bless all before I die
Save my seat in the smoking section cut me loose and say good-bye
I wake up on the doctors table where life and death are up for grabs
I'm comin I'm comin you better shoot me
Kill the pain and count the scabs no no no get out of my black dream
Give me life give me life I'll make a vow
I'll resist temptation I promise here and now
You see it all started when I was younger they said I was good
But I thought they said great
I crown myself the king of liars I am what I have learned to hate
