Three pretenders forced their entry
There wasn't time to defend or attack
Somewhere inside I held their fury
But one by one my defenses began to crack

The first became a voice from my childhood
Without a world to call his own
Asking questions but doubting the answers
And too confused to stand up and face it alone

I can feel my body tremble
Like an animal under the gun
Can you feel your body tremble
Look in and see the eyes of Three Pretenders

The second came a shadowy hustler
Selling anything not nailed to the ground
He put a price on my resistance
And if it's high, I know he'll be marking it down

The third became a mysterious traveller
Stormy words like sea-weathered sails
His life was scarred with peaks and valleys
A haunted kingdom crumbling against the gales

I can feel my body tremble
Like a child afraid of the dark
Can you feel your body tremble
Look in and see the eyes of Three Pretenders
