Tomb 19 was sacred 1.000 years or more
The Mayan king was restless a curse upon the door
His shrouds of royal fabric his journey to be made
To offer spirits good and evil 14 beads of jade

The jade had ancient power or so beliefs allege
To anyone who plundered they would drive him to the edge

If you take the treasures of Tomb 19
Let the curse remind you
Take the treasures of Tomb 19
But never look behind you

On the walls of limestone temples
Were medallions craved in stone
Describing what was waiting in the Eerie catacombs
Though time leaves them in ruins their silhouettes pervade
To guard the kings and heroes and the 14 beads of jade

If you take the treasures of Tomb 19
Let the curse remind you
Take the treasures of Tomb 19
But never look behind you
