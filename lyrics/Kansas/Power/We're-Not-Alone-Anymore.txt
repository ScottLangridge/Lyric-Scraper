I got down on myself it looked like I was falling off the shelf
It was the wrong direction
I got way behind searching inside everybody trying to find
My own reflection

But I got something to say so get out of my way
'Cause I'm not all alone anymore
Better sound the alarm stand your ground raise your arm
'Cause you're not all alone anymore

I got out of control I figured there was a lock on rock and roll
And I lost the combination
But you better beware I'm used and abused I got nothing to lose
And I'm back from my vacation

But I got something to say so get out of my way
'Cause I'm not all alone anymore
Better sound the alarm stand your ground raise your arm
'Cause you're not all alone anymore

Stand up - We're not alone anymore
Stand up
Look up - We're not alone anymore
Look up

I got something to say so get out of my way
'Cause I'm not all alone anymore
Better sound the alarm stand your ground raise your arm
'Cause we're not all alone anymore
