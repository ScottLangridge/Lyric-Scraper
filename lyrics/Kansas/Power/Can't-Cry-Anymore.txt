1. 000 years could come and go but we would never change
It doesn't matter how we try our hearts remain the same
You see how quickly distance grows close your eyes and it appears
And we've pretended long enough no more time no more tears

I just can't cry I can't cry anymore
While you throw our lives away
I just can't cry I can't cry anymore
While you throw our lives away Throw them away

Something happened long ago and we grew apart
We turned our heads the other way and so we turned our hearts
But girl I'm not blaming you and I'm not blaming me
It's just the way the story goes we grew up but separately

I just can't cry I can't cry anymore
While you throw our lives away
I just can't cry I can't cry anymore
While you throw our lives away Throw them away
