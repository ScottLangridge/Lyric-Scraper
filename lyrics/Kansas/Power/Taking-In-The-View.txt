The world began to change the children moved and they had children
It was all arranged you couldn't live there anymore
All you had was that old place in the middle of the path of progress
So they took the space and put the ceiling on the floor
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
It was hidden so well that no one knew
Just the place for taking in the view

The view of the sea crisp and clear and never ending
There your soul ran free there you spirit soared
The view took you away to the boundaries of imagination
Back to yesterday back to once before
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
A mysterious space without a clue
Just the place for taking in the view

Long lives need no fortune
Hard lives need no fame
Young lives seek their freedom
And old lives seek the same

The world began to change and without a word of explanation
Something very strange started beckoning to you
When they came to move your things you had packed a suitcase full of memories
Nothing else to bring except a different point of view
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
A mysterious space without a clue
Just the place for taking in the view
