Silhouettes debate then they test their fate
Pride is on the line the signs are dangerous
Hands too number to feel wrapped around the wheel
Tonight they face the fact some are never coming back

Silhouettes in Disguise leather hearts lawless eyes
Dancing shadows over rock and under fire
Some will cry "table's turned."
Some will die but none will learn
Silhouettes in Disguise crash and burn.

They pick the time and place then they fall from grace
They're riding on a rail trying to chase the dragon
Engines never cool trade their sins for fuel
That's what they're running on
When they're blown to kingdom come

Silhouettes in Disguise leather hearts lawless eyes
Dancing shadows over rock and under fire
Some will cry "table's turned."
Some will die but none will learn
Silhouettes in Disguise crash and burn.

Silhouettes in danger on the wrong side of the tracks
Eye to eye. Eye to eye.
Rising up in anger. Disguising their attacks
On the edges of the world.

Silhouettes in Disguise leather hearts lawless eyes
Dancing shadows over rock and under fire
Some will cry "table's turned."
Some will die but none will learn
Silhouettes in Disguise crash and burn
