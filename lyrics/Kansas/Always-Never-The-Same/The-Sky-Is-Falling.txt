In Your Eyes

Seal no fate and hold no key
When all goes well spend some time remembering
Know by now that times have changed
But we feel each day can be deeper deeper

It might be raining now
But don't be scared you won't drown
I'll hold you in my arms when the rivers rise
Lay my heart besides your soul
Don't let the tears blur the vision in your eyes

Once my eyes get used to the dark
I look around it's almost like I'm dreaming
Shooting stars how they seem so close
I feel your body it's moving breathing
