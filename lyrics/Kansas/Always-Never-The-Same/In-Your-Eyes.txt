In Your Eyes

Seal no fate and hold no key
When all goes well spend some time remembering
Know by now that times have changed
But we feel each day can be deeper deeper

It might be raining now
But don't be scared you won't drown
I'll hold you in my arms when the rivers rise
Lay my heart besides your soul
Don't let the tears blur the vision in your eyes

Once my eyes get used to the dark
I look around it's almost like I'm dreaming
Shooting stars how they seem so close
I feel your body it's moving breathing

The Sky Is Falling

The lottery winner thinks forever
Is something she can buy
All the pictures on the wall
Are hanging high so they won't fall
Until her tear stained floor is dry

The pool shark's life is stranger than fiction
But today's his lucky day
He bets it all on a final game
But then he chokes ain't that a shame
The 8 ball had one last thing to say

Just stop the sky from falling
Falling down on me
Stray cats are creepy calling
Hound dog harmony
Just stop the sky from falling
Dodge the buck shot rain
This tree house free for all
The sky is falling
Who's got a crane

Jazz singer padlocks all his memories
Long nights have left their mark
His lava lamp condition
His black light intuition
How come tomorrow seams so dark?
