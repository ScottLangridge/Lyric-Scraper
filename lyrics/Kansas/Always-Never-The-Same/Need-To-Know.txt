Need To Know

How do I know what you say is real
How do I know if that's the way you feel
You're the only one who's seen me
In the dark hours in the kitchen chair
Are you still there do you still care
That's all I really need to know

Watching the rain come pouring down
Washing the stain off this old town
They say misery loves company
But ain't there something else we can share
Are you still there do you still care
That's all I really need to know

It scares a man
When glory days are gone
But here I stand
I know I'mn not alone
I got pictures in my mind
And the radio takes me back in time
Are you still there you're in my prayer
That's all I really need to know
