Give me your answer let me know today
I'm searching in wonder you're making me pay
I need you 'cause my life's turning grey
Oh, it's you, Oh I'm blue

You left a message to say you had fled
Couldn't believe that you wrote what I read
I couldn't count all the times I have said
Oh, it's you, Oh I'm blue

Love make my day
Show me the way

Give me your answer let me know today
I'm searching in wonder you're making me pay
I need you 'cause my life's turning grey
Oh, it's you, Oh I'm blue
