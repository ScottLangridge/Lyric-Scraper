This is my beginning
Tomorrow holds my hand
Yesterday is dead and gone
Buried in the sand
The vision stands before me
And now there's nothing else
So close your eyes and realize
The way I see myself

One man, one heart
Standing in the flame
Can you hear my voice tonight
I'm calling out - I'm calling out your name

You've broken my defenses
And opened up my soul
The love I tried to keep inside
I cannot control
So let the wind be silent
The ocean turn to sand
And let your body dream of me
And see me as I am

One man, one heart
Standing in the flame
Can you hear my voice tonight
I'm calling out your name

One man, one heart reaching for the light
If I can hold on, I'll come through the dark
