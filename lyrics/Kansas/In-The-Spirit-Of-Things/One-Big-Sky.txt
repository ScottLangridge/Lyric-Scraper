Colored banners - color kills
What color is the blood that spills
If we don't see it no one will
Under one big sky
Guns and plowshares - promise land
Ghosts of war stretch out their hand
If we don't hear them no one can
Under one big sky

Under one big sky a voice is crying to be heard
But in a world where love has died
That voice seems so absurd
We are children of the future
- maybe we're just passing through here
All depends on what you do here
Under one big sky

Quest for power; pay the cost
Liberty in tempest tossed
If we don't stop them, we'll be lost
Under one big sky

Under one big sky a voice is crying to be heard
But in a world where love has died
That voice seems so absurd
We are children of the future
- maybe we're just passing through here
All depends on what you do here
Under one big sky
