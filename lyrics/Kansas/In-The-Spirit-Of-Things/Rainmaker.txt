Have you ever seen a miracle - you couldn't doubt or imitate
What's it really worth to you to shake the holy hand of fate
Well I did what I could to make ends meet
Been a gunrunner and a medicine man
In a Kansas town I was a rainmaker - there the hand of fate got out of hand

Rainmaker Rainmaker save this one horse town
Rainmaker pray to heaven

From the Flint Hills the land was cracked and dried
Thirsty streets in misery
I took the sign down that said medicine man
Put one up that said rainmaker - that was me
So the townspeople gave me money up front
To light a fire - pray, and dance around
Tell them it'd rain so they'd all go to bed
And I'd make my break clean out of town

But I started this dance and a storm kicked up
The sky went black from coast to coast
It was too late to stop - it was to late to pray
I had summoned down the Holy Ghost
Oh the searing wind and the clouds of dust
And hell came raining down
What came out of me and the powers that be
Was the last of that one horse town
