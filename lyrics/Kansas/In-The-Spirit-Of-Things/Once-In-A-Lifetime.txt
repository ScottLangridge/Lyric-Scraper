If only it was raining out tonight
Reflections on the sidewalks would take me back in time
You told me when I left you standing there
Someday I'd be sorry
Well that day is here

I was wrong, oh so wrong
I should have known
That you were the one
Now I know a love like yours only comes along

Once in a lifetime
Once in your life you'll find
The kind of love that never ends
The kind I want back again

You were trying
I could see it in your eyes
As I held a one way fare
To some false paradise
I was dying to spread my restless wings
Now just to see your face again
I'd do anything

I was wrong, oh so wrong
A dreamer in a small town can survive
Now I know it's love like yours
That keep these dreams alive

Once in a lifetime
Once in your life you'll find
The kind of love that never ends
The kind I want back again
So let the rain fall down
Take me back oh take me back
Don't let me down
Let the rain fall down
It's such a lonely sound
Don't let me down

Once in a lifetime
Once in your life you'll find
The kind of love that never ends
The kind I want back again
