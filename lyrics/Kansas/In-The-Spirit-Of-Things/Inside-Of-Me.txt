The fire's inside me - the bridges burn
Love is the lesson but love never learns
And if it's all up to me, in a matter of time
All theses memories will return

Try to run a little faster - try to reach for the sky
Try to come a little closer; even if I lose, I gotta try

Inside of me, is a man that I knew
Who could rattle these chains - who could shake these cages
Inside of you, is a dream that I see
And the echoes of voices are calling
Inside of me - Inside of me

I've captured the nightmares that burst in your bed
I've run with the horses inside your head
But as I turned to walk away, I never heard you say
"We are hanging by a thread!"

So I skated in circles over cracks in the ice
And I stand in the shadows; now my heart must pay the price

Inside of me, is a man that I knew
Who could rattle these chains - who could shake these cages
Inside of you, is a dream that I see
And the echoes of voices are calling
Inside of me - Inside of me
