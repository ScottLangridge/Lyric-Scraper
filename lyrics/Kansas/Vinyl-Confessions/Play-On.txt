All of my life, the wheels were turning
Drawing me near, to something that's burning bright
The music begins, a song that is new
Joining as one, it leads me to you

[Chorus:]
Play on, play on, lifting our voices to reach the sky
Play on, play on, singing a song and my heart's on fire

My morning star, has always been with me
Lifting me up, when I couldn't carry on
Turning the page, to each song I write
Leading me on, on through the night

[Chorus:]

Living the song
Holding on to a dream that never dies
I open my eyes
Learning the word that never fade
Now it begins
Never to end
It's the prize I long for

Play on, play on, lifting our voices to reach the sky
Play on, play on, sound a refrain  to be heard on high
Play on, play on, singing a song and my heart's on fire
