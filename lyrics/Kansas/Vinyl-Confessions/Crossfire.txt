Underneath the sky of blue, it's a time of choosing
Everybody's holding on, to what they're losing
But it all works out okay, if you give your life away
To the one who's holding fast, it's a promise that will last

[Chorus:]
You're caught in a crossfire
Of a greater love than man has ever known
Caught in a crossfire
And you've got to choose which way you're gonna go
Caught in a crossfire
In a world of darkness turn to the light

Time's disappearing, all that you're fearing
Dreamers awaken, chances are taken away

There isn't any in-between, there's no escaping
If you step across the line, it's illuminating
And the words are clear and true
And they all were meant for you
For you harvest what you sow, so where you gonna go

[Chorus:]

There's no pretending no other ending
All is forgiven, if you are living anew

Everybody faces it, now or later
You can't get around it, 'cause it's human nature
And deep within the hardest heart
There is something there that knows
There's a hunger life can never fill
'Til you face the one who rose

[Chorus:]

Time's disappearing, all that you're fearing
Dreamers awaken, chances are taken
There's no pretending no other ending
All is forgiven, if you are living anew, living anew
