You're a rich man, but a poor man
With your pockets lined with gold
Always in the middle neither hot or cold
And you think you've found your freedom
But it always slips away
Nothing ever satisfies, you always have to pay

(Chorus)
(On the) Borderline, you're standing on the borderline
You're waiting for the place and time
And living in between
(On the) Borderline, you're standing on the borderline
It's gotta be your world or mine
So which way will you lean

So much indecision
Leaves you hanging in the air
You can't remain forever 'cause there's nothing there
With one foot in the ocean
And the other on the shore
You'll be goin' nowhere, 'til you step on through the door

(Chorus)

Now I know your wheels are spinning
But you never seem to move
I can see right through you
So what you tryin' to prove
And it's not coincidental
That you're always on the run
No more second chances now
The day is almost done

(Chorus)
