Some of you may know me and many of you won't
I am just a player in the band
Some of you will listen and some of you will hear
Some of you may laugh at me and some of you will cheer
'Cause all of us, we are an audience
Looking for evidence, to help it all make sense

[Chorus:]
Have we left the answers far behind
Are we running from the light
And our legs are growing weaker
Chasing shadows in the night

Tell me have you noticed, the tide is rolling in
The waves are crashing harder now
The shore is wearing thin
The message in the bottle, has been lost at sea
But the word live on forever, it's meant to be

[Chorus:]
(Instrumental)
[Chorus:]
