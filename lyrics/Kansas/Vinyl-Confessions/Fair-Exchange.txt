Your credit is good if you're a member
Just a token to help the people remember
All we've done for you
Nobody buys and nobody sells
And nobody speaks 'til the chairman tells you
We're gonna be your religion, throw those others away

[Chorus:]
Fair exchange for your freedom
Fair exchange for your life
Hail the new perfect order
Ending trouble and strife
No one can refuse our offer, it's a fair exchange

You're on file, our computer
Knows what's best for you
We will provide the solution, for the rest of you
Safety and peace, the terror will cease
Forget everything the fanatics tell you
Now you can worship the leader
All he wants is your soul

[Chorus:]

We're under control, never worry
Always watching you
Now you're a part of the program
We'll be using you
What do you want? We know what you need
Get out of line, we eliminate you
All for the good of the people
Better one man should die

[Chorus:]
