How many times do I have to tell you
That things just can't go on this way
We've tried so many times but things go on the same
We've spent one too many years in all this pain
And the light is shining in your eyes
And still it makes you wonder

[Chorus:]
It's time we face it (are you blind can't you see)
It's time we face it

How long will we go on playin' this fool's game
How long will a candle burn it's flame
We've tried, we've tried so man times, so many ways
When will we ever learn from our mistakes

And the point is either right or wrong
'Cause when I'm weak then I am strong
And the truth will find us all someday
And the price is more than you can pay

It's time we face it (are you blind can't you see)
It's time we face it (can't go on in misery)
It's time we face it (was it really meant to be)
It's time we face it (I don't know)
It's time we face it
