You think that something's happening
And it's bigger than your life
But it's only what you're hearing

Will you still remember
When the morning light has come
Will the songs be playing over
And over
Till you do it all over again

Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
Is it worth the time
Is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight
Then play the game tonight

And when the curtains open
To the roaring of the crowd
You will feel it all around you
Then it finally happens
And it's all come true for you
And the songs are playing over
And over
Till they do it all over again

Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
Is it worth the time
Is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in the white spotlight
Then play the game tonight
