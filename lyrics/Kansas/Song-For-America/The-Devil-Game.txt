I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall
So many men have drowned in evil
And left Lucifer standing tall
Don't take the devil's dare
Don't gamble when the game ain't fair,
Lock and bolt the doors
Can't let the devil use you anymore

You got to listen all you mugs and reivers if you do any wrong
You make it right
You can't be a make-believer
'Cause soon you're gonna pay the price
Lying, hat and pain, all parts of the devil game
Got his foot inside the door
But you can't let him use you anymore

Take, he will take, he will take, give him nothing he'll take,
He will take, he will take, he will give nothing but he'll take

Take, he will take, he will take, give him nothing he'll take,
He will take, he will take, he will give nothing but he'll take

Pray, for devils have no reason
Satan waits to curse your ways
Have you seen it in his eyes in the sunset
Have you wondered if he's laughing when he play
Has he asked if you're alone, if what he sees is all you own
Has he offered you happiness, money, or much better lays

*Satan leave me*
Leave me lonely
*Satan leave me*
Leave us alone

I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall
Take a look at what the future's holdin'
Won't be yours if you don't heed the call
Life is a game, and the stakes will remain the same
Now you've gotta choose, is the devil gonna win or lose again
