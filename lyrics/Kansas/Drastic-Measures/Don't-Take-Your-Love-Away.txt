You can take away the money
Take away the flame
Take away the things that I possess

You can take all my dreams away
The things that I need to survive
You can have it all

(Chorus)
Don't ever, don't ever take your love away
Don't ever, don't ever take your love away
Don't ever, don't ever take your love away
Don't, take your love away
Don't

The years are passing by me
Like a fast train that's here and gone
It's gone
Where they go, I just don't know

But I don't care
'Cause there's something 'round the bend
And it's waiting there for me
So don't ever take it away

'Cause nothing means a thing unless you're here
To live without your love's my only fear
I just want to let you know
I can't make it on my own

(Chorus)

Never before have I needed something so bad
I never thought I'd be willing to give up so much
The way that I feel when I look in your eyes, I want you
So don't take away what I need more than anything else

Don't take your love away
