Someone calls out my name
They ask me how I've been
So what's it like in the big time?
Will you be my friend

Have you met Mick Jagger?
Ringo, George or Paul?
Do you have my number?
Will you give me a call?

4 o'clock in the morning
I hear the telephone ring
It's the voice of a stranger saying
I like the way you sing

[Chorus:]
They all want to know
Do you make a lot of money?
They all want to know
Will you change your name?
They all want to know
What's it like to be a rock star?
Everybody wants to know if they can hang around

Everybody's my friend, hello, hello
Everybody's my friend, hello, hello

Everybody wants to have a little piece of the action
Everybody wants to get into the show
Everybody falls in love with the main attraction
Everybody wants to know if they can hang around

Everybody's my friend, hello, hello
Everybody's my friend, hello, hello

Some people say that I'm changing
They say I'm not the same
But they don't understand me
There's so much more to flame

[Chorus:]
