Columbus sailed the ocean blue
To see what he would fine
With visions of another world
They said he'd lost his mind

But when he told them of the land he'd found
A land so rich with gold
To get the treasures on the other side
They left the lad of old to

[Chorus:]
Get rich now
Get rich now
Get rich now
Get rich now

Napoleon thought that he could be
The ruler of it all
The things he wanted were so very big
But he was very small

They spread the word throughout the land
That he would soon be king
But his greed and pride got in the way
And he lost everything to

[Chorus:]

Oh the president and the generals
Are getting ready for a war
The only thing that they don't know
Is what they're fighting for

They shine their suits of armor
And they tell us to prepare
While they take wealth and freedom
And just leave us standing there

Get rich now
