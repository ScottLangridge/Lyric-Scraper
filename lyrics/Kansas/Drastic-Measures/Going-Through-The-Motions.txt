Standing in line
At the usual time
With a dollar and a dime
Are you going through the motions?

Do you wear the latest style?
Can you guarantee a smile?
Won't you stop and talk awhile?
Are you going through the motions

[Chorus:]
And is your day just a reflection of the day before?
Don't you ever stop and wonder if there's something more?
Do you really mean to tell me that you're satisfied?
Are you for real or are you going through the motions?

Heresay, there'say
Everything is fine
Are you running out of time?
Going through the motions

Some things never change
Easy chair, nine to five
Get ahead, stay alive
Are you going through the motions

[Chorus:]

Stop and take a look around you
Don't say it isn't there
People going through the motions
Everywhere

I know it isn't easy
It gets tougher every day
But we keep going through the motions
Anyway

Going through the motions
