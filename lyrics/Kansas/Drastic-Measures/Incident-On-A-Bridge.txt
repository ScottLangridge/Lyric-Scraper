It began in the underground, with visions of light and sound
The music revealing the deepest passion
Around us a river raged, still I knew that the scene was staged
Awaiting the consequence, I don't believe in accidents

[Chorus:]
It's all too real, all these things we feel
As the years go by, things intensify
And I know, for each life there is a reason
And I know, for each time there is a season
Now the bridge leads on, to a brighter dawn
It's waiting for me

We were tied by a bond of fate, in our hearts we could feel the weight
Carried along by the winds of fortune
The outcome was never known, and our purpose was never shown.
'Til everything fell in place, the words on the wall we could not erase

[Chorus:]

Each piece is arranged, the puzzle's complete
Victory's taste is so bittersweet
No regrets for the time that was lost
For it all comes out in the end
And the prize is worth all the tears that it cost
For the stairway you ascend

Drawing us near
It's where we belong

The world has a lot to give, but it's worthless if you don't live
And life only comes from the one who made it
When I look back and see the plan, when I retrace the race we ran
The course was so clear and true, each bridge that we crossed led me straight to you

[Chorus:]
