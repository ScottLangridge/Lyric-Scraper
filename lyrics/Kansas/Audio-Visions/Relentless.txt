In the time we spent together
Many words have passed between
And the feelings that we shared are all behind us now
'Cause a change has come upon me
And I'm surly not the same
There is so much more than what we feel and live every day

[Chorus:]
Relentless, unchanging
Though the world  is still before me now
I'm seeing forever
I will keep my heart and mind with you
So joyously I'm waiting for the day

In a single timeless moment
When the old was cast away
The new was born into a world of simple joy
And my life is still for living
Though it's seen through different eyes
And the knowledge of the truth's
A burden easy to bear

[Bridge:]

It's drawing so near
It's shrouded in mystery
Histories fall, the end of an age
The feeling we're waiting for, hoping for
Now, the time to come alive
The end to which we strive
Will soon arrive

Now the gift is truly given
If you only would receive
For you're standing in the crossroads
And you can't turn back
Though we can't conceive forever
And it's sometimes hard to care
Our lives do not compare to what's awaiting us there
