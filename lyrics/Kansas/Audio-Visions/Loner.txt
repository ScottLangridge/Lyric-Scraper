I remember when I saw your face I said out loud she's out of place
She's summer's child and still she feels no freedom
Your hair was long and so was mine when we were young I felt a kind of magic
Did you feel that for me

(Chorus)
I thought that you would understand you thought that I was in your hand
Now's the time when I can't stay not even you can change the way
I'm a loner

I remember when I saw your eyes I said out loud I realize
That beauty often hides a heart that's hardened
You tell me now you use them all they love it best before they fall
Collected like a flower in your garden

(Chorus)
