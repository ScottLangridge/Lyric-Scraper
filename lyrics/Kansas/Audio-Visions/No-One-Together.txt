Centuries of backward ways
Have many left behind us
Who can count the good men gone away
The fruits of all our labors
Have left us as we started
We've come too far to end it in a day

It seems that everything we do is wrong
A one-way trip to nowhere all along
Just look around and tell me what you see
Another stupid page of history

No one together
No one is touching ground
Look at each other
Chaos is all around
Same situation
Nothing is really new
No one together
No one is me and you

Lo the horn of plenty
Is bursting at the seams
The harvest of the world will be our prize
We claim to know the secrets
The answers have been found
But how can one fool make another wise

'Cause nothing's better than it used to be
To live and die is still a mystery
We take away and we give nothing back
We just consume it all and still we lack

No one together
No one is touching ground
Look at each other
Chaos is all around
Same situation
Nothing is really new
No one together
No one is me and you

Each day passes by us so quickly now
You can feel it drawing
Much closer now
The signs are in the faces
Of the people in the street
The sights are in the sounds I hear
The voices filled with pain and fear
You can feel it drawing near you
Now

The multitudes are searching
And wandering in vain
For what they seek cannot be found in men
The truth that lies before us now
Is plain for all to see
To grow without is not to grow within

For in the promise is a victory
To see the way that everything should be
To feel the joy that we were meant to know
We should have realized it so long ago

We're all together
Harmony will abound
Look at each other
All that was lost is found
New situation
If our direction's true
We're all together
Everyone is me and you
