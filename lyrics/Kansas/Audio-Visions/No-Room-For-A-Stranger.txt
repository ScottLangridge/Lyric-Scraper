Have you ever felt like jumping out of a window
On account of your pride
Have you ever felt like you were losing your marbles
Caus someone hurt you deep inside

Well I had a girl so young and so healthy
I lived for her night and day
But all of her friends said since I wasn't wealthy
There'd be no room for a stranger today

I played the game and I spent all my money
I went out and tore up this town
If I had any guts and a little more whiskey
I would burn that woman down

Have you ever felt like scum in the gutter
Well that's how I felt that day
Have you ever felt like you were loose in the rudder
There'll be no room for a stranger today
