The streets of the city are barren
All the windows and doors have been closed
As the night draws near
You can feel their fear
Their freedom is just an illusion
And they tell us that love is a lie
Can it all be true
What can one man do

[Chorus:]
See the pages as they turn
Never will the children learn
Born as a prisoner in a curtain of iron
Never will the pages turn

The City of Gold's in the distance
And they've already forgotten their dream
Visions slowly fade
In this land of shade

[Chorus:]

As the power grows, darkness spreading
Hope is still alive, though we're dreading
What the future holds, no more need to
Fear what all men face
Only good can win the race

Rumors speak of war, all the nations
Turmoil in the streets, tribulations
Now it's plain to see
All the prophecies are taking place
Only good can win the race

There are fragments of truth still remaining
And they bring them the light of the world
To this hope we cling
Till the bells will ring

See the pages as they turn
In their wisdom we will learn
Our bloody history soon will resolve
See the pages as they turn
In their wisdom we will learn
Free from the prison, a Curtain of Iron
