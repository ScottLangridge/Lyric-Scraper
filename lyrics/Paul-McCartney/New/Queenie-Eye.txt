There were rules you never told me
Never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me
Didnt help me understand

But I had to get it worked out
Had nobody who could help
So then in the end it turned out
That I had to do it
By myself...

That's the game of rags to riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Until you think you know which way to turn

Make the day all the switches, wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn

Queenie eye queenie eye whos got the ball
I havent got it, it isnt in my pocket
O-you-T spells out
Thats out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about/a pout?
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

Play the game, taking chances
Every dance is much the same
Doesnt matter which event you choose

Never blame the circumstances,
With romances seldom came, ?
Never pick a fight youre gonna lose

Queenie eye queenie eye whos got the ball
I havent got it, it isnt in my pocket
O-you-T spells out
Thats out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout

Its long way, to the finish
When youve never been before
I was nervous, but I did it
Now Im going back for more

Eyyy, yeah eyyyy yeah yeah
Eyyy, yeah eyyyy yeah yeah
Here the people shout
Eyyy, yeah eyyyy yeah yeah

Queenie eye queenie eye whos got the ball
I havent got it, it isnt in my pocket
O-you-T spells out
Thats out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in a pout
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout
