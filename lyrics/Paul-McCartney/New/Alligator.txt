I want someone to come home to
I need somewhere I can sleep
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones
And have a conversation not too deep

Everybody else is busy doing better than me
But I can see why it is
They got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains
Someone let me be

I want someone who can save me
When I come home with a zoo
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator
I can give my alligator to

Everybody seems to know what they are talkin' about
And I can see why it is
They got someone breaking them out
Someone finding the key
Someone setting them free

Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?

I want someone I can bail me
When I get up to my tricks
I need somebo used to dealing with a sinner
Whenever I get in a fix

Everybody else is busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is
They got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains
Someone letting them be

Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Could you dare to find my key?
