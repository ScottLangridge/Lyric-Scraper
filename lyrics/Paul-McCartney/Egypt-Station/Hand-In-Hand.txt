[Verse 1]
Wanna give you my heart
Wanna tell you my story
Go and take it to another level, you and me
Wanna give you my word
Let me give you my promise
I will try to make it happen
You can guarantee

[Chorus]
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand

[Verse 2]
Let me on to your light
Wanna show you my passion
We can make each other happy if we get it right

[Chorus]
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand
Taking our time [?]

[Bridge]
We can make this dream come true
Only if we wanted to
We can make this dream come true
Only word we understood
Everything in life is planned
Go and make this dream come true

[Outro]
Wanna give you my heart
Wanna tell you my story
Go and take it to another level, you and me
Hand in hand
Walking through life and making our plans
Hand in hand
Hand in hand
