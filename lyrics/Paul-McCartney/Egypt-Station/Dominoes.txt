[Intro]
In time we'll know
It's all a show
It's been a blast
As time goes by we'll laugh and cry
It's in the past

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin
Living in the world we live

[Verse 1]
From day to day
We fight and play
The more we need
We'll soon forget
We ever met and disagreed

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin
Living in the world we live
This is it, here and now
We can find our way
Somehow

[Chorus]
And like the dominoes who are falling into place
Ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling constantly
Imploring us to come out and play

[Verse 2]
And soon we'll see
That you and me
We're really friends
We broke the code
And walk the road that never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin
Living in the world we live
This is it, here and now
We can find our way
Somehow

[Chorus]
And like the dominoes who are falling into place
Ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling constantly
Imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey

[Verse 3]
We'll take our time
And try to learn
To sing and dance
We'll hedge our bets
With no regrets
And take a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
We can start to begin
Living in the world we live
This is it, here and now
We can find our way
Somehow

[Chorus]
And like the dominoes who are falling into place
Ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling constantly
Imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey

[Outro]
In time we'll know
It's all a show
It's been a blast
