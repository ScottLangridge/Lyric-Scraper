[Intro]
Peace

[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen
Standing before you with something important to say
[?] your attention but
I'm not gonna let anything get my way
The message is subtle, it's straight from my heart
And I know that you've heard it before
But what does it matter, we're in it together
And I'm not quitting while people [?] for more

[Chorus]
People want peace
People want peace
A simple relief from this [?]
People want peace
People want peace

[Verse 2]
Nothing in life is as sad as the lonely, so
Searching for peers
Wanting to find [?]
We catch, we release
A-brothers and sisters, I beg you to listen
I know that it isn't too late
For we as the people, the voices of freedom
[?], no more wait

[Chorus]
People want peace
People want peace
A simple relief from this [?]
People want peace
A-people want peace

[Outro]
People want peace
People want peace
Yes, we want peace!
People want peace
People want peace
