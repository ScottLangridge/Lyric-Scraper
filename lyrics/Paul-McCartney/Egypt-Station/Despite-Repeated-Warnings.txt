Part I
[Chorus 1]
Despite repeated warnings
Our danger's up ahead
The captain won't be listening
To what's been said

[Verse 1]
It feels that there's a good chance
That we have been misled
And so the captain's planning
To steam ahead

[Verse 2]
What can we do, what can we do
What can we do to stop
This foolish plan going through
What can we do, what can we do
This band is 'bout to lose his ship and his crew

[Chorus 2]
Despite repeated warnings
From those who are to know
Well, he's got his own agenda
And so he'll go

[Bridge]
Those who shout the loudest
Will not always be the smartest
But they have their proudest moments
Right before they fall
Red sky in morning
Doesn't ever seem to faze him
But a sailor's warning signal
Should concern us all

Part II
[Chorus]
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it, we can save the day

[Verse 3]
[?]
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet (The best crew!)
We'll never want him to go
He had a premonition
He said that something's wrong
And by his own admission
He knew it all along
The captain's crazy but he doesn't let them know it
He'll take us with him if we don't do something soon to stop him

[Chorus]
How can we stop him?
Grab the keys and lock him up
If we can do it, we can save the day

[Bridge 3]
No brakes, the engineer cries
[?] the temperatures rise
[?] going up [?]
[?] down below
Down below

[Interlude 1]
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes we can do it

[Interlude 2]
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
[?] life would work out the way he planned
[?]
[?]
And that's the way he learned
How he got to do it

[Intelude 3]
Yes we can do
Yeah, we can do it
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it

[Chorus 3]
Despite repeated warnings
Our danger's up ahead
While the captain wasn't listening
To what was said

[Outro]
