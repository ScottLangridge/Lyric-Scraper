[Chorus]
You used to be my confidante
[?]
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end
I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought

[Verse 1]
In your reflected glory eye
Could dream of shining [?]
Wish I could turn to bits of string
And play like kittens in my hand

[Verse 2]
[?] every word
With butterflies [?] on thee boots
And stomp around the forests
Chanting long lost anthems
Long lost anthems

[Chorus]
You used to be my confidante
[?]
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end
I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought
You stood beside me as I fought

[Outro]
You used to be my confidante
