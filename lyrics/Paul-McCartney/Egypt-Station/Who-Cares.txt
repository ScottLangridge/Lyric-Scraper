[Intro]
A-one, a-two

[Verse 1]
Did you ever get hurt by the words people say
And the things that they do when they're picking on you?
Did you ever get sad by the end of the day
When they're making you feel like [?]

[Chorus]
It's been left in the rain
Who cares what the idiots say
Who cares what the idiots do
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do

[Bridge]
'Cause you're worth much more
A fact you can't be sure
No need to hide
The love you've got inside

[Verse 2]
Did you ever get lost in the heart of a crowd
Have the people around, people are pushing you down
Is it driving you mad and you're screaming out loud
[?] to recognize you
 
[Chorus]
You're a ghost in the dark
Who cares what the idiots say
Who cares what the idiots do
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?

[Chorus]
Who cares what the idiots say
Who cares what the idiots do
Who cares about the pain in your heart?
Who cares about you?
I do

[Outro]
You've been left in the rain
