[Verse 1]
I got crows out my window, dogs at my door
I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doin' wrong? I don't know
My brother told me, "Life's not a pain"
That was right when it started to rain
Where am I going wrong? I don't know

[Chorus]
But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
You'll find, love of mine
You will feel no pain

[Verse 2]
Well, I see trouble at every turn
I've got so many lessons to learn
What am I doin' wrong? I don't know
Now what's the matter with me?
Am I right? Am I wrong?
Now I started to see
I must try to be strong
I try to love you best as I can
But you know that I won't be your man
Where am I going wrong? I don't know

[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah
Oh, woah, woah, woah, mhmm

[Chorus]
But it's alright, sleep tight
I will take the strain
You'll find, little love of mine
You will feel no pain

[Outro]
I got crows at my window and dogs at my door
But I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doin' wrong? I don't know
Now what's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know
