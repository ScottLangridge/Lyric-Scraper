I sat round all day
I used to get stoned
I liked to get wasted
But these days I dont
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

L walked around angry
I used to feel bad
But nowadays my days
Dont have to be sad
cos I'm happy, with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

Like, hear the high clear robin sing
Walk a bluebell carpet
Watch the children playing games
Catch a moon and drop it
Hear the gentle mantle roll
On a frosty morning
See the mighty ocean break
Like a sailor's warning

L used to drink so much
Forget to come home
I lied to my doctor
But these days I don't
cos I'm happy, with you
I got lots of good things to do

Throw a pocketful of coins in the Trevi tountain
See an ice cold running stream
Rushing down the mountain
Hear a new born baby lamb
Calling for its mother
Loving one another

I sat round all day
I liked to get stoned
I used to get wasted
But these days I dont
'cos I'm happy, with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

Happy with you
I'm happy with you
Happy with you
