[Verse 1]
Back in Brazil
There lives a girl
Dreams of the future
And a far, far better world

[Verse 2]
Back in Brazil
She meets a man
He's tall and handsome
And he fits her with a plan

[Verse 3]
Bright lights ahead
Music and fun
Nights out for dancing
And the days for the sun
All kinds of weather, did surely come and go
But they're together
And together they will steal the show

[Bridge]
[?]

[Verse 4]
Back in Brazil
She met a date
He has to cancel
'Cause it got him working late
 

[Verse 5]
Back in Brazil
She feels afraid
Hope starts to crumble
And her dream begins to fade

[Verse 6]
Her lights are out
She's gone to bed
Light's out for sleeping
[?] can get ahead
Even the weather
Has started changing too
They'll be together
And together they will make it through

[Outro]
[?]
[?] as the clouds go by
Making riches of the seamless sky
The kids are happy and they don't ask why
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa you and I
