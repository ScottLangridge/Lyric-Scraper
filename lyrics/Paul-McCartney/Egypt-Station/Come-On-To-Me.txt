[Verse 1]
I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation
I swear I gotta look before you turn away
Now I don't see the point resisting your temptation

[Chorus]
Did you come on to me, will I come home to you?
If you come on to me, will I come home to you?

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

[Verse 2]
I don't think I can wait like I'm supposed to do
How soon can we arrange a formal introduction?
We need to find a place where we can be alone
To spend some special time without an interruption

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, will I come home to you?
If you come on to me, will I come home to you?

[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do, yeah
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do-do, do

[Verse 3]
Before you grab your coat, I'll try to be discrete
You know we can't be seen exchanging information

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I saw you flash a smile, that seemed to me to say
You wanted so much more than casual conversation

[Chorus]
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
If you come on to me, will I come home to you?
If you come on to me, will I come home to you?
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you

[Bridge]
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will now, uh-huh

[Chorus]
If you, if come on to me (yeah), then I'll come home to you
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you come on to me, then I'll come home to you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll come home to you
