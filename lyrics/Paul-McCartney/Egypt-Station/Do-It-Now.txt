[Verse 1]
Got the time, the inclination
I have answered your invitation
I'll be leaving in the morning
Watch me go

[Verse 2]
I don't know where the wind is blowing
Got directions to where I'm going
Nothing's happened
That's the only thing I know

[Chorus]
Do it now, do it now
While the vision is clear
Do it now
While the feeling is here
If you leave it too late
It could all disappear
Do it now
While your vision is clear

[Bridge]
Do-do
Do-do-do

[Verse 3]
I don't regret the steps I'm taking
The decision that I'm making
Is the right one
Or I'm never gonna know

[Verse 4]
Got the time, the inclination
I have answered your invitation
I'll be leaving in the morning
Watch me go

[Chorus]
So do it now, do it now
While your vision is clear
Do it now
While the feeling is here
If you leave it too late
It could all disappear
So do it now
While your vision is clear

[Outro]
Do-do
Do-do-do
