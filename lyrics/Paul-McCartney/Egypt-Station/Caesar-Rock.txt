[Intro]
The Ceasar rock
The Ceasar rock
The Ceasar rock

[Verse 1]
If I could find the words
To talk about my woman
Well I would surely shout them out
But every time I feel my inspiration coming
It's all to much, it won't come out

[Verse 2]
'Cause you pick me up, 'cause you take me down
'Cause you [?] sideways
You rip me every way I turn
If I was back to school
She gotta be my favourite teacher
There's such a lot for me to learn

[Chorus]
Ceasar rock, Ceasar rock
Ceasar rock, Ceasar rock

[Verse 2]
[?]
Exactly what is needed
When I've been [?] 'round and 'round
And if she wants me then I'll know that I succeded
I'll be heading back in town

[Chorus]
Ceasar rock, Ceasar rock
Ceasar rock, Ceasar rock

[Bridge]
Ceasar rock, Ceasar rock
Ceasar rock, Ceasar rock

[Outro]
She's a, she's a, she's a
