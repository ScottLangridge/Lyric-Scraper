There's a man,
Who plays the game of life so well,
Oo, there's such a man,
His thoughts you can never tell.
Oo, and it's just the way he thought it would be,
'Cause the day has come for him to be free,
Then he laughs, he kicks, then rolls up his sleeves,
I'm alive and I'm here forever,
This is the man.

And it's just the way he thought it would be,
'Cause the day has come for him to be free,
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves,
I'm alive and I'm here forever,
This is the man.

There's a man,
Ev'rybody thought they knew,
Oo, there's such a man,
He's not like me and you.
Oo, and it's just the way she thought it would be,
And he says, "something has happened to me."
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves,
I'm alive and I'm here forever,
This is the man.

And it's just the way he thought it would be,
'Cause the day has come for him to be free,

Did you know,
This man can do anything?
Oo, there's such a man,
I wish that we could bring.
Oo, and it's just the way he thought it would be,
'Cause the day has come for him to be free,
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves,
I'm alive and I'm here forever,
This is the man.

And it's just the way he thought it would be,
'Cause the day has come for him to be free,
And he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves,
I'm alive, hoo! And I'm here forever,
This is the man.

This is the man, oh yeah, oh yeah,
This is the man,
This is the man, this is the man, this is the man.

This is the man.
