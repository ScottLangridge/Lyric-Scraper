There is a pain, inside my heart,
You mean so much to me,
Girl, I love you,
Girl, I love you so bad.

And if you leave, my pain will go,
But that's no good to me.
Girl, I love you,
Yes, I love you so bad.

Well, it feels so good,
Sometimes it feels so bad,
This is worse than anything I've ever had.

There was a pain, but now you're here,
And I don't fear a thing.
Girl, I love you,
Yes, I love you so bad.
And she said:
" boy, I love you,
Boy, I love you so bad."

(I love) girl, I love you,
(I love) girl, I love you so bad. (I love, I love)

Well, it feels so good,
Sometimes it feels so bad,
Mm, this is worse than anything I've ever had.

There was a pain, but now you're near,
And I don't fear a thing. (I love)
Girl, I love you, (I love)
Girl, I love you so bad. (I love, I love)
And she said: (I love)
"boy, I love you, (I love)
Boy, I love you so bad."

Bad, bad, ooh-yeah.

(I love) girl, I love you,
(I love) girl, I love you.

Mm-mm-mm.
