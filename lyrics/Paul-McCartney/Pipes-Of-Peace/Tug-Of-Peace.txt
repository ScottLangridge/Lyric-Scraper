(It's a tug of war)
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace.
(It's a tug of war)
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace.
What with one thing and another it's a tug of war.
(No, no, no, no)

It's a tug of war, wo, wo.
No, no, your troubles cease
You learn to play the pipes of peace.
(It's a tug of war, wo, wo)
Learn to play the pipes of peace.

Pushing, pushing,
Pulling, pulling,
Pushing, pulling.

Whoa!


(Hey! New ending!)
