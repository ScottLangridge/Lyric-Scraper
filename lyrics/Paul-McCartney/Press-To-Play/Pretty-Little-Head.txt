Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen,
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
Hillmen come down from the lava,
Forging across the mighty river flow, oh-oh.
Always forever,
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head.

Hillmen bring garments, spices,
Carrying trinkets, silk and precious stones, oh-oh.
Exotic legends,
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head.

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh.
Hillmen are sworn to allegiance,
Living a life of silent dignity, oh-oh.
For your protection,
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head.
