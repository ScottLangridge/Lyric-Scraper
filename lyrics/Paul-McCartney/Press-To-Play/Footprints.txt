It's beautiful outside,
An old hand gathers wood,
Can he see me sitting here?
His mind is somewhere else.

His friends have flown away,
He's left out in the cold.
He won't sit by my fire,
He says he likes it in the snow.
Where footprints never go,
He likes it in the snow.

It's getting dark outside,
The old man's going home.
Has he someone waiting there?
Is he living on his own?
Where footprints never go,
He likes it in the snow.

In white blanket,
Hiding the traces of tears she didn't see.
Oh, white blanket,
Covers the memory of all that used to be,
All that used to be.
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way,
He can't help feeling that she might come back some day.

It's beautiful outside,
A magpie looks for food.
The old hand throws a crumb,
Do you think he's found a friend?
Where footprints never go,
He likes it in the snow.

Oh, white blanket,
Hiding the traces of paths he didn't take.
Oh, oh, white blanket,
Covers the memory of moves he didn't make.

Go now,

Oh, white blanket,
Hiding the traces of tears she didn't see.
Snow white blanket,
Simply covers the memory of all that used to be.
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way,
He can't help feeling that she might come back some day.
