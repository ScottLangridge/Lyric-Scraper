Can I get you to give me a minute of your time?
Can I get you to slip me the answer?
Can I get you to slow me a little of your mime?
You were always a very good dancer
Id be happy to show you a bit of what I found
Id be happy to share in it's beauty
Id be happy to lay low inevitably bound
I would only be doing my duty.

I wait, I wait, I can wait, I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait back in the car
Ill be waiting for you
Stranglehold, you know youve got on me
I don't want to go without you.
Stranglehold, youve got me where you want me
But I want to know more about you I want to know more
About you.

Are you willing to wager a little of your life?
Are you willing to take such a gamble?
Are you ready to walk on the edge of the knife?
Then I think we can skip the preamble.

I wait, I wait, I can wait. I can't wait back in the bar,
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait back in the car
Ill be waiting for you. I'll be waiting...

Stranglehold, you know, youve got on me
I don't want to go without you
Stranglehold, youve got me where you want me
And I want to know more about you I want to know more
About you.

I can wait, I can wait back in the bar I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car I'll be waiting for you.
