Ears twitch,
Like a dog,
Breaking eggs in a dish.
Do not mock me when I say
This is not a lie.

No, it isn't,
Oh, oh, oh,
Mm-mm-mm.

It's funny thing,
Half serious,
With our hands on our ears.
Living dreams with mouths ajar,
Wide awake we go to sleep.

However absurd,
However absurd it may seem.
However absurd,
However absurd it may seem.

Something special between us,
When we made love the game was over.
I couldn't say the words,
Words wouldn't get my feelings through,
And so I keep talking to you.

However absurd,
However absurd it may seem.
However absurd,
However absurd it may seem.

Custom made,
Dinosaurs,
Too late now for a change.
Ev'rything is under the sun
But nothing is for keeps.

However absurd,
However absurd it may seem.
However absurd,
However absurd that may seem...
