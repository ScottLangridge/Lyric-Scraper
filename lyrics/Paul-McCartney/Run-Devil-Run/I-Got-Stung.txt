Holy smokes land sakes alive I never thought this would happen to me
Ah-ha, yeah, ah-ha yeah
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
What a feelin came over me
Well it started in my eyes, crept up to my head
Flew into my arms, til I was stung dead
Im done, ah-ha, I got stung

Hum ah-ha, yeah ah-ha, yeah
She had all that I wanted and more
Ive never seen honey bees before
Well she started through my ears, buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over but I feel no pain
Im done, ah-ha, I got stung

Well don't think Im complainin
Because Im might pleased that we met
Cause you gimme just one little peck on the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat

If I live to a hundred and two
I wont let nobody sting me but you
Ill be buzzin round your hive
Evry day at five and Im never gonna leave once I arrive
Im done, ah-ha, I got stung
I got stung yeah, I got stung yeah

Well don't think Im complainin
