At last I've awakened to see what you've done
So what can I can do but pack up and run
I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

You say that you love me, I'm yours to command
But you can loving, my heart couldn't stand
You used me for a tool, go get yourself another fool

And now, now that we're through
You say, you meant to be true
Oh, but deep in your heart you know
Our love could never grow

I try to believe you that we never...
But you can loving us broke my poor heart
Now I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

And now, now that we're through
You say, you meant to be true
Oh, but deep in your heart you know
Our love could never grow

Well I try to believe you that we never...
Your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
But I know your rules go get yourself another fool

Yeah you'd better get yourself, get yourself
You'd better get yourself another fool
Go ahead and get yourself
Get yourself, get yourself another fool
Uuh
