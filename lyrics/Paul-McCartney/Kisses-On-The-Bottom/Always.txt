Everything went wrong and the whole day long
I'd feel so blue.
For the longest while I'd forget to smile
Then I met you.
Now that my blue days have passed, 
Now that I've found you at last, 

Chorus:
I'll be loving you always, 
With a love as true always.
When the things you plan need a helping hand, 
I will understand always, always.
Days may not be fair always.
That's when I'll be there, always, 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year but always.
Days may not be fair always.
That's when I'll be there, always, 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year but always
