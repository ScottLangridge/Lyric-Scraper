You can dress me up as a robber,
But I won't be in disguise.
Only love is a robber
And he lives within your eyes.
Oo-oo-oo oo-ee-oo.

You can dress me up as a sailor,
But I'll never run to sea,
As long as your love is available to me
What do I do with a sea of blue?
Oo-ee-oo.

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

Dressing me up,
It doesn't make a diff'rence what you want to do.
Which ever way you look at it,
I'm still in love with you.
If we go on forever, I may never make a change.

Dressing me up, (dressing me up)
And if I don't convince you, you needn't look too far
To see that I'm not lying
But I love you the way you are.
What's the point of changing when I'm happy as I am?

You can dress me up as a soldier,
But I wouldn't know what for,
I was the one that told you he loved you,
Don't wanna go to another war.
No, no, no.

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.
