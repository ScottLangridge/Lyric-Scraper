The pound is sinking,
The peso's failing,
The lira's reeling,
And feeling quite appalling.

The mark is holding,
The franc is fading,
The drachma's very weak
But ev'ryone's still trading.

The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors.

Well I fear, my dear, that it's eminently clear,
That you can't see the trees for the forest.
Your father was an extraordinary man,
But you don't seem to have inherited
Many of his mannerisms.

Oh, any of his mannerisms.

The dollar's moving,
The rouble's rising.
The yen is keeping up
Which hardly seems surprising.

The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors.

Hear me, my lover, (hear me, my lover)
I can't be held responsible now, (oh no, it wasn't me)
For something that didn't happen (i didn't do it and you knew it)
I knew you for a minute,
Oh, it didn't happen, only for a minute,
Your heart just wasn't in it any more, mm-mm-mm.

The pound is sinking,
The peso's failing,
The lira's reeling,
And feeling quite appalling.

Uh, uh, uh.
