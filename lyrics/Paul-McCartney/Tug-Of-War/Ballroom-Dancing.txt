Well, I used to smile when I was a pup,
Sailing down the nile in china cup,
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out my back pocket.

That's it, kids!

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight,
We used to fight like cats and dogs
Till me made it up in the ballroom.

Ballroom dancing, made a man of me,
One, two, three, four,
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on tv
I got what I got from ballroom dancing.

Here we go!

Well, I used to fly when I was a kid,
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit,
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of davy crockett.

Wave the sword!

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight,
We used to fight like cats and dogs
Till me made it up in the ballroom.

Ballroom dancing, made a man of me,
One, two, three, four,
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on tv
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing.
Big B. D.

Well, the kids have flown to a better life
And the boy's a man and the girl's a wife
And the summertime never seems to last
When you're riding on a rocket.

But, but it wasn't always such a pretty sight,
Mm, we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till me made it up in the ballroom.

Ballroom dancing, made a man of me,
One and a-two and a-three and a-four,
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on tv
I got what I got from ballroom dancing.
Big B. D.

Oh!
