You've gotta get it, mm-mm,
You've gotta get it,
Don't forget it doesn't come around again.
You've gotta get it, mm-mm,
You've gotta get it and you've gotta get it good.

Once I had a little Spanish guitar,
The neighbours told me I could go pretty far.
Well, I came and I went
And my guitar got bent.

But I discovered that the people who love
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all,
And that's that,
Unless the world is flat.

I wanna get it, mm-mm,
I wanna get it just in case it doesn't come around again.
I wanna get it, mm-mm,
I wanna get it and I wanna get it good

Doo doo, doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
Doo doo, doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,

Pardon me if I've been misunderstood,
I wanna get it while the going is good.
The telephone rang
About a song I sang.

The life of cadillac and ultra for sure,
Is automatic for the lady demure,
She came and she went
Without a single dent.

You've gotta get it, mm-mm,
You've gotta get it,
Don't forget it doesn't come around again.
You've gotta get it, mm-mm,
You've gotta get it and you've gotta get it good.

Doo doo, doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, I had you!
Doo doo, doo doo, go cat!
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,

Come on, let's get it, mm-mm,
You've gotta get it, don't forget it doesn't come around again.
You've gotta get it, mm-mm.
You've gotta get it and you've got to get it good

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

Ah, ha! Ha! Ha...
