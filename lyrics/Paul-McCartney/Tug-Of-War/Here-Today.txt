And if I say I really knew you well,
What would your answer be?
If you were here today.
Uh, uh, uh, here today.

Well, knowing you,
You'd probably laugh and say
That we were worlds apart.
If you were here today.
Uh, uh, uh, here today.

But as for me,
I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more.
Uh, uh, uh,
I love you, uh.

What about the time we met? (what about the time?)
Well, I suppose that you could say
That we were playing hard to get.
Didn't understand a thing,
But we could always sing.

What about the night we cried? (what about the night)
Because there wasn't any reason
Left to keep it all inside.
Never understood a word,
But you were always there with a smile.

And if I say I really loved you
And was glad you came along.
Then you were here today,
Uh, uh, uh, for you were in my song.

Uh, uh, uh, here today.
