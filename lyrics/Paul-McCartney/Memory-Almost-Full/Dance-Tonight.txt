Everybody's gonna dance tonight
Everybody's gonna feel alright
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight

Everybody's gonna dance around
Everybody's gonna hit the ground
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight

[Chorus:]
Well you can come on to my place if you want to
You can do anything you want to do

Everybody's gonna dance tonight
Everybody's gonna feel alright
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight

(Whistling)

Well you can come on to my place if you want to
You can do anything you want to do

Everybody's gonna stamp their feet
Everybody's gonna feel the beat
Everybody's wanna dance around tonight

[Bridge:]

Everybody's gonna dance tonight
Everybody's gonna feel alright
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight

Everybody's gonna jump and shout
Everybody's gonna sing it out
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight

Well you can come on to my place if you want to
You can do anything you want to do

Everybody's gonna dance tonight
Everybody's gonna feel alright
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight
Everybody's gonna dance around tonight
Everybody's gonna feel alright tonight
