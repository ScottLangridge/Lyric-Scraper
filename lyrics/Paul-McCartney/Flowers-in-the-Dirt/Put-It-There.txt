Give Me Your Hand I'd Like To Shake It
I Want To Show You I'm Your Friend.
You'll Understand If I Can Make It Clear
Its All That Matters In The End.
Put It There If It Weighs A Ton,
That's What The Father Said To His Younger Son.
I Don't Care If It Weighs A Ton,
As Long As You And I Are Here, Put It There.
Long As You And I Are Here, Put It There.

If There's A Fight I'd Like To Fix It,
I Hate To See Things Go So Wrong.
The Darkest Night And All It's Mixed Emotions,
Is Getting Lighter Sing A Song.

Put It There...
