Oh yeah...
Candles burnin' low,
Lot's of mistle toe.
Lot'sof snow and ice,
Eveywhere we go.
Choirs singin' carols,
Right outside my door.

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Chrstmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah,
Hy hy yeah eah eah

And ya know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more)
Whoah!
That's what Chrstmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah ha ha!
I feel like runnin' wild
As eaches and a little child
Greet you neath the mistle toe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill a sheet with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to seep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
Whoah!
That's what Chrismas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh baby baby!

Yeah!
Candles burnin' low
Lots and lots of snow
Alright!
Christmas bells are ringin'
Christmas choirs singin'
Whoo!
Christmas mistletoe...
