Lonely, my life used to be lonely
Lonely like the lonely single number one
Lonely like a lonely sun
Without a single iota to shine upon

Crying, deep inside I was crying
Like the muddy Mississippi, my tears flowed
Carrying with it my lonely soul
Leaving no clue of who,
Where or what I would become

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light shine in my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and
You in my, my, my li-li-life
I'm dancing to the rhythms of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your love

Money, oh how did I have money
Enough to last me from start til the end of time
With some more to leave behind
And yet I was a cent-less pauper in distress
I can, feel the very presence of your love here
Though I've never seen the pleasure of your smile
No, I've never touched your hand
And yet youve given me eternal happiness

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light shine in my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and
You in my, my, my li-li-life
I'm dancing to the rhythms of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet love

I'm dancing to the rhythms of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever grateful for your sweet, sweet, love

I'm dancing to the rhythms of your love
Forever grateful for your love

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do with my broken life
Oh, was I lifted when I let Gods light shine in my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you
In my, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rhythms of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Giving all praises for your sweet, sweet love

I'm dancing to the rhythms of your love
Forever grateful for your love
