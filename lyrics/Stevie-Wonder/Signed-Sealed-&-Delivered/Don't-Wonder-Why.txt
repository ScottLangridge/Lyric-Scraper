[Verse:]
You never see, the little sparkle, in my eye
I wonder why
Sometimes I wish, you stop and hold me, but you pass right by
I wonder why
I tried, everything I could, I even change my walk, the way that I stood
But you, pass by me, and pretend that you don't, even see me
But I want you to know (Uuuummmm)
If one day you decide to smile, and say hello and I say goodbye (Uuuummmm)
Don't wonder why my baby (no) Don't wonder why my baby
[Verse 2:]
When I think of how you hurt me, it brings the tears, to my eyes
I just can't seem to make you happy, no matter how hard I try
I wonder why
Seems like, no matter what I do, it's never good, enough for you
My pain, it shows loud, but it still can't let go now, but I want you to know,
Now
Nights grow old and winds blow cold, so old if my loves grows cold
And I, don't wonder why my baby (woooo)baby don't wonder why
Oh yeah!
(Instrumental)
(Yeaaahhh) Seems like, no matter what I do, i'am never, never, never, never,
Never good enough for you
My pain it shows loud, oh you know I still just no matter I just can't let go
Now, but I want you to know!!!
Love me bab
Nights grow old and winds blow cold, and so old, if my love grows cold
And I've, don't wonder why bab
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why my baby
Baby don't wonder why, don't wonder why my baby
Don't wonder why, my baby
No, no, no, no don't wonder why my baby (Ooohhh)
Don't wonder why my baby
Can you hear me, can you hear me
