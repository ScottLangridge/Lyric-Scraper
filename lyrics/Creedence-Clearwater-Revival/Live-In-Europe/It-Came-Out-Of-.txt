It came out of the sky

Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little South of Moline.
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't b'lieve what he seen.
Laid on the ground and shook fearin' for his life.
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' it came out of the sky.

Well, a crowd gathered  round and a scientish said it was marsh gas.
Spiro came and made a speed about raising the Mars tax.
The Vatican said, woe, the Lord has come, Hollywood rushed out an epic film
And Ronnie the Popular said it was a communist plot.

Oh, the newspapers came and made Jody a national hero.
Walter and Eric said they'd put him on a network tv show.
The White House said, put the thing in the Blue Room, the Vatican said,
No, it belongs to Rome
And Jody said, it's mine and you can have it for seventeen million.

Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little South of Moline.
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't b lieve what he seen.
Laid on the ground a shakin', fearin' for his life.
Oh, then he ran all the way to town screamin' it came out of the sky.
