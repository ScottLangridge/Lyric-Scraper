Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin my fame and fortune
Lookin for a pot of gold
Thing got bad things got worse
I guess you will know the tune
Oh! Lord Stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound
Ill be walkin out if I go
I was just passin through
Must be seven seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends
Oh! Lord Im stuck in Lodi again

The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh! Lord, Stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For evry song Ive sung
And evry time I had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know, Id catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh! Lord, Im stuck in a Lodi again
Oh! Lord, Im stuck in a Lodi again
