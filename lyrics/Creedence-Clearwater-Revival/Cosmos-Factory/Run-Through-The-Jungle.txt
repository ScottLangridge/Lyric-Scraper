Whoa, thought it was a nightmare, low, it's all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow, the devil's on the loose
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle, don't look back to see

Thought I heard a rumblin', callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded, Satan cries, "Take aim"
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle, don't look back to see

Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom, fill the land with smoke"
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle, don't look back to see
