You never asked me what I wanted. You only asked me why.
I never thought that so much trouble was restin on my reply,
I could say it was the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one whod come.
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity,
When you know it's the way that you walk.

Why do you have to say that there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man?

Babys gotta have the things she wants.
You know she's gotta have the things she loves.
Shes got a ten-inch bamboo cigarette holder
And her black patent leather gloves.
And I'm doing everything just tryin to please her,
Even crawling around on all fours.
Oh, I thought by now that it was gonna be easy,
But she still seems to want for more.

[Chorus:]

I hear they're givin you a bad reputation
Just because youve never been denied.
You try to say youve done it all before.
Baby, you know that you just get tired.
Yet everybody loves you so much, girl.
I just don't know how you stand the strain.
Oh, I, I'm the one whos here tonight,
And I don't wanna do it all in vain.

[Chorus:]
