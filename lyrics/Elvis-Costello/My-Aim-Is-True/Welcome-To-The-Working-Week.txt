Now that your pictures in the paper being rhythmically admired
And you can have anyone that you have ever desired,
All you gotta tell me now is why, why, why, why.

Welcome to the workin week.
Oh I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you.
Welcome to the workin week.
You gotta do it till you're through it so you better get to it.

All of your family had to kill to survive,
And they're still waitin for their big day to arrive.
But if they knew how I felt theyd bury me alive.

Welcome to the workin week.
Oh I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you.
Welcome to the workin week.
You gotta do it till you're through it so you better get to it.

I hear you sayin, hey, the citys alright,
When you only read about it in books.
Spend all your money gettin so convinced
That you never even bother to look.
Sometimes I wonder if were livin in the same land,
Why dyou wanna be my friend when I feel like a juggler
Running out of hands?

Welcome to the workin week, oh, welcome to the working week.
