Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well I used to know a girl and I would have
Sworn that her name was veronica
Well she used to have a carefree mind of her
Own and a delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure if her name is veronica

Chorus:

Do you suppose, that waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica

Did the days drag by? Did the favours wane?
Did he roam down the town all the time?
Will you wake from your dream, with a wolf at
The door, reaching out for veronica
Well it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of veronica

On the empress of india
And as she closed her eyes upon the world and
Picked upon the bones of last weeks news
She spoke his name outloud again

Chorus

Veronica sits in her favourite chair and she sits
Very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get
Right and if they don't then nobody else will
But she used to have a carefree mind of her
Own, with devilish look in her eye
Saying you can call me anything you like, but
My name is veronica

Chorus
