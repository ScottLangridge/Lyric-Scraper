Bentley said to Craig "Let him have it Chris"
They still don't know today just what he meant
By this
Craig fired the pistol, but was too young to swing
So the police took Bentley and the very next thing
Let him dangle
Let him dangle
Bentley had surrendered, he was under arrest,
When he gave Chris Craig that fatal request
Craig shot Sidney Miles, he took Bentley's word
The prosecution claimed as they charged them
With murder
Let him dangle
Let him dangle

They say Derek Bentley was easily led
Well what's that to the woman that Sidney
Miles wed
Though guilty was the verdict, and Craig had
Shot him dead
The gallows were for Bentley and still she
Never said
Let him dangle
Let him dangle

Well it's hard to imagine it's the times that
Have changed
When there's a murder in the kitchen that is
Brutal and strange
If killing anybody is a terrible crime
Why does this bloodthirsty chorus come round
From time to time
Let him dangle

Not many people thought that Bentley would
Hang
But the word never came, the phone never rang
Outside Wandsworth Prison there was horror
And hate
As the hangman shook Bentley's hand to
Calculate his weight
Let him dangle

From a welfare state to society murder
Bring "back the noose" is always heard
Whenever those swine are under attack
But it won't make you even
It won't bring him back

Let him dangle
Let him dangle (String him up)
