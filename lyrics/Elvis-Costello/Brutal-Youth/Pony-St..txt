She lives on Pony St. And they should scatter flowers at her feet
But when they come calling, I think its appalling
Theyre sober and theyre polite
Theyre deeply respectful when I would expect them
To keep her out all night

That little martinet will get her own way
Yet, if you need instruction in mindless destruction
Ill show you a thing or two
You used to adore me but now my life flashes before me for you to view

Oh mother, oh mother, sometimes you are so mortifying
From the hole in your leopard skin tights, I can tell, youve been spying
But your generation confesses before it transgresses
Those 'Super-8' movies of daddy in your disco dresses

If youre going out tonight, I wont wait up
Reading 'Das Kapital', watching 'Home shopping club'
While youre flogging a dead horse, all the way down Pony St.
Where you live after a fashion, all the way down Pony St.

The life and the soul of every indiscretion
That lives on, that lives on, that lives on
Pony St.

Daughter, oh daughter, you know I will love you forever
But spare me the white ankle socks with the lace and the leather
For you and your cartoon threat, do no good to resist me
For I am the genuine thing, but for you, its just history

If youre going out tonight, how can you be sure
Where you lay your pretty head, mother may have been before
So youre flogging a dead horse, all the way down Pony St.
Where you live after a fashion, all the way down Pony St.

The life and the soul of every indiscretion
That lives on, that lives on
That lives on, that lives on
That lives on

She lives on Pony St.
She lives on Pony St.

She lives on, she lives on
She lives on, she lives on
