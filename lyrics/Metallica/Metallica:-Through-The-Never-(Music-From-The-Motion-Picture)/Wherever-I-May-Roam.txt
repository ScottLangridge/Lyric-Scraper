[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
(And the road becomes my Bride)
And the road becomes my Bride
I have stripped of all but Pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me Satisfied
Gives me all I need
And the dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, Wanderer
Nomad, Vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah !

[Chorus]
Ouuuhhh,
But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my Mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my Head is home, yeah !

[Verse 2]
(And the Earth becomes my Throne)
And the Earth becomes my Throne
I adapt to the Unknown
Under wandering Stars I have grown
By myself but not alone
I ask No One!
And my ties are severed clean
Less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, Wanderer
Nomad, Vagabond,
Call me what you will !
Yeah, you will !

[Chorus]
But I'll take my Time anywhere
I'm free to speak my Mind anywhere
And I never Mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my Head is home, I swear !

[Solo]


[Chorus]
But I'll take my Time anywhere
I'm free to speak my Mind anywhere
And I'll take my Time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my Head is home, that's right
Right here, right now !

[Solo]

[Chorus]
But I'll take my Time anywhere
I'm Free to speak my Mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my Head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lies, but still I roam,  yeah, yeah !

[Bridge]
Wherever I may roam,
Wherever I may roam, o-hooo !

[Outro]
Wherever I may roam,
Wherever I may roam, yeah !
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander!
Wherever I may roam, yeah ,yeah !
Wherever I may roam, yeah, yeah !
Wherever I may roam,
Wherever I may roam,
Wherever I may roam !!!
