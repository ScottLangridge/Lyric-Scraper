[Intro]
Give me Fuel, Give me Fire,
Give me that which I desire !!!
Ooh !!!

[Verse 1]
Turn on...I see red,
Adrenaline crash and crack my head,
Nitro Junkie, Paint me dead,
And I see red !!!

One hundred plus through Black and White,
War Horse, Warhead,
Fuck 'em Man, white-knuckle tight,
Through Black and White !!!

[Chorus 1]
Ohh, On I Burn,
Fuel is pumping engines,
Burning hard, loose and clean !!!

[Chorus 2]
And I burn,
Churning my direction,
Quench my thirst with Gasoline !!!

[Chorus 3]
So give me Fuel
Give me Fire
Give me that which I desire

Hey !!!

Turn on beyond the bone,
Swallow future, spit out home,
Burn your face upon the chrome,

Take the corner, join the crash,
Headlights, Headlines,
Another Junkie lives too fast,
Yeah, lives way too fast, fast, fast,
