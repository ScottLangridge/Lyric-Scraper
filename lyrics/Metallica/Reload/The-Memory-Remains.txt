Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane but the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honour
Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded Prima Donna
Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane
Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane but the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Fade to black
Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane (Sing it)
Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane
Dance little tin goddess

Drift away, fade away
Little tin goddess
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Fade to black
Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane (Sing it)
Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane but the memory remains
Ash to ash (Ash to ash), dust to dust (Dust to dust)
Fade to black (Fade to black), the memories remain, yeah
To this faded Prima Donna
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dance little tin goddess dance

Say yes, at least say hello
Say yes, at least say hello
