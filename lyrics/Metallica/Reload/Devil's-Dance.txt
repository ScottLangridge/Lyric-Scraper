Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns just free to you
That's running through
Deep inside you know, seeds I plant will grow
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah come on come on now take a chance
That's right, let's dance
Snake, I am a snake
Tempting, that bite you take
Let me make your mind, leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need, hunger I will feed
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now take a chance
Haha!
Come dance ah. Yeah, come dancin
(solo)One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah come on, come on now take a chance
(more solo)Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns just free to you
That's running through
Deep inside you know, seeds I plant will grow
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now take a chance
That's right, let's dance
Mm, Mm it's nice to see you here,
Haha!!!
