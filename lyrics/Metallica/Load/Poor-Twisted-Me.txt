Oh poor twisted me
Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

Swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery

Is just for oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery

Inhaling the deep dark blue
Oh woe is me
Such a burden to be
Poor mistreated me

To finally reach the shore
Survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold
The sea was warm
So warm
Your bathe your soul again
Bathe it again, and again, and again

To finally reach the shore
Survive the storm
Now you're bare and cold
The sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Good to see my friend
Oh woe is me
Such a burden to be
Oh poor twisted me
Oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted me
