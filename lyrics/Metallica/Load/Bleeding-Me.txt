[Verse 1]
I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to somethin'
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better...

[Verse 3]
I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted...

[Verse 4]
This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah!
And I bleed
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa!
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheels roll
Oh, the bleeding of me, yeahh yeahh !!!
Of me...

[Hook 2]
The bleeding of me...

[Instrumental-Bridge 1]

[Chorus]
Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my Soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa!
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheels roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Oh, the bleeding of me...

[Bridge]
Yeah!
I am the Priest that feeds the Beast
I am the Blood
I am Release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught
I'm caught Under !!!

[Chorus]
Caught under wheels roll
I take that leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
Oh, I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
Oh, the bleeding of me
Ooh, come on, baby!
