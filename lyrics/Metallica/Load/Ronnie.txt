Story starts, quiet town
Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But oh my god, how that all did change
Now they all pray, blood stains wash away
He said, "Lost my way, this bloody day, lost my way"
I heard him, he said, "Lost my way, this bloody day, lost my way"
All things wash away but blood stained the sun red today

I always said, "Somethin' wrong with little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles"
"Gallows calls" soon I say
Keep your smile but laugh all day
Think once again, in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
Now they all pray, blood stains wash away
He said, "Lost my way, this bloody day, lost my way"
I heard him, he said, "Lost my way, this bloody day, I lost my way"
All things wash away but blood stained the sun red today

Yeah, well all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face"
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket and they'd all fall down, down, down
He said, "Lost my way, this bloody day, lost my way"
I heard him, he screamed, "Lost my way, this bloody day, lost my way"
All things wash away but blood stained the sun red today

That's right, all things wash away
And they'd all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
Yeah, yeah, come along
All things wash away
And they'd all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
