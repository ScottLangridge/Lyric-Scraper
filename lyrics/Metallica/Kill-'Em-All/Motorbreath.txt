Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
It's hot and it's heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I'm taking down, you know, whatever's in my way
Getting your kicks as you're shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, same song and dance

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away
