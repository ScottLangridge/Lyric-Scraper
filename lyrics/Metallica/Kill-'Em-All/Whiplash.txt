Late at night
All systems go
You've come to see the show

We do our best
You're the rest
You make it real, you know

There's a feeling
Deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad

A feeling
Of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Whiplash!

Bang your head
Against the stage
Like you never did before

Make it ring
Make it bleed
Make it really sore

In a frenzied madness
With your leathers
And your spikes

Heads are bobbing
All around
It's hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Whiplash!

Here on stage
The Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears

It kicks your ass
Kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears

Now's the time
To let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose

We're gathered here
To maim and kill
Cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

[Bridge:]

Here we go!

(1st solo)

Whiplash!

(2nd solo)

The show is through
The metal's gone
It's time to hit the road

Another town
Another gig
Again we will explode

Hotel rooms
And motorways
Life out here is raw

We'll never stop
We'll never quit
Cause we're Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Ow, ow!
