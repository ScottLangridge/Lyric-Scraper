[Verse 1]
Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right.
There's someone else controlling me,
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

[Hook]
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"

[Chorus]
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

[Verse 2]
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of Death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

[Hook]
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

[Chorus]
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

[Bridge]
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

[Verse 3]
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

[Hook]
Wakened by a horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

[Chorus]
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame 

[Instrumental Outro]
