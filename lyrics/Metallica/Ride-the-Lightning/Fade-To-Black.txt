[Verse 1]
Life, it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free !!!

[Verse 2]
Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this Hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone !!!

[Guitar Bridge]

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself
But it's too late
Now I can't think
Think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say Goodbye ...
Goodbye !!!
