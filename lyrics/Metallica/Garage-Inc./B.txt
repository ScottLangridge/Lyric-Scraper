Breadfan
Open up your mind
Open up your purse
Open up your bones
Never never gonna lose it
Breadfan
Take it all away
Never give an inch
Got to make a mint
Got to make me a million
Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it in the end
Who is a fool
Seagull
You give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you want to be
Loser
Give it all away
Never stay with the winner
With the man
With all the filthy money
Come on
Keep it on the side
With a ride
On a record on the top
If you're gonna be a bad boy
Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it in the end
Who's a fool
Seagull
Give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be, ya
Breadfan
Open up your mind
Open up your purse
Open up your bones
Never, never gonna lose it
Breadfan
Take it all away
Never give an inch
Got to make a mint
Got to make me a million
Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it in the end
Who's a fool
Seagull
You give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you want to be
{Mommy, where's fluffy?}
