Huh!
I see that nothing's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular
Well, this is it, you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another John
I know what's going on
Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No! Too late, too late
I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
I think you see the joke
But you're just chasing smoke
You ain't another one
I know what's going on
Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh no! Too late, too late
Ooh!
Get on with it!
Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Ooh, I'm gonna hit and run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's going on
Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh no! Too late, too late
Ooh! Too late, too late
[Aaah...]
