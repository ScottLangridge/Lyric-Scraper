As I was going over
The Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver
Oh, or the devil he may take ya"

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah
And I brought it home to Molly

She swore that she loved me
No, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah,
For you know she tricked me easy

Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' Molly with me
But I never knew the danger

For about six or maybe seven
In walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols
And I shot him with both barrels, yeah!

Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da, yeah, yeah!
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Yeah, whiskey, yo, ho whiskey...

Oh-oh, whoa, whoa, yo!

Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

Now some men like a fishin'
Some men like the fowlin'
Some men like to hear
To hear the cannonball a-roarin'

Me? I like sleepin'
'Specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da, hey, yeah!
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o, yeah!

Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah!

Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da
Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da, hey!
Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da
Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da, yeah!
