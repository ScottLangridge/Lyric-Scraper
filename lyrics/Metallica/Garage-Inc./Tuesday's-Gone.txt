(Originally recorded by Lynyrd Skynyrd)
Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far, far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I'm leaving my woman at home
My baby's gone
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
And I don't know where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, i'll try again
I'm leaving my woman at home
My baby's gone
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
And My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, Tuesday's gone
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone, long gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, many miles from my home
See, I'm riding my blues away
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free
But somehow, I've got you to carry on
My Baby's gone
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone, long gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on
Train roll on
Ride on train
Ride on train
Ride on train
Train roll on
(train roll on)
Train, it rolls on
Train roll on
Oh, I can change
Oh, I can change
Oh, I can change
Oh, I can change
Train roll on
Train roll on
Ride on train
Oh, I can change
Train roll on
Ride on Train
Lord I can change
Oh, I can change
Roll on train
