Sleepin' very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreamin'
I was Al Capone
Rumors goin' 'round
Gotta clear outta town
Smellin' like
A dry fish bone
Here come the law
Gonna break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never never never
Want it any more
Gotta get away from
The stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy ya know

Rainy afternoon
On a killer typhoon
Playin' on my slide trombone
Anymore anymore cannot
Take it anymore
Gotta get away from
The stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy ya know
Hey!

[Guitar Solo]

Walkin' down the street
Shootin' people that I meet
Fully loaded tommy gun
Here come the deputy
Tryin' fuckin' gettin' me
Gotta fuckin' get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I run right outta juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Lemme go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy ya know
Yeah
