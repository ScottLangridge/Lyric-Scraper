Dear mother
Dear father
What is this hell
You have put me through?

Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out
Lived my life through you

Pushed onto me
What's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing
That they call life

Dear mother
Dear father
Every thought
I'd think you'd disapprove

Curator, dictator
Always censoring
My every move

Children are seen
But are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me
Without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

Dear mother
Dear father
Time has frozen still
What's left to be?

Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact
I think for me

No guarantee
It's life as is
But damn you
For not giving me my chance

Dear mother
Dear father
Clipped my wings
Before I learned to fly

Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown
That fucking lullaby

Same thing
I've always heard from you
Do as I say
Not as I do

Innocence
Torn from me
Without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

(Solo)

I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim
Please rescue me

Dear mother
Dear father
Hidden in your world
You've made for me

I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me
That never heal

Undying spite
I feel for you
Living out this hell
You always knew...
