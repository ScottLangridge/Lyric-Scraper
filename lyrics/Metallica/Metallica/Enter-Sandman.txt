[Verse 1]
Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in
Warm within
Keep you free from sin
Until the Sandman he comes !!!

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open,
Gripping your pillow tight !!!

[Chorus]
Exit Light
Enter Night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land !!!

[Verse 2]
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war
Dreams of liars
Dreams of Dragons Fire
And of things that will bite, yeah !!!

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open,
Gripping your pillow tight !!!

[Chorus]
Exit Light
Enter Night
Take my hand,
We're off to Never Never-land !!!

[Solo]

My friends, put you hands like this man !!!

[Spoken Interlude: James Hetfield & Bob Rock's Son]
Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
And
If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake 
'If I die before I wake'
I pray the lord my soul to take
'I pray the lord my soul to take'

[Bridge]
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard,
It's just the Beast under your bed
In your closet, in your Head !!!

[Chorus]
Exit, light
Enter Night
Grain of sand
Exit Light
Enter Night
Take my hand,
We're off to Never Never-land !!!

Come on people !!!
Hey, yeah !!!
Oh, oh, yeah !!!

[Outro]
We're off to never never-land ...

Take my hand !!!
We're off to never never-land ...
Take my hand !!!
We're off to never never-land ...
