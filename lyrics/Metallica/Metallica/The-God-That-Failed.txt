[Verse 1]
Pride you took, Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd Kneel
Not the Word, Not the Love
Not what you Thought from above

[Pre-Chorus]
It Feeds, it Grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you Believe

[Chorus]
I see Faith in your Eyes
Never you hear the discouraging Lies
I hear Faith in your Cries
Broken is the Promise, Betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened Nail
Follow the God that Failed 

[Verse 2]
Find your Peace, find your Say
Find the smooth road in your Way
Trust you gave, a child to Save
Left you Cold and him in Grave 

[Pre-Chorus]
It Feeds, it Grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you Believe 

[Chorus]
I see Faith in your Eyes
Never you hear the discouraging Lies
I hear Faith in your Cries
Broken is the Promise, Betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened Nail
Follow the God that Failed 

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Chorus]
I see Faith in your Eyes
Broken is the Promise, Betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened Nail
Follow the God that Failed 

[Verse 3]
Pride you took, Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd Kneel
Trust you gave, a child to Save
Left you Cold and him in Grave

[Chorus]
I see faith in your Eyes
Never you hear the discouraging Lies
I hear Faith in your Cries
Broken is the Promise, Betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the God that failed 

[Outro]
Follow the God that Failed, yeah !!!
Broken is the Promise, Betrayal !!!
Betrayal, yeah !!!
