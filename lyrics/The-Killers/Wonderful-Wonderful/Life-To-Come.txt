I didn't see this coming, I admit it
But if you think I'll buckle forget it
I told you that I'd be the one
I'll be there in the life to come

You think I lost my vision but I didn't
It sounds like heaven but it isn't
Through fields of amber we will run
Somewhere in the life to come

This is not a shakedown
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me, girl
Just dropkick the shame
Uncover your face, girl
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me
Just dropkick the shame

Call my name
Call my name
If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come

I know sometimes you think that I regret it
But I don't remember stumbling when I said it
I told you that I'd be the one
I was talking about the life to come

I know it ain't a cakewalk (I'm not gonna back down)
Let go of the blame (let go of the blame)
Have a little faith in me, girl
Just dropkick the shame

If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come

If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come

Or the life to come
If you call my name
If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come

This is not a shakedown (this is not a shakedown)
Let go of the blame (let go of the blame)
Have a little faith in me, girl (have a little faith in me)
Just dropkick the shame (dropkick the shame)
