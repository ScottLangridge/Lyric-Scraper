And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meet in the house, behold
Many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples
Why eateth your Master with publicans and senators?
But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them
They that be whole need not a physician
But they that are sick

I walked into town with a message for my old man
I got the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand
Steve's painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy, he stayed the same

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother just lean into the light
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother just lean in to the light

His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back
(Here comes the calling)
But daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost?
(Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they fix it all up in post

The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Keys to the kingdom

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The lord of the kingdom's burning bright
Brother just lean into the light
(Lean in)

You heard that the master was travelin' through
But what would you do if he walked in the room?
Pray to the left, pray to the right
Brother just lean in
Brother just lean into the light

Follow the sun out of the night
Brother just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I'll give you sight
Brother just lean in to the light
(Just lean into the light)
The lord of the kingdom's burning bright
Brother just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother just lean into the light

(Here comes the calling)
(Here comes the calling)
