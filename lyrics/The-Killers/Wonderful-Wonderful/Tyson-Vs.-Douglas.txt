Looking out the window out on the street
I don't know what happened, I'm out on my feet
I hear my mother calling my name
I still come running but I ain't the same

You can change the channel
Take the phone off the hook
Avoid the headline but you'll never grow up baby if you don't look

When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath till the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears

You're used to winning, how did it feel?
Did you hear the screaming? It was unreal
What did they pay you? What did it cost?
How long did it take you to know that you lost?

You can hit the shower
Fill the place up with steam
And close the curtains
But when you woke up, man, it wasn't no dream

When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath till the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes, close my eyes 
Just to stop the tears

Looking out the window out on the street
My boy and his mother and I think of me
I'm feeling the slip again, I don't wanna fall
You said it was nothing
But maybe you're wrong

'Cause when I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath till the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tear
Just to stop the tears
Just to stop the tears
