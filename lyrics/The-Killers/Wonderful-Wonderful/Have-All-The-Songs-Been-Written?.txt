Have all the songs been written?
Have all the truths been told?
Has all the gas been siphoned?
Do the plains still carry gold?
Has every ship gone sailing?
Has every heart gone blue?

Have all the songs been written?
Oh, I just need one
To get through to you, I
Just need one more

Have all the songs been written?
Have all your needs been met?
Have all these years been worth it?
Or am I the great regret?

Has every ship gone sailing?
Has every heart gone blue?
Have all the songs been written?

Oh, I just need one
To get through to you, I
Just need one more, to get through to you, I
Can't take back, what I've done wrong, I
Just need one more

When the train returns to the rails
When the ship is back in the harbor
I will make you happy again
I can see a life for you and I

Just need one more, to get through to you, I
Just need one more, to get through to you, I
Can't take back, what I've done wrong, I
Just need one more
