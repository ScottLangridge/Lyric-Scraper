A little birdie whispered in my ear
You been cooking up a world of fear
Put your hands in things you shouldn't have known
You was riding in the danger zone
Well you had us all fooled with your quarter back smile
And your crocodile tears there for a while
Got my paradigm shifting man you're making me shout

Hey from here on out
Friends are going to be hard to come by
Left us wondering what it all was about
You had it easy man you chose the hard way
Down that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
From here on out

Should I pass over the side and cross?
You may wonder what the trouble cost
That don't matter now life goes on
Hallelujah the trouble's gone
No sense in holding grudges in this 32 years
These are things I must learn to practice while I live
Got my paradigm shifting man you're making me shout

Hey from here on out
Friends are going to be hard to come by
Left us wondering what was it was all about
You had it easy man chose the hard way
Walk that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
Hey from here on out
Let the people pull the peace sign...
You left wondering what it's all about
You been denied but you carried it with ya
Down that old lonely road in a shadow of a doubt
Yeah from here on out
