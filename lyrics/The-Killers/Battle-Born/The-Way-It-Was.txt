I drove through the desert last night
I carried the weight of our last fight

Don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

[Hook:]
If I go on with you by my side
Can it be the way it was?
When we met did you forget about those golden eyes?

Maybe a thief stole your heart
Maybe we just drifted apart

I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blinking on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

[Hook:]
If I go on with you by my side
Can it be the way it was?
When we met did you forget about those golden eyes?

All of our plans have fallen through
Sometimes a dream don't come true
