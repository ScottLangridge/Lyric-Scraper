Be still, go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead.
And life is short, to say the least.
We're in the belly of the beast.

Be still, wild and young.
Long may your innocence reign, 
Like shells on the shore
May your limits be unknown, may your efforts be your own

If you ever feel you can't take it anymore, 

Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream?
Rise up like the sun, labor till the work is done.

Be still, one day you'll leave
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see? (what did you see?)
Was there something out there for me?

Be still, close your eyes. 
Soon enough you'll be on your own.
Steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud, it doesn't change what's in your
Blood.
Over rock, over chain, over trap, over plain.

When they knock you down

Don't break character. You've got a lot of heart.
Is this real or just a dream?

Be still. Be still.
Be still. Be still.

Over rock and chain, over sunset plain.
Over trap and snare
When you're in too deep
In your wildest dreams, in your made up schemes

When they knock you down (when they knock you down)

Don't break character. You've got so much heart.
Is this real or just a dream?

Rise up like the sun, and labor till the work is done. 3x
