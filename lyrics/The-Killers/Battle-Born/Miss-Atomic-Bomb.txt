You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever
I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter
Oblivious to school girls lives
When I look back, upon those neon lights
You'll never see the passage right
I feel the heat, I see the light, the Miss Atomic Bomb

We're making out without the radio on
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

It's a challenge in the moonlight
Getting bitter on a hot night
You are the secondary one
You're innocent and young

Aaaah

We camped out of the night
And you've got a foolish heart
So you took your place for the hard old place
It's the hardest part

Miss Atomic Bomb
We're making out without the radio on
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

It's a challenge in the moonlight
Lets take a chance into the hot night
Let's go to secondary one
Yeah we were innocent and young

My eyes are clear
But sometimes a dream's

Miss Atomic Bomb
And I'm standing here
My skin

And this love that I cradle
Is weighing thin
But I'm standing here
