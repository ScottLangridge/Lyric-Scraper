The streets of persuasion
Are plated with gold
Your heart's in the right place, 
But you travel down the wrong road
Like so many before you
The gates open wide

Here comes the rising tide

Let's go away, tonight
There's a mystery underneath those neon lights
Until life and dream collide
Cause the truth's gonna come and cut you open wide
And you can't escape the rising of the tide

Keep up your appearance, you join the choir
With everybody singing out
Glory Hallejuah
The songs get you nowhere
There's nowhere to hide

Here comes the rising tide

And the company you keep
Well they plan your crucifiction as we speak
So, baby til life and dream collide
There's gonna be a mystery underneath those neon lights
You'll petition. but your access was denied
And you can't escape the rising of the tide

Can you tell me bro was I deceived, or in denial?
I was there, on the back of the room, when you testified
When you took the stand, you licked your lips, and you lied
Until life and dream collide
Well I gotta belive there's something on my side
When the venom in your veins is satisfied
You'll be running, but there ain't no where to hide

You can't escape
(You can't escape)
You can't escape
(You can't escape)
You can't escape the rising of the tide
