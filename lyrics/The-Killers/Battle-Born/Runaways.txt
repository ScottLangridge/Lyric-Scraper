Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind&#8232;
A blue eyed girl playing in the sand&#8232;
I've been on a trail for a little while&#8232;
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand&#8232;
Teenage rush, she said, ain't we all just runaways&#8232;
We got time&#8232;
But that ain't much
&#8232;&#8232;
We can't wait till tomorrow&#8232;
You gotta know that this is real baby&#8232;
Why you wanna fight it
&#8232; It's the one thing you can choose
Oh!

&#8232;&#8232; We got engaged on a friday night
&#8232; I swore on the head of our unborn child&#8232;
That I could take care of the three of us
&#8232; But I have the tendency to slip when the night's still wild
&#8232; It's in my blood&#8232;
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
&#8232; Someplace good&#8232;&#8232;

We can't wait till tomorrow&#8232;
You gotta know that this is real baby&#8232;
Why you wanna fight it&#8232;
It's the one thing you can choose
&#8232;&#8232;
Let's take a chance baby we can't lose&#8232;
Ain't we all just runaways
&#8232; I knew it when I met you
&#8232; I'm not gonna let you&#8232;
Runaway&#8232;
I knew it when I had you&#8232; I wasn't letting go&#8232;&#8232;

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams&#8232;
Hold each other till the morning light
&#8232; We used to laugh now we only fight
&#8232; Baby are you lonesome now&#8232;&#8232;

And then I come after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I'll haunt this halls&#8232;
There's a picture of us on our wedding day&#8232;
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in this walls&#8232;&#8232;

We can't wait till tomorrow
&#8232; Now we're caught up in the appeal baby why you wanna hide it
&#8232; It's the last day on my mind
&#8232; I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive
&#8232;&#8232; Ain't we all just runaways
&#8232; I knew it when I met you
&#8232; I'm not gonna let you&#8232; Runaway
&#8232; I knew it when I had you&#8232;
I wasn't letting go
