Racy days
Help me through the hopeless haze
But my, Oh my
Tragic eyes
I can't even recognize myself behind
So if the answer is no,
Can I change your mind?

Out again, a siren screams at half past ten
And you won't let go
While I ignore, that we both felt like this before
It starts to show
So if I have a chance
Would you let me know?

Why aren't you shaken
Sit back and sigh
Graciously taken
Oh you're too kind

And if the answer is no,
Can I change your mind?

We're all the same,
And love is blind
The sun is gone
Before it shines

And I said if the answer is no,
Can I change your mind?
