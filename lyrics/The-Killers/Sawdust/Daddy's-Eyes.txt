Daddy's Eyes

I'll tell you what you wanna know
But boy you better listen close
People gonna tell you lies
Don't let it come as a surprise
That woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
But you began to realize
You know got your daddy's eyes

And there's something I wanna say
I love her too
And all of this has got nothing to do with you
And I'd like to stay but I can't because
I've been fooling around
And I know that you called because
you never even knew that it was hurting me
When you put it on the other hand
When you're old enough to understand
That glove will bring it all to life
I didn't say that made it right

Cause that woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
When you begin to realize
You know got your daddy's eyes

And there's something I wanted to say
I love her too
And all of this has got nothing to do with you

And I'd like to stay but I can't
Because I've been fooling around
And I know that you called
Cause you never even knew that it was hurting me

And I'd like to stay but I can't
because I've been fooling around
And I know that you called
Because you never even knew that it was hurting me

Sometimes people get tired
And I woke up a little too late to lie
Dreams should last a long time
This is not what I'd call goodbye

And I'd love to stay but I can't
because I've been fooling around
And I know that you called
because you never even knew that it was hurting me

And I'd love to stay but I can't
Because I've been fooling around
And I know that you called
Because you never even knew that it was hurting me
Me

I love her too
