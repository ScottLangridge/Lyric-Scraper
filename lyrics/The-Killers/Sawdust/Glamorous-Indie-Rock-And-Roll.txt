Glamorous indie rock and roll,
Is what I want.
It's in my soul,
It's what I need.
Indie rock and roll, it's time.
Two of us,
Flippin' through a thrift store magazine
She's plays the drums, I'm on tambourine.
Bet ya, ya bottom dollar I'm mean.

It's indie rock and roll for me.
It's indie rock and roll for me.
It's all I need.
It's indie rock and roll for me.

In the clutch
Of talkin' every word for all the boys,
Electric girls with worn down toys.
Makin' up breakin' up.
What do you care?
Oh what do you care?

I take my twist with a shout,
A coffee shop with a cause
Man I'll freak you out.
No s**, no drugs, no luck, no love
When it comes to today.

Stay, if you wanna love me stay.
Oh don't be shy,
Lets cause a scene.
Like lovers do
On silver screens
Lets make it yeah, we'll cause a scene.

It's indie rock and roll for me.
It's indie rock and roll for me.
It's all I need.
It's indie rock and roll for me.

(In the clutch

It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need.
(Oooooooo)
Makin' up breakin' up
What do you care?
It's indie rock and roll for me
(Oooo, two of us
Flippin through a thrift store magazine)
It's indie rock and roll for me.
It's all I need.
(Oooooooooooooo)
Makin' up breakin' up
What do you care?
It's indie rock and roll for me.
