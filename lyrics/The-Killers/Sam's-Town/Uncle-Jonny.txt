When everybody else refrained,
My uncle Jonny did cocaine
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey Jonny...
Hey what you say Jonny?

I wanna go out tonight
Come a little closer to the city lights
Levitation ain't your only friend
Levitation coming back again

You feel the burning in your body's core
It's a yearning that you can't ignore
And I wanna go out tonight
So trust the superman and hold on tight
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey Jonny...
Hey what you say Jonny?

My appetite ain't got no heart
I say my appetite ain't got no heart
Shocking people when you feel that pull
Shock 'em jump 'em when you know it's full
I feel a burning in my body core
It's a yearning that you can't ignore
And I gotta go out tonight
"Hey Jonny I've got faith in ya man!
I mean it, it's gonna be all right"
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey Jonny...
Hey what you say Jonny?

Tell us what's going on
Feels like everything's wrong
Hey what you say Jonny?
If the future is real, Jonny you've got to heal
Hey what you say Jonny?

When everybody else refrained,
My uncle Jonny did cocaine
