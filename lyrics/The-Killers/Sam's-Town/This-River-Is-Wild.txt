The leaves are falling down on the beautiful ground
I heard a story from the man in red
He said the leaves are falling down
Such a beautiful sound
Son, I think you better go ahead

But you always hold your head up high
Cause it's a long, long, long way down
This town was meant for passing through
Boy, it ain't nothin' new
Now go and show 'em that the world stayed round
But it's a long, long, long way down

You better run for the hills before they burn

Listen to the sound of the world
Then watch it turn
I just wanna show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go

Or I should I just get along with myself
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here
All night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
This river is wild
This river is wild...


Run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world
Then watch it turn but shake a little
Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk and shake a little
Sometimes I hate the line I walk

I just wanna show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go

Or I should I just get along with myself
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here
All night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Because this river is wild
Godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild

Now Adam's taking bombs
And he's stuck on his mom
Because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
He's with the hippie in the park
Comin' over the dark
Just trying to get some of that little girl play

You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world
Then watch it turn

I just wanna show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go

Or I should I just get along with myself
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here
All night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
The pain is hell in me tonight
Because this river is wild
Godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild
This river is wild
Godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild

Now the cars are everywhere
Face the dust at the fairground
I don't think I've ever seen so many headlights
But there's something pulling me
The circus and their crew
Well they're just passing through
Making sure that merry still goes 'round
But it's a long, long, long way down
