(Come with me)
We took a back road, we're gonna look at the stars
We took a back road in my car
Down to the ocean, it's only water and sand
And in the ocean, we'll hold hands
But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed
In the best put on the heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry

Don't you wanna come with me?
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural

A cinematic vision, ensued
Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling, an angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
"Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine"
And it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them
When the dead of night, comes calling
Save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

Don't you wanna come with me?
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me?
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
It's only natural
I never had a lover (I never had a lover)
I never had soul (I never had soul)
I never had a good time (And I never had a good time)
I never got gold (I never got gold)

Don't you wanna come with me?
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me?
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
It's only natural

Don't you wanna come with me?
Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It's only natural
Come and take a swim with me?
Don't you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
It's only natural
