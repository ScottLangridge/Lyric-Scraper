Agressively
We all defend the role we play
Regrettably
Times come to send you on your way

We've seen it all
Bonfires of trust
Flash floods of pain

It doesn't really matter
Don't you worry it'll all work out
No, it doesn't even matter
Don't you worry that ain't what it's all about

We hope you enjoyed your stay
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
We hope you enjoyed your stay
Outside the sun is shining
It seems like heaven ain't far away
It's good to have you with us
... Even if it's just for the day

It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
Outside the sun is shining
It seems like Heaven ain't far away

It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
Outside the sun is shining
It seems like Heaven ain't far away
It seems like Heaven ain't far away
It seems like Heaven ain't far away
