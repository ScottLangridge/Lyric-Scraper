(Words by Van Halen)

You've got me captured
I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture
Yes I know it well
Another page is turned

Are you for real?
It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait
'Til your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way
You can stop me now
As fine as you are

I wrote a letter
And told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it
She wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me

And while she watches
I can never be free
Such good photography

I'll wait
'Til your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way
You can stop me now
As fine as you are

(Guitar Solo)

You can't imagine
What your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic free
To everyone who reads
Heartbreakin' motor drive

Are you for real?
It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait
'Til your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way
You can stop me now
As fine as you are

I'll wait
'Til your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way
You can stop me now
As fine as you are

I'll wait
