(Words by Van Halen)

Ow!
Drop dead legs
Pretty smile
Hurts my head
Gets me wild

Dig that steam
Giant butt
Makes me scream
I get a nut nut nuthin
But the shakes over you
(Nothin) Nothin' else could ever do

You know that you want it (Woo!)
I know what you need
You know that you want it (Baby!)
When the night is through
Will I still be lovin' you? (Woo!)

Dig those moves
Vampire
Set me loose
Get it higher

Throw my rope
Loop-de-loop
Nice white teeth; Betty Boop
Play it cool,
Real heavy
I ain't fooled
Get it ready
Ooh, oh baby!

You know that you want it (oh, oh oh)
I know what you need (Ooh!)
You know that you want it (Baby)
When the night is through, (Ow!)
Will I still be lovin' you? (Uh!)
