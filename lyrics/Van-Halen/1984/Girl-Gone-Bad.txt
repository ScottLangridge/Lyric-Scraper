(Words by Van Halen)

Ah, lazy eyes in the summer heat
Fresh from out of town
Now she's working on the street
Shake them poor boys down

Woo (Girl) Woo, Girl gone bad, ye-ah
(Girl) Girl gone bad

Found that girl with a lonesome john
When she should have been with me
Guess that woman fall in love
She don't work for free

(Girl) Girl gone bad
Yeah
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ooooooo-oh!
Ooooo-oh!
Oh!

(Guitar Solo)

Mmmmmmmmmmm...
Ah

(Girl) Girl gone bad
Whoa! (Girl) Girl gone bad
Ow! Yeah (Girl) Girl, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Girl) Ooooh. Oh! Oh! Yeah!
Aw! (Girl) Say. Say. Uh!
