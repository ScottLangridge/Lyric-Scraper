At night I walk this stinkin' street
Past the crazies on my block
And I see the same old faces
And I hear that same old talk
And I'm searchin' for the latest thing
A break in this routine
I'm talkin' some new kicks
Ones like you ain't never seen

This is home, this is mean street
Yes ah home, the only one I know
(This is home)

An' we don't worry 'bout tomorrow
'Cause we're sick of these four walls
Now what you think is nothin'
Might be somethin' after all
Now you know this ain't no through street
The end is dead ahead
The poor folks play for keeps down here
They're the livin' dead

Come on down, down to mean street
(Huh ow)
(This is)
They're dancin' now, out on mean street
(Look)
Dance baby

It's always here and now my friend
It ain't once upon a time
It's all over but the shoutin'
I come to take what's mine
We're searchin' for the latest thing
A break in this routine
Talkin' some new kicks
Ones like you ain't never seen

This is home, this is mean street
(Ooh)
Yes ah home, only one I know
(This is home)

(This is home)
See, a gun is real easy
(This is mean street)
In this desperate part of town
(This is home)
Turns you from hunted into hunter, yeah
(This is mean street)
You go an' hunt somebody down
Wait a minute, ah
(This is home)
Somebody said "Fair warning, Lord"
(This is mean street)
Lord, strike that poor boy down
