(Words by Van Halen)

Ow, yeah
Now check me out on the good side here
Well my baby's on the corner and she's lookin' so fine
Put one and one together and it blowed my mind
A man needs love to live, I'm the livin' proof
Catch that smile and I hit the roof

Big double take, but ya keep on walkin', uh!
I'm in love
Once over, I'm over done

So this is love?
Ooh I need your lovin', come on baby, take me home
So this is love?
Ooh I need your lovin', I'm just skin an' bone

Goin' outta my way, know my way around
The grass is never greener an' there plenty around
All the other girls, they be put to shame
Over the edge and here I stay

Got me on pins and needles, and she knows
She's mine and, ain't lettin' go

So this is love?
Ooh I need your love, baby take me home
So this is love?
Ooh I need your lovin', I know

(Guitar Solo)

Ow! Got me on pins and needles, yes she knows
She's mine and, ain't lettin' go

So this is love?
Ooh I need your love. Whaa, yeah!
So this is love?
Ooh I need your love!
Ahh yeah! Baby, got ta have your love
Ooh I, Ooh I need, got to have that love
Baby, baby, wha-ha-ha! Still love
So this is love?
So this is love?
Ow! Wow! Woo!
