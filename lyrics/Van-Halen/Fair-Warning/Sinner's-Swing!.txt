(Words by Van Halen)

Woo!
Alright, you sinners, swing!

Danger in the rearview mirror, there's trouble in the wind
Badness bringing up the rear, the menace is loose again
She looks so fucking good, so s*** and so frail
Something got the bite on me, I'm goin' straight to hell

(And now we're wasting time) Now we're wasting time
(Same ol' pickup lines) Same ol' pickup lines
And you keep tryin', (Wow!) don't waste time

Ow, come back to your senses baby, we can come to terms
I can almost t-taste it, it burns
You'd be sittin' pretty but you try to take the fifth
Wearin' out my welcome, guess I better save my breath. Wow!

(And now we're wastin' time) Now we're wastin' time
(Same ol' pickup lines) Same ol' pickup lines
(And you keep tryin') Buddy you keep tryin'
Don't waste time

Get-get-get-get-get out and push
Get-get-get-get-get out and push
Get-get-get-get-get out and push
Get-get-get-get-get out and push

(Guitar Solo)

Get-get-get-get-get out and push
Get-get-get-get-get out and push
Get-get-get-get-get out and push
Get-get-get-get-get out and push

Soon you'll see my silhouette a-darkening your door
I can almost t-taste it, I want more
No one's above suspicion, no one's got it wired
I may burn my fingers, want my iron in that fire

(And now we're wastin' time) Ow! Now we're wastin' time
(Same ol' pickup lines) Same ol' pick up lines
(And you keep tryin') Buddy you keep tryin'
Don't waste time

(Wow!) Get-get-get-get-get out and push (Hey, buddy better... Get out and push)
Get-get-get-get-get out and push (Get get get get out and push)
Get-get-get-get-get out and push (Buddy, better. Get out and push)
Get-get-get-get-get out and push (Woo! Oh!)
Get-get-get-get-get out and push (Oh-whee)
Get-get-get-get-get out and push (All right you sinners, swing!)
