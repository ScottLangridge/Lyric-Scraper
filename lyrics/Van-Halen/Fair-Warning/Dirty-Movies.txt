(Words by Van Halen)

Ow, yeah
Oh, oh. Oh!
La!
Now, who's that babe with the fabulous shadow-ah?
Oh oh! A "so what?" scene, but to me it don't matter

Ow! Her movies get down like you won't find in my hometown
(Oh, no!) They won't believe it when they
(Oh, no!) See what they're seein'
Go see baby now!

Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing you've ever seen
Now her name is up in lights
Everything turns out all right

Daddy's little sweety after some damn rainbow
Oh, oh! Got the big deal in the back of a limo, uh hey

Now show biz is so thrilling
The camera rolls, she's willing
(Oh, no!) They won't believe it when they
(Oh, no!) See what they're seein'
Go see baby now-ah!

Hey, you remember when that girl was prom queen? (Oh, wow)
Take it off! Take it all off!
Whooo! Ow! Woo! Aw, yeah!
Woo! Woo! Ow! Yeah!

Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing you've ever seen
Now her name is up in lights (Woo!)
Everything turns out all right

Now they believe it
Now that they've seen it
Go see baby now! Ah, ha-ha!

Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing you've ever seen
Now her name is up in lights
Everything turns out all right

Lights, camera, action!
