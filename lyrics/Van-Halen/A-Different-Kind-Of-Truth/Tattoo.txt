I got elvis on my elbow
And when I flex elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
And she hulas when I walk

Speak in cherry red
Screaming electric green
Purple mountain's majesty really talk to me
Talk to me babe

Show me your dragon magic
(Tattoo, tattoo)
So autobiographic!

Best believe that need will hurt you
Best deceive these true colors that follow one of your false virtues

Here's a secret to make you think
Why is the crazy stuff we never said poetry in ink
Speak in day-glow red
Explodo paint
Purple mountain's majesty show me you, I'll show you me

S*** dragon magic

So very autobiographic!

Got a hold on me
(Tattoo, tattoo)
You put a spell on meee!

Uncle danny had a coal tattoo
He fought for the unions
Some of us still do
On my shoulder is a number of the chapter he was in
That number is forever like the struggle here to win

Everybody!
