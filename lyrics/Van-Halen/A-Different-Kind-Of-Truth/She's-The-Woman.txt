There goes an... I got a... 
There really something else to see
So many lock place
Ho there can't be just for me

I'm gonna change the time
And ever know I think I... 
There go! 
I know she's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman

... in every way
Baby please
I'd better love the free times
Baby see

I'm gonna change her time
And let he know I'll be there
And know know know
She's the woman, she's the woman

I don't wanna love the... in every way
Be there see
... times, be there please

I'm gonna change her time
And let he know I'll be there
I know o know know
She's the woman, I know
She's the woman, I know
She's the woman, I know
