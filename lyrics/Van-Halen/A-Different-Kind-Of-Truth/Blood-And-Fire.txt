Always tell the weirdos...
I'mma lose the vision...
I'm gonna live...
Come back like...
If I can feel the thunder
One hundred a time!

Chorus:
Oh yeah, we came, we came, we came
Through blood and fire
Oh yeah, we came, we came, we came
Through blood and fire

Now look at other people
Yeah, tonight!
It's a world of foes
I just... Expecting
None of them know it,
Or even suspected...
Put so many of them high
