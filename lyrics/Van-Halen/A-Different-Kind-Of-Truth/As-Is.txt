Yesterday I was a bum and broke, 
Today I am a star and broke
In this town that's called progress
That's how we do biz! 

I've been rich and I've been poor
Rich is better, totally better
Required degree of acceptance, 
Is must accept "As Is"

Drive my search engine home
Dropped and chopped in Alabama chrome
Hey what the hell it runs, oh
The day is dunzo
Let's have some funzo

Yours very truly, 
As is
 
How expensive he was
Or what was he worth?
Ain't no Brinks truck
Following no hearse.
 
Drive my search engine home.
Dropped, chopped, Alabama chrome.
Hey what the hell it runs, so... 
The day is dunzo
Let's have some funzo.
Yours very truly, 
 -As Is.
 
This next part should really confuse things.
Everybody let's stay focused.
 
Love of the craft
Or love of the buck?
Every day down here's a rainy day.
We don't save up.
 
[Solo]
 
A little more volume in the headphones please... 
 
Unspoiled by progress, 
"As Is" is how I follow through.
It's not who you squeeze
But who returns once again to squeeze you, no doubt! 
Love 'em all I says.
Let Cupid sort 'em out! 
 
Drive my search engine home.
Dropped, chopped, Alabama chrome.
Hey what the hell it runs, so... 
The day is dunzo
Let's have some funzo.
Yours very truly, 
As Is.
 
Love of the craft
Or love of the buck?
Every day down here's a rainy day
We don't save up.
 
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
(Repeat and fade)
