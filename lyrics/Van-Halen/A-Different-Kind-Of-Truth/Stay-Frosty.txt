I journeyed to the North
To hear what the preacher said
"your arms are too short to box with God,
Learn these words instead"
Gold tooth reflected
My advice is free
There's a trick to Christian values and it's compulsory.

Stay frosty
That's what the preacher man said
Stay Frosty
His words still racket in my head
Can't control your future
Can't control your friends
In a world without ends...
Stay Frosty!

I travelled to the South
The ancient Rabbi appeared to me
Voice heavy with the sands of time
He made me see
Same as Kabalah Dave but for you it's free
God guides us on our journey
But be careful where you put your feet

Stay Frosty
In a world without end
Stay Frosty
Like the ancient immortals said
Don't want em to get your goat
Don't show em where it's hid and that's just what I did
Stay Frosty!

I looked to the East
I struggled to stay afloat
A solitary Buddhist Monk
Threw me a rope
Looked me in the eye and said
Don't make me say this twice
You want to be a monk, you gotta cook a lot of rice

Stay Frosty
In a world without end
Stay Frosty
Work hard at this my friends
Look beyond the Kung Fu fighting
God is love
Best get it in writing

I wandered out West
To the California Coast
Where the folks who know about frostiness stay frostiest the most
My brand new landlord
Proposed me a toast, "My West Coast host"

Stay Frosty
Chant it like a Mantra
Stay Frosty
And there's nothing you can't handle
Far and wide far as you can handle
Trust in Allah
But tie up your camel, and remember...
Stay Frosty!
