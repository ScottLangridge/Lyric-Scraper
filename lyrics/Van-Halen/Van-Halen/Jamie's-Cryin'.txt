(Words by Van Halen)

She saw the look in his eyes
N' she knew better
He wanted her tonight
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin' Now Jamie wouldn't say all right
She knew he'd forget her
N' so they said ah-good night
Oh, and now he's gone forever

She wants to send him a letter, uh yeah yeah
Uh, just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (Gimme a call sometime)"
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie's been in love before (Ahh-ahh)
And she knows what love is for (Ahh-ahh)
It should mean a little, a little more (Ahh-ahh)
Than one night stands. Woo!
