(Words by Van Halen)

Sshha!
They may talk about you cold when you were
Headed for the skies
But you were young and bold, and baby
Didn't that change with a wink-a your eye

Now no one's talking 'bout those crazy days gone by
No one talks about the times you cried

(Oooh-oooh) Little dreamer
(Oooh-oooh) Little dreamer

And then they went and they voted you
Least likely to succeed
I had to tell them baby you were armed with all you'd need

Seems no one's talking 'bout those crazy days gone past
Weren't they amazed when you were really last?

(Oooh-oooh) You are the little dreamer
(Oooh-oooh) You were, the little dreamer. Yeah-yeah!

(Guitar Solo)

Yeah, they talk about you cold when you were
Headed for the skies
But you were young and bold, and baby
Didn't that change with a wink o' your eye

Seems no one's talkin' 'bout the crazy days gone past
Weren't they amazed when you were really last?

(Oooh-oooh) You are the little dreamer
(Oooh-oooh) Little dreamer, yeah. Oh-oh
(Oooh-oooh) Yeah. Little dreamer
(Oooh-oooh) Little dreamer
