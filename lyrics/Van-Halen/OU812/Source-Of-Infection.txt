Is everybody ready? Let's go!

(Round and round) Oh, round and round
(Movin' up and down) In 'n out
(Round and round) Yeow!

Crank it! Blow out!
Uh! Ouch!
Help me
Now flip on over
Oh baby, you know that I like it
(Woop! Woop! Woop!)

(Movin' up and down) She choked the chain
(Round and round) She got the hook
(Movin' up and down) Can't get away
(Round and round) Ohhhhh!

Ready, set, go!
