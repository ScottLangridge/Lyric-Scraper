(Words by Van Halen)

Owwwwwwww!

She's so fine
How 'bout a 9 on a 10 scale
With long legs
Straight on up to her lunch pail
Whoo! Sweet little wishbone, oh yeah
Don't wanna break her in half
Lick up one side an' down the other
Always make her laugh, ha! Ha!

She take me down, down, down to the bottom
I got everything you wanted
Give you everything you need
Still you want that sugar daddy
Over me

Huh! She want a sucker (Sucker)
Sucker in a 3 piece
(Sucker) Sucker, all dressed up in a 3 piece suit

I'm on fire, woo!
With just one look
Got me a brand new number
In my little black book
But she don't like the way I dress
She don't like the way I wear my hair
But when I roll you over baby, you don't care

Just take me down, down, down
Down to the bottom
Gimme everything I want
Gimme everything I need
You don't want that sugar daddy
Not over me

Uh! She want a sucker (Sucker)
Woo! Sucker in a 3 piece
(Sucker) Sucker, all dressed up in a 3 piece suit

Oh
Now say it isn't so, baby
You wanna sucker
He just a sucker, he just a sucker
Look at all that money, baby
Ya know, your sugar daddy
You a sugar mamma
Hey, you're both a bunch of suckers!

(Guitar Solo)

Oh, He got a big ol' belly
A stone bald head (Sucker)
Now, listen here, honey
That ain't down your alley, no
He just a sucker (Sucker)
In a 3 piece
Sucker (Sucker) yeah, in a 3 piece suit
S-s-s-sucker
Stone cold sugar daddy
(Oooh ooh ooh) S-s-s-sucker (Sucker)
All dressed up in a 3 piece suit

That's right, go ahead, suck it all up Right down to the last drop
