(Words by Van Halen)

Hey!

Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Till things get out of control, oh!

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Oh! How does it feel when it's love?
It's just somethin' you feel together
When it's love

You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson
Ooh!

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Oh! How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together

(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh oh oh) You can feel it, yeah!
(Oh oh oh oh) Nothin's missin', yeah!

(Guitar Solo)

(Oh oh oh oh) Yeah, you can feel it
(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh oh oh) When nothin's missing, ow!

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Ooh, how does it feel when it' love?
It's just something you feel together, hey!

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love
Ooh, when it's love
Hey! It'll last forever

(Na na na-ah na na)
When it's love
(Na na na-ah na na)
(Na na na-ah na na)
(Na na na-ah na na)
You and I, we're gonna feel this thing together
(Na na na-ah na na) (repeat to end)
When it's love, ooh
When it's love, baby
You can feel it, yeah!
We'll make it last forever
Ooh-ooh, when it's love
