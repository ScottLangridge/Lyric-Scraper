(Words by Van Halen)

We was broke and hungry on a summer day
They sent the sheriff down to try an' drive us away
We were sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty-faced kid in a garbage can, uh ha
Ooh! And I'm alone, I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive

Broken down and dirty, dressed in rags
A-from the day my mama told me "Boy, you pack your bags."
A-send the mayor down in his pickup truck
The jury look at me, say "Outta luck." Oo-ooh, yeah!

And I'm alone, I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive, uh-aah!

(Guitar Solo)

Alright! Uh!

Now, I'm broken down and dirty, dressed in rags
A-from the day my mama told me "Boy, you pack your bags."
An' we were sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty-faced kid in a garbage can
Di-yeah, yeah!

Babe, I'm alone and, I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive, ow-ow!

(Guitar Solo)

Wow! I'm gone! Ooh yeah! Oh!
Ow-ow!

Baby, let me run
Oh-oh, oh-oh!
I'm a spark on the horizon
Ow!

Ow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow!
Ow-wow-wow-wow-wow!
