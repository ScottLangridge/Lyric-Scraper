(Words by Van Halen)

Oh...
Yeah, we're all fast breakers comin' outta the gates
Takin' chances. We're the crash n' burn
Yeah, there is a way with beauty but you never gave a love
Cross the line where none return

Oh, I watch my television, almost lost my mind
It said "Open your eyes. Leave it all behind."

I heard the wind a-whisp'rin'
Strong magic comin' on
They comin' out for sure

Come see your children, yeah
They're lighting up the skies
Won't recognize them anymore (Ha ha)

Wolves at my door, wised up quick
Turned here an' gone, from on the go
Seems the old folks who come up short
Were the pretty little kids who didn't want it, no

I had some crazy vision, one I can't deny it
It said "Open my eyes. Leave it all behind."

I heard the winds a-whisp'rin'
Strong magic comin' on
It's comin' out for sure

Come see your children, yeah
They're lighting up the skies
You won't, recognize them anymore

Ooh, mama, see the firelights
Ooh, we're comin' out tonight
Ooh, mama, see the firelights
Ooh, lightin' up the sky
Light 'em up!

(Guitar Solo)

Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light up the sky
Light 'em up!
