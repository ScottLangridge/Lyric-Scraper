(Words by Van Halen)

My heart, you're breakin' my heart
Girl, you better start thinkin' somethin' real
Seems like lovin' you is just a crazy dream
But do as you feel
All these crazy women
One more crazy night
But one night's all we're given
So baby (Ahh) leave me alone, or baby, stay the night

(Oh, women in love)
Oh baby, make up your mind (Make up your mind)
I know you're in love (Oh, women in love)
So baby, make up your mind (Women in love)

Scream, go on an' scream
That your love is all you're knowin'
But honey, if you're needin' a woman just as bad as me
Ya ought'ta be goin'

All these crazy women
Ah just one more crazy night
But one night's all we're given
So honey (Ahh) leave me alone, or I may be stayin' the night

(Guitar Solo)

All these crazy women
Ah just one more crazy night
But one night's all we're given
So honey (Ahh) leave me alone, or lady, you're stayin' the night

(Oh, women in love)
Mmm baby, make up your mind (Make up your mind)
And I know you're in love (Oh, women in love)
Mmm babe I know you're in love (Women in love)

I know, I know
Ooh yeah! This woman in love. In love. In love, ooh yeah!
Ah ah ah!
Ah ah ah!
Ooh yeah, wow!
Ooh yeah, oh yeah-eah
Aaahhh!
