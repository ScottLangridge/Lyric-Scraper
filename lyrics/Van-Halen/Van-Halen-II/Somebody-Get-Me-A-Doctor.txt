(Words by Van Halen)

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh yeah! Ow-ow!
You better call me a doctor, baby, no pain
Overloaded, down the drain

Somebody get me a doctor

You better call up the ambulance I'm, deep in shock
Overloaded baby, I can hardly walk

Somebody get me a doctor (Ooh!)
Somebody get me a doctor

Yeah! I'm feelin' over fine
And I'm speedin', down that line

Woo, woo!

(Guitar Solo)

Ow! Ow! Ow!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Woo!
Oh, woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

Ow!
Ooo!

Ya better call up a doctor, feelin high
I'm overloaded baby, I say "Bye-bye!"

Somebody get me a doctor. Oh, yeah!
Somebody get me a doctor. Ooh, ooh!
Somebody get me a doctor. Ah, yeah!
Ooh!

Somebody give me a shot!
