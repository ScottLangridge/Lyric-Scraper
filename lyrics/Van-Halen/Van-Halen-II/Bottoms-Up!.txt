(Words by Van Halen)

Ow!
I been sitting here 'bout half the night, ah
Uh, momma fill my cup up
Said, I came here to waste some time
I think I'm gonna jump up

I'm singin', I'm dancin', most every night
I want to do that with you, babe
Let's do this bottle right!

Oh, oh, (Oh!) baby. (Ow!) Bottoms up! Ow!

Woo! Ah pretty maids all in a row
Go on, set 'em up, up
Come um-um-um-um-um baby, bottoms up!

I'm singin', I'm dancin', most every night
An' I wanna do that with you, babe
Let's do this bottle (Oh!) right!

(Guitar Solo)

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Woo! All right. Ow!
Ev'ryone sing a little bit, ah!

Come um-um-um-um-um baby, (hah ha ha) bottoms up
Come um-um-um-um-um baby, bottoms up
Come um-um-um-um-um baby, (Woo) bottoms up, bum-bum-buh
Come um-um-um-um-on baby, bottoms up
Owww!
Yeah
