(Words by Clint Ballard, Jr.)

Hahhhhh
Well I'm, feelin' better, now that we're through
Feelin' better baby, I'm over you

(Ah) I've learned my lesson baby, and it left a scar
(Ah) But now I see how ya really are

You're no good! No good, no good
Baby, you're no good. Oooh yeah
No good, no good, no good (Ah-hah!)
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart, simple n' true
Broke a heart for someone like you

(Ah) We'll be comin' back, don't come running to me
(Ah) I wanna love you, maybe set you free

You're no good, no good, no good
Baby, you're no good. Whoa oh-ooh
You're no good, no good, no good (Ah-no!)
Baby, you're no good
Hah

(Guitar Solo)

Used to be I couldn't sleep at night, baby
Now you go on an' do what you want to

Ow!

(Ah-ow!)
No good, no good, (Ow-ow!) no good
Baby, you're no good (Ow!)
(Ow-ow!)

Ah! Uh! Uh!
