Senorita I'm in trouble again
And I get get free,
(Senorita) You're exactly what the doctor ordered,
Come and talk to me,
(ahhhh)I can't crow before I'm out of the woods,
But there's exceptions to the rule,
(ah-ahhhhh)Senorita do you need a friend? I'm in love with you....

Catch as catch, catch as catch can,
Anybody in their right mind could, see
You and me....
(oooh-oooooh-ohh, oooh-oooooh-oooh)

You say you're lonesome just getting by
But you turn your eyes from me,
Be sure you're hurting long before you fly 'cause you've got me...

Catch as catch, catch as catch can,
Anybody in their right mind could see,
You and me,
Catch as catch, catch as catch can,
When I see you all your little guitars, sing to me.....

I can see you don't know which way to turn, but
The sun still shines,
(Senorita) Don't you know that you can dance with me,
Anytime?
(ahhh)
Can't crow before I'm out of the woods,
But there's exceptions to the rule,
Ah-aaahh)Senorita do you need a friend? I'm in love with you......
(oooh-oooooh-ooh, oooh-oooooh-oooh)
(oooh-oooooh-ooh, oooh-oooooh-oooh)
(oooh-oooooh-ooh, oooh-oooooh-oooh)
