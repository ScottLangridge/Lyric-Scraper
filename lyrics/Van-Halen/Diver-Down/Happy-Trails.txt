(Words by Dale Evans)

Nmmmmmm dip dip Mmmmnnnnmm
Bum-ba-deeda-bum-ba-deeda bum-ba-deeda bum-ba-deeda (continued throughout)

Happy trails to you
Until we meet again
Happy trails to you
Keep smilin' until then

Who (Ooh-ooh) cares about the clouds when we're together
Just (Ahh-ahh-ahh) sing a song and think 'bout sunny weather

(two, three)
Happy trails to you
'Til we meet again
(laughter)
