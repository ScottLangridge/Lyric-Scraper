(Words by Van Halen)

She ain't waiting 'til she gets older
Her feet are makin' tracks in the winter snows
She got a rainbow that touches her shoulder
She be headed where the thunder rolls

Ow, ow, ow, she got that rhythm
Got that rhythm of the road, ah
Ow, ow, ow, she get crazy
Woman get crazy, if she can't go
Aw, but uh, she just lookin' good

She comes like the secret wind
She's as strong as the mountains, walks tall as the trees
She been there before, she'll never give in
She'll be gone tomorrow like the silent breeze, uh

(Ahh) Ow, ow, ow, she got rhythm
(Ahh) Got that rhythm, of her own
(Ahh) Ow, ow, ow, she get crazy
(Ahh) She get crazy if she can't go
But uh, ah she just lookin' good

You know how sometimes, you got to run
You runnin' blind, but you jumped the gun

The question is not, "Does love exist?"
But when she leaves, where she goes?
I got the feelin' she don't know either
Wait like the wind, watch where she blows

(Guitar Solo)

Ow. Oh, oh, got that rhythm
That sweet rhythm of her own
Oh, oh, oh, she get crazy
Woman get crazy if she can't go
Oh, oh. A-lookin' good, aw yes
