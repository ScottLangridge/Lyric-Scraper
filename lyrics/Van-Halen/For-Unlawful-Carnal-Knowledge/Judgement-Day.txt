(Words by Van Halen)

Arr-heah!

It's my life. Get off my ass, get outta my face
Man, I don't see no problem
Kickin' back, ain't kickin' you, no no!
Anyway, if I make 'em, I'll solve 'em

Whoa, oh, ohh. That's right. Yeah yeah-yeah. Woo!

Makin' plan's a waste. Ain't no future here
Got no faith, got no religion

Oh tell me why (ooh-ooh) should I (ooh-ooh)
(Ahh) Care or even, why should I try?
I just slide slide on by (ooh-ooh)
(Ahh) Never bad enough to crucify me

Huah! Put it out until Judgement Day
I'll bear the cross on Judgement Day

I done most anything, keep 'em doin' anything 'cause
Sometimes I just wanna do nothin'
Nothin' lost, so tell me how can I lose? Ha
When I'm startin' off with nothin'

Oh tell me why (ooh-ooh) should I (ooh-ooh)
(Ahh) Care or even wanna try?
I just slide (ooh) slide on by (ooh-ooh)
(Ahh) Never bad enough to crucify me.

Ow! Put it off until Judgement Day
I'll bear that (same old cross) same ol' cross
On Judgement Day. Ow!

Uh! Uh!
Ow! Hey!

(Guitar Solo)

Woo!
Mmm

Hey man, everything's all right. Yeah.
Whow! Ow!

Put it off, until Judgement Day
I'll bear the cross, on, Judgement Day, hey
Put it off, put it off, until Judgement Day
I'll bear the (bear the cross) cross
On, Judgement Day

Ow! Whoa yeah! On Judgement Day
(Put it off) Oh! Whoa yeah! On Judgement Day, hey!
Wow!
