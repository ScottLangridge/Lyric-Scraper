(Words by Van Halen)

Well now, none of this was planned
It all just kinda happened
I got more than I wanted, but how is still a mystery
Obsessed with this feeling, I trusted it. So I followed it
I was tripping and stumbling across a land full of miracles

Ow!
Into a world so far from home
Miles and miles from nowhere
Rooms without doors open for me. Oh, no!
Taking me miles and miles from nowhere

Oh, (miles and miles). Oh, yeah!

Lost, in this pleasure dome
Lost, in my own pleasure dome

Oh man, I ain't got a clue how to get out
Or how to find this place
I want my control back, but I'm afraid I'll lose that feeling. Ow!

Lost in a world so far from home
I'm miles and miles from nowhere
Fallin' inside my own pleasure dome
I'm miles and miles from nowhere

Oh, (miles and miles). Oh, yeah!

Lost in this pleasure dome
Lost inside my pleasure dome

Ahhhhhhhhh!

(Guitar Solo)

Lost in a world. Can't find my way home
Miles and miles from nowhere
Fallin' inside my own pleasure dome
Miles and miles from nowhere
Millions of miles. Oh, no
Miles and miles and miles from nowhere

Miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh!

Lost, in this pleasure dome
Lost, inside my pleasure dome
Yeah

(Guitar Solo)

Lost
Lost
