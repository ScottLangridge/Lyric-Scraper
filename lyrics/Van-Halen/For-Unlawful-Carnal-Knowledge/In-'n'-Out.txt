(Words by Van Halen)

Yeah, I been in debt from conception
I pay for the rest of your life
As long as I remember, bills have looked me in the eye

You can have it now but ya gotta pay for it later. Oh!
Work me out, the payment's cleared
Now you're workin' for the man. Yeah

They gotcha goin' in. They gotcha comin' out
Same amount, woo! In 'n out

Ain't no way 'round the system
Money make this world go round
All the way, they got you down

Stay and add it up or throw yourself out a window. Oh!
Might cost you less to stick around
One more payment. Lay it down, on the ground

Well, they gotcha comin' in, they gotcha goin' out
Same amount, woo! In 'n out
Oh!

Uh uh uhuh yeah
Uh uh uhuh yeah
Uh uh uhuh yeah
Woo, come on!

(Guitar Solo)

Hey, all depends how ya see it
It's a burn, or an opportunity
One thing for certain, ya get nothin' free
Uh!

I never met a man doesn't owe somebody somethin'. No
No way to get free 'n clear
Only deeper year after year
Oh, yeah

When they gotcha comin' in, when they gotcha goin' out
Gotcha comin' in for the same amount, goin' out!
