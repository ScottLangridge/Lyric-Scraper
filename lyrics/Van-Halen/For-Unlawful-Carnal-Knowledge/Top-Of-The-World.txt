(Words by Van Halen)

Hey, baby. Woo!

I know you believe in me
That's all I ever need. Uh-huh
No no, nothin's gonna stop it
Nothin' will discourage me. Oh, no

Hey baby, uh-it's the only way out
Oh, little darlin', now come on
What's it all about?

Standin' on top of the world
For a little while
Standin' on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got

Oh, I know you wanna touch
I got to have a little taste
I just wanna sink my teeth in that
Fine piece o' real estate. Yeah

Hey baby, woo! Make it nice 'n sweet. Ooh!
Oh, little darlin'
Let's take a walk down Easy Street

Standin' on top of the world
For a little while
Standin' on top of the world
Let's give it all we got

(Ooo-ooo-ooo) Baby, got a feelin'
(Ooo-ooo) Oh, I wanna touch it now
(Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo) See the whole wide world turn upside-down

(Guitar Solo)

Hey baby, woo!

Someday, we'll be standin' on top of the world
For a little while
Standin' on top of the world
'Til we got stung
Standin' on top of the world
For a little while
Standin' on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got

(Standin' on top) Hey baby
(Standin' on top) Hey darlin'. Woo!
Standin' on top
Standin' on top
Standin' on top
