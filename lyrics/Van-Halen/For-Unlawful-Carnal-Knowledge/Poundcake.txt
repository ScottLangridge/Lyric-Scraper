(Words by Van Halen)

(Ain't that some shit?)
(Okay, ya ready to go?)
(Yeah)

Oh yeah!
Yeah! She's gotta have soul
Or it won't feel right
Well, just plain, clean, and simple
Wrapped up nice n' tight

And homegrown and down-home, that makes one
Cookin' up that old time, long lost recipe for me. Woo!

It's gettin' hard to find
Guess it ain't hip enough now
You take an average guy, he can't identify, uh
And there's a short supply of her fine, fine stuff

Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on some o' that
Shake it up, bake it up nice, uh!
Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on all that
I so love my baby's poundcake

Homegrown and down-home, yeah that's the one
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe

Lemme get on some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. I want some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. Gimme some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho-ow!

(Guitar Solo)

Ooh, got some real fine pound... Poundcake. Ah

I've been out there
Tried a little bit of everything
But it's all s** without love
I found the real thing is poundcake

Homegrown and down-home, yeah that's the one
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe, yeah. Woo!
She's down-home and down-home. Oh, that's my woman

Gimme some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. Lemme hold that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. Uh!
Uh-ah uh-ho ho

Homegrown and down-home, woo! Come on babe
Gimme some o' that, gimme some o' that
Homegrown, way down-home. Yeah!
Uh-ah uh-ho ho, yeah, gimme some o' that. Woo!
C'mon baby
Homegrown, homegrown, down-home
Uh-ho ho
