(Words by Van Halen)

Uh!

Hey!

Oh yeah!

Ain't no way I'm sittin' home tonight
I'll be out until the mornin' light
A-just-a hangin' 'round in the local parkin' lot

Oh, checkin' out all the girls, see what they got

Yeah they love it, when me an' the boys
Wanna play some love with them human toys
Woq! We wind 'em up n' let 'em go. Whoa! Oh yeah
Whoa yeah!

Woo! Summer nights and my radio
(Ah-ah) Well that's all we need, baby. Don'tcha know?
We celebrate when the gang's all here
(Ah-ah) Ah, hot summer nights, that's my time of the year-ow!

We made it through the cold
And that freezin' snow is gettin' old, hey!
Next year I'll head out for the coast
Say Boys, That might just call for a toast
Now whaddya say?

I got a line, (Ooh-ooh) you got a pole (Ooh-ooh)
I'll meet you down at (Ooh-ooh) the ole fishin' hole
Wow! Them girls are bitin' good tonight
Ow! Uh-Oh! Whoa yeah!

Summer nights and my radio,
