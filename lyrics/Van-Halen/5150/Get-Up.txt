(Words by Van Halen)

Wow!

Feel like throwin' in the towel?
Don't be a fool
They're out to knock you out n' put you down for the count
Hey, watch the left, watch the right
Below the belt

Uh! They'll run run run you round and round
It's plain to see
It's never gonna stop
They'll run you til you d-d-d-drop
There ain't no power 'round
Can't keep a good man down

Ah, there's still some fight in me
That's how it'll always be
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye
Never say die

Ow! Get up and make it work (Make it work)
Get up. Get up and make it work

You say that love has got you down
Well that's bullshit
Yeah, if this love has got you down
Then love can pick you right back up
There ain't no power 'round
Can't keep a good man down

Walkin' down a dead-end street
Yeah, no mercy at your feet
They're holdin' all the cards
Makin' things so hard, 'fore it goes too far. Kick it

Ow! Get up and make it work (Make it work)
Ow! Get up. Get up and make it work

Wow!

Get up and make it work (Make it work)
Ow! Get up. Get up and make it work

Feel like throwin' in the towel?
Don't be a fool
Hey, they're out to knock you out n'
Keep you down for the count
Now, watch the left, watch the right
Below the belt

Yeah, there's still some fight in me
That's how it'll always be
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye
Never say die!

Just, get up and make it work
Uh! Get up (Get up) make it work (Make it work)
Come on get up make it work (Make it work)
Get up!
Ow!
