The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take a chance with new beginnings

Still we try (Oooh)
Win or lose (Oooh)
Take the highs (Oooh)
With the blues (Oooh)

Always one more
You're never satisfied
Never one for all with you
It's only one for me
Oh, why draw the line?
Meet you half the way
And you don't know what that means
Oh, yeah

I feel like a running politician
Oh! Just tryin' to please you all the time
I given you my self with no conditions

Goin' wide (Oooh)
Runnin' long (Oooh)
Feelin' lost (Oooh)
But not for long (Oooh)

Always one more
You're never satisfied
Never one for all with you
It's only one for me
So, why draw the line?
Meet you half the way
When you don't know what that means
Whoa, yeah

(Guitar Solo)

Always one more
You're never satisfied
Never one for all with you
It's only one for me
So, why draw the line?
Meet you half the way
When you don't know what that means

I'll meet you half the way
Whoa yeah!
I'll meet you half the way
Whoa!
I'll meet you half the way
