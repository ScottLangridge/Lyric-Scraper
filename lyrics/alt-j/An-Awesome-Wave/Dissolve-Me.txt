[Verse 1]
Now dissolve me
Two tabs on your tongue
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep
Sleep now, my only one
Broken sweethearts
Ah... who sleep apart
Both still pine for the others side spine
Spoon as sleep starts

[Pre-Chorus]
And pulse to pulse, now shush

[Chorus]
She makes the sound
The sound the sea makes
To calm me down

[Verse 2]
I am see-through
Soap sliver youre so thin
As I begin rubbing lathers up
Your state worsens on my skin
And gold...
Fat less finger to lip
One-two, three-four, hush

[Pre-Chorus]
And pulse to pulse, now shush

[Chorus]
She makes the sound
The sound the sea makes
To calm me down
She makes the sound
The sound the sea makes
Im tired now

[Outro]
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north sea
