[Intro]
(Good morning flood of blood, good morning everyone)

[Chorus]
C... O-double M-O-N

[Verse 1]
A wave, an awesome wave
That rushes skin and widens in flooded veins
Breathe in, exhale
Ive poked a nerve; hell slap me like a whale

[Chorus]
Slaps the C... O-double M-O-N

[Verse 2]
Tide out, tide in
A flood of blood to the heart and the fear slipstreams
Breathe in, exhale
Ive poked a nerve; hell slap me like a whale

[Chorus]
Slaps the C... O-double M-O-N

[Outro]
Flood of blood to the heart
