[Verse 1]
No space
L-shaped
Tetris
Tile seeking
Somewhere
Oh somewhere
To fit in
Alien

[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

[Verse 2]
AK
Twenty
47
Civilian

[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

[Slowdown]

[Verse 3]
Jeremiah
Looking down and you know where youre looking on down
Do you know where you go
Youre headed on the strings
For the
E-x-t-i-n-c-t

Jeremiah
Looking down and you know where youre looking but you go
Do you know where you go
Youre headed on the strings
For the
E-x-t-i-n-c-t

[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
