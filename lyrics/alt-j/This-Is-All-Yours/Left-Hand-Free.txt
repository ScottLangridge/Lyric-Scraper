Hey shady baby I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower you're the chosen one

Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun, oh no

I tackle weeds just so the moon buggers nibble
A right hand grip on his Colt single-action like [?]

Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun, oh no

N-E-O, O-M-G, gee whiz
Girl you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
All my days he disagrees, oh no
(Speak easy)

Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free 

Hey shady baby I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower you're the chosen one

Well your left hand's free
Well my left hand's free (x4)
Oh no
