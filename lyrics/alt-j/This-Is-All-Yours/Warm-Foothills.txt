[Intro:]
Ooooh

[Verse:]
Dry dunes cater for jumping boys
From the nape of her neck he made his descent
They watched men hurl from rock to sea
Like sternum to button, lined lip pinches in between

[Chorus:]
Your foothills
Your warmth

[Verse 2:]
Iris swims quietly beside me
Oh the leaves and larger weeds sway and stretch themselves beneath
Blue dragonflies dart to and fro
I tie my life to your balloon and let it go

[Chorus:]
Your foothills
Your warmth
Ooooh

[Outro:]
