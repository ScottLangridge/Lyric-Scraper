Whoohoo!
Whoohoo!
Whoohoo!
Whoohoo!

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy but nothing is
No

Whoohoo!
When I feel heavy metal
Whoohoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Whoohoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy
All of the time I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Whoohoo!
When I feel heavy metal
Whoohoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Whoohoo!
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time and I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh, yeah
