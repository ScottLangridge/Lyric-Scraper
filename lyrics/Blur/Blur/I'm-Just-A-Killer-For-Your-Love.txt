I heard a man who had no lungs
He took me in and made me lunch
Told me how I'd lost a friend
He smiled at me - that was the end

And I said,
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love

Cut my hair off in the road
I tear my coat off, drop my load
Wipe my hands on the grass
Cos now I know nothing will last

And I said,
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love
I'm just a killer for your love (to end)
