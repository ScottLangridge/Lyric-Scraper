He makes an inner arm block
Then kicks from behind
The lights, they go off
But he can fight blind
Cos he got the touch
And he won't live long
He comes from Hong Kong
Where justice is done

Chinese bombs, millions jump
Chairman's junk, USA
Won't somebody, won't somebody
Sink the place

Got a call to go to Soho
The dragon said go
Let everyone know
That you got the touch
You come from Hong Kong
Where justice is done
Where people are strong
But you won't live long

Chinese bombs, millions jump
Chairman's junk, USA
Bruce Lee come, save the day
Bruce Lee come the Chinese way
