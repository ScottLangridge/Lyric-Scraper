You're taking the fun out of everything.
You're making me run, when I don't want to think.
You're taking the fun out of everything.
When I don't want to think at all.

[Chorus:]
There's No Other Way
There's No Other Way
All that you can do is watch them play.

You're taking the fun out of everything.
You're making it clear, when I don't to think.
You're taking me up, when I don't want to go up anymore.
I just want you to know.

(Chorus 2x)

Ahh, watch you play.
Ahh, watch you play.

[Instrumental]

(Chorus 4x)
