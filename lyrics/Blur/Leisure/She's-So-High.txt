I see her face
Everyday.
I see her face.
It doesn't help me.(2x)

(Chorus)
She's So High.
She's So High.
She's So High.
I want to crawl all over her.

(Repeat chorus)


I Think of her
Everyday.
I think of her
It doesn't help me(2x)


(Repeat Chorus 2x)

(Instrumental Break)


She doesn't help me(3x).


(Repeat Chorus 2x)
