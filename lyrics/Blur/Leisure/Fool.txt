Sorry
But I don't understand
The things you say
They make no sense at all
Funny
But I think that you mean them all
This time

Don't you
I know that you think I'm a fool
But couldn't you try
To forgive a fool
One more time

Sorry
But I'm not really listening
I've got my mind
On something else
And sometimes I wonder if I'm here
If I'm here at all

I know that you want me to go
Don't you
But it's not as easy as it seems
I know that you think I'm not here at all
But I'm just as fed up as you

I know that you want me to leave
I'm amazed at how cold you can be
Well, may my weak and insipid soul grow stronger in your absence
