So the story begins:

City dweller, successful fella
Thought to himself, "Oops, I've got a lot of money" (lot of money)
Caught in a rat race terminally

I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit (to the limit)
Caught in the century's anxiety
Yes it preys on him (preys on him)
He's getting thin (getting thin) {tricycle life}

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
(ooh la la ooh) Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
(ooh la la ooh) Oh, it's like an animal farm, lots of rural charm in the country

He's got morning glory and life's a different story
Everything's going jackanorry (jackanorry)
Touched with his own mortality
He's reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
(close your eyes child)
Oh, it's the century's remedy
For the faint at heart (faint at heart)
A new start (new start) {tricycle life}

(Background repeated during next verse:)
(Blow, blow me out I am so sad I don't know why)
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
(Ooh la la ooh) He's got a fog in his chest, so he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths in the country
(Ooh la la ooh) But you'll come to no harm on the animal farm in the country

In the country (Doo doo doo)
In the country (Doo doo doo)
In the country-y-y!

[A real feel good instrumental solo.]

Blow, blow me out I am so sad I don't know why (x2)

Oh, he lives in a house, a very big house in the country
(ooh la la ooh) Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
(ooh la la ooh) Oh, it's like an animal farm, lots of rural charm in the country

Oh, he lives in a house, a very big house in the country
(Ooh la la ooh) He's got a fog in his chest, so he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh, takes herbal baths in the country
(Ooh la la ooh) Yes you'll come to no harm on the animal farm in the country
Ooh la la la

(Spoken behind instrumental solo: I wanna be, I wanna be {in the country})
