I met him in a crowded room
Where people go to drink away their gloom
He sat me down and so began
The story of a charmless man
Educated the expensive way
He knows his claret from his beaujolais
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray
But then nature didnt make him that way
He went...

Na na na na na na na na naaa (2x)
He thinks hes educated airs
Those family shareswill protect him
That well respect him
He moves in circles of friends
Who just pretend
That they like him
He does the same to them
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

Na na na na na na na na naaa (2x)

He knows the swingers and their cavalry
Says he can get in anywhere for free
I began to go a little cross-eyed
And from this charmless man I just had to hide

Na na na na na na na na naaa (2x)
He talks at speed
He gets nose bleeds
He doesnt see
His days are tumbling
Down upon him
And yet he tries so hard to please
Hes just so keen
For you to listen
But no-ones listening
And when you put it all together
Theres the model of a charmless man

(Do anything you do if you can)

He thinks he's educated airs
Those family shareswill protect him
That you'll respect him
And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keenfor you to listen
But no-one's listenig
And when you put it all togetherthere's the model of a charmless man

Na na na na na na na na naaa (4x)
