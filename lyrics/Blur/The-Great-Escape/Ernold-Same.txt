Ernold same awoke from the same dream
In the same bed
At the same time
Looked in the same mirror
Made the same frown
And felt the same way as he did every day
Then ernold same caught the same train
At the same station
Sat in the same seat
With the same nasty stain
Next to same old what's-his-name
On his way to the same place
With the same name
To do the same thing
Again and again and again
Poor old ernold same
Oh, ernold same
His world stays the same
Today will always be tomorrow
Poor old ernold same
He's getting that feeling once again
Nothing will change tomorrow
