It's over, you don't need to tell me
I hope you're with someone
Who makes you feel save in your sleeping tonight
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
I've got no distance left to run

When you see me, please,
Turn your back and walk away
I don't wanna see you
'cause I know the dreams that you keep
That's where we meet
When you're coming down
Think of me here
I've got no distance left to run

It's over
I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone
Who makes you feel
That this life, is a life
Who settles down,
Stays around,
Spends more time with you,
I've got no distance left to run

I'm coming home
It's over
Come on home
No more
