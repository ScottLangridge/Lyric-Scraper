Gimme good times
Gimme soul life
Give me fever
I'm a believer
Give me anything
Gimme space brain Gimme music, gimme love
I've never seen love

Gimme good times (I wanna be with you,
Let me jump high and all I want is you)
Gimme easy breathing
Give me everything, everything, everything
(wahka, wahka...)

Gimme good times
Oh, gimme soul life
Give me fever
I'm a believer
Give me anything (I wanna be with you,
Gimme space brain and all I want is you)
Don't leave me ever
We'll live forever
(yes we will, I know we will)

Oh, gimme good times
Gimme soul lifes
Gimme fever
I'm a believer
You know I am
Give me anything (I wanna be with you,
And gimme space brain and all I want is you)
Gimme music, give me love
I've never seen love
Stick it in my brain
La, lala, lala, lalala...
