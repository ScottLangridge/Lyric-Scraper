I've got no style, I take my time
All those losers on the piss again
I dose, dose away
That's just the way it is
I've got Trimm Trabb
Like the flashboys have
Now I can't go back
Let it flow, let it flow
I sleep alone, I sleep alone

That's just the way it is
Just the way it is
That's just the way it is
I've got Trimm Trabb
Like the flashboys have
And I can't go back
Let it flow, let it flow
I sleep alone

I've got no style
Just take my time
All those losers on the piss again
I doze, doze away

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
I've got Trimm Trabb
Like the flashboys have
And I can't go back
Let it flow, let it flow
I sleep alone, I sleep alone
I sleep alone, I sleep alone
