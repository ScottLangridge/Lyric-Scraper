I live my stream
I'm a guillotine
Pull it away
In my machine.
Where have I been?
I'm not you.
Shooting stars in my left arm
It's an alcohol low
Giving away time to Casio
The sun is slow
And I've got soul.
Is this where I'm going to
We('ll) see, we see, we see

I kill this sleep
I'm the man in the moon
I'm walking on sand
On my own high noon
In love with the moon
And not you

'cause I live my stream
I'm a guillotine
Pull it away
In my machine.
Forget (forgive) where I've been
I forget you
Is this where I'm going to
We see, we see, we see
