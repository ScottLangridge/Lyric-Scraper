I gotta get over
I gotta get over
I gotta get better
I'm with you forever
I gotta find genius (Caramel)
I gotta get better (Caramel)
I gotta stop smoking (Caramel)
I gotta get better (Caramel, Caramel)
-do doo do do doo-
Where's the magic
I gotta get better
Oh lord give me magic
I'm with you forever
I gotta find my skill (Caramel)
And live by the mountains (Caramel)
I love you forever
I knew I..., I knew I...
(and you are, and you are..
Low, low, low)
