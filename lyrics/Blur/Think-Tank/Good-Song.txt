Waiting, got no time to hide in
The country got a hold of my soul
Tv's dead
And there ain't no war in my head.. Now
And you seem very beautiful to me

Sleeping, but my work's not done
I could be lying on an atom bomb
I take care
Cos I know you'll be there
You seem very beautiful to me

It's the rest of my life
Just rolling and rolling
The picture in my pocket
Looks like you
It's the rest of my life
Just rolling rolling rolling
We're all
