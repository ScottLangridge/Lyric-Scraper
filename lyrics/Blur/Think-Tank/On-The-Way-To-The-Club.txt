And on the way to the club
I fell down a hole
All the people there
Said you come along(? )

And i, I just wanna be, darling' with you
The music's made that way,
My eyes are blue there's nothing I can't do

So I stayed in the club
Just rewarding myself
Happiness, it turned into something else

And I just wanna be, darling, with you
The music's made that way,
My eyes are blue there's nothing I can do
