What am I to do

Someone here is really unhappy

Put myself on the line

It seems that I never got through to you

So I wean myself off slowly



I'm a darkened soul

My street's all pop music and gold

All our lives are on tv

You switch off and try to sleep

People get so lonely



I believe, I believe, I believe

Everything's out to sea

I believe, I believe, I believe

I believe it's the way it should be

I hope you feel the same



Everyone is dying

Stop crying now here comes the sun

I didn't mean to hurt you, oh no no

It takes time to see what you've done

So I wean myself off slowly



I believe, I believe, I believe

Love is the only one

I deceive, I deceive, I deceive

I deceive cos I'm not that strong

I hope you feel the same



And now, now

It seems that

It's falling apart

But I hope I see the good in you

Come back again

I just believed in you
