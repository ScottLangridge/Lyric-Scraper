Where's the love song to set us free
Too many people down, everything turning the wrong way round

And I don't know what love will be
But if we stop dreaming now, lord know we'll never clear the clouds

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time
To open up your mind

And watch the world spinning gently out of time

Feel the sunshine on your face
It's in a computer now
Gone are the future [?] way out in space

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time
Tell me I'm not dreaming
But are we out of time
(we're) out of time (x4)
