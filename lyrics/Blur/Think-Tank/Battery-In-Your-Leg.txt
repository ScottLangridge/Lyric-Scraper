This is a ballad for the good times
So put a battery in your leg
Put a rock beat on the record
And get it stuck there in your head
You can be with me

I've got nothing to rely on
I've broken every bone
Everybody's stopped believing
But you know you're not alone
You can be with me

This is a ballad for the good times
Another dignity we held
Don't get better ...........
And you ain't coming back
You can be with me
If you want to be
You can be with me
