Practice doesn't make perfect, when you're interbreeding.
Speaking drivel can it get confused with heavy breathing?
Mixing drinks at water holes get snarled up in the suburbs.
Meandering through this and that, you're suspected of vagueness.

When work is done, got to Villa Rosie every night.
(We're waiting)
So form a queue, at Villa Rosie every night
(So tasty).

Across the common every day you come across the fine line.
But wearing boots can prevent the leeches in the long grass.
Eating between meals stifles the appetite. Is it healthy?
Coming home that nagging doubt there in your belly.

And all the while, at Villa Rosie every night.
(We're tasting)
A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night
(So tasty).

[Instrumental]

All losers come to Villa Rosie every night.
(We're waiting)
So form a queue, at Villa Rosie every night
(So tasty)
Don't break your back at Villa Rosie every night.
(We're waiting)
A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night
(So tasty)
