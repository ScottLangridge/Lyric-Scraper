The pay-me girl's had enough of the bleeps.
(So) She takes a bus into the country.
Although she's got herself rosey cheeks,
She didn't leave enough, money to pay the rent.
The landlord says that she's out in a week.
What a shame, she was just getting comfy.
Now she's eating chocolate to induce sleep.
In a chemical world, it's very, very, very cheap.

[Chorus:]
And I don't know 'bout you,
But they're putting the holes in.
Yes. Yes.
It's been a hell of a do.
They'll be putting the holes in.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

The peeping thomas has a very nice view.
Across the street at the exhibitionist.
These townies, they never speak to you.
Just stick together, so they never get lonely.
Feeling lead, feeling quite light-headed
Had to sit down and have some sugary tea.
In a chemical world, in a chemical world, it's very, very, very cheap.

[Chorus:]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]
And I don't know 'bout you,
But they're putting the holes in.
Yes. Yes.
It's been a hell of a do.
They'll be putting the holes in.
Yes. Yes.
And that's right out of view.
They'll be putting the holes in.
Yes. Yes.
And I don't know 'bout you,
But they're putting the holes in.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

Until you can see right through.
Until you can see right through.
Until you can see right through.
Until you can see right through.
