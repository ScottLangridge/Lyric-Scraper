Lead in me and me in water, dangling in my world
I swallowed too much oily water, it keeps slipping down my spine

In a sense of self in decline, growing fat on sound
It's only an early morning dream, and the whole world will be alright

[Chorus:]

My head is full of suspicion, I'm coming home sometime
I've swallowed too much oily water, it keeps slipping down my spine

In a sense of self in decline, lying on my back
It's only an early morning dream, and the whole world will be alright

[Chorus:]
