Well, can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside...
But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya
From doing what your supposed to.

Like waking up too early,
Maybe we can sleep in.
I'll make you banana pancakes,
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we can pretend it all the time, yeah
Can't you see that it's just raining
Aint no need to go outside.

But just maybe
Halaka ukulele momma made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
'Cause your my little lady

Lady, lady love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside
And we can pretend it all the time

And can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Mmm, Mmm
Can't you see, can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind

But the telephone is singing, ringing
It's too early, don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough

Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow
Mmm, Mmm
Wake up slow

But you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya
From doing what your supposed to

Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now.

And we can pretend it all the time, yeah
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need.
Rain all day and I really, really, really don't mind.
Can't you see, can't you see?
You gotta wake up slow.
