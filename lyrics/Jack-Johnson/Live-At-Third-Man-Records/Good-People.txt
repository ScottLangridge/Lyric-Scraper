Well you win
It's your show now
So what's it gonna be
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch of
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad getting' worse so

Where'd all the good people go
I've been changin' channels I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testin' one two
Now what you gonna do
Bad news, misused, got too much to lose
Gimme some truth
Now who's side are we on
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray and by the way now

Where'd all the good people go
I've been changin' channels I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sittin' 'round feeling far away, yeah
So far away but I can feel the debris, can you feel it
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all gonna be
You might notice some hesitation
'Cause what's important to you is not important to me, mm mm mm mmmmm
Way down by the edge of your reason
Well it's beginning to show
And all I really wanna know is

Where'd all the good people go
I've been changin' channels I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Where'd all the good
People go/They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testin' one two
Now what you gonna do
Bad news, misused, gimme some truth
You got too much to lose
Whose side are we on today anyway
OK, whatever you say
Wrong or resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
Where'd all the good people going going gone
