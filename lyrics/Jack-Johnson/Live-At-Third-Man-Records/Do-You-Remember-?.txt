Do you remember when we first met
I sure do
It was some time
In early September

Though you were lazy about it
You made me wait around
I was so crazy about you
I didn't mind

So I was late for class
I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find
You painted flowers on it

Guess that I was afraid
That if you rode away
You might not roll back
My direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then
And now the craziest thing of all
Over 10 years have gone by
And your still mine
Locked in time
Let's rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together
The piano took up the living room

You'd play me boogie woogie
I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house
Now you still say we are

We built our get away
Up in a tree we found
We felt so far away
Though we were still in town

Now I remember watching
That old tree burn down
I took a picture that
I don't like to look at

Well all these times
They come and go
And Lord, it don't seem so long
Over 10 years have gone by
We can't rewind
We're locked in time
But your still mine

Do you remember?
