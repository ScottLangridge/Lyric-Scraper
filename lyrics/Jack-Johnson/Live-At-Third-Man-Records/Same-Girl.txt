If you could read my mind
You'd say baby you're right
And I don't wanna fight anymore
You're usually righter than I am
And I'm not a very good fighter
And my, neither are you

So let's be through with this one
Cause some things never change
I know you're still my same girl
Who builds her own frames
For the pictures that she paints
With lots of monoray
Men across the bay
Right back to my same girl
Uhmmm hmmm hmmmm
Uhmmm hmmmm hmmmmm hmm
How can you be so calm when the truth is sometimes
Living in the eye of the storm
With everything going on around us
I feel comfort in the sounds when you say
It will be ok
Like a star that's immune to the light of the day
Told dreams it could follow me
But not with my same girl
How builds her own frames
For the pictures she paints
With lots of monoray
Men across the bay
Right back to my same girl
