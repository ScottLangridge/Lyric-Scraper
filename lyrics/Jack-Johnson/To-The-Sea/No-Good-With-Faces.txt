No Good with faces and I'm bad with names
Gave me directions but it's all the same ah nah I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
Streetlamps are broken black the way I came
Who broke the moonlight watch it wax and wane ah na I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for rain it's our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
It's not only you you're looking at now

Road signs are stolen left here hole in this flame
Who stay my patience who stole my way ah nah I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for raid it's our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
It's not only you you're looking at now

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for raid it's our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
It's not only you you're looking at now

Oooh you're looking at now
Oooh you're looking at now

No Good with faces and I'm bad with names
Gave me directions but it's all the same ah nah I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
