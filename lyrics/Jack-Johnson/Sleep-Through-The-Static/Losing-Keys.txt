Don't worry
Everybody in the room notices you
Sit back and relax
The night is early
We are about to overdo it
So come and tell me something that you've already told me
Cause everybody's heard our lovely stories
I'm hoping some of them are true

I've been losing lots of keys lately,
I don't know what that means
But maybe I've been better off with things that can't be locked at all
I've been feeling kind of sea sick lately,
See you reaching to me come and save me
You or me, I would much rather take the fall

The world has it's ways
To quiet us down
The world has it's ways
To quiet us down comes the rain
Down comes our spirits again
But down comes the strength
To lift us up and then...

Been going up when now
For to long
Forget how
To let go
Seems to hard
To late now
To turn around
The world has it's ways
To quiet us down
The world has it's ways
To quiet us down comes rain
Down goes our spirits again
Down comes the strength
To lift us up and then...
