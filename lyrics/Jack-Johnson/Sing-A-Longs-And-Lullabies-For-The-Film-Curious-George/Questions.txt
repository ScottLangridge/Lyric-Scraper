Questions, I've got some questions
I want to know you
But what if I could ask you only one thing
Only this one time
What would ya tell me
Well maybe you could give me a suggestion
So I can know you
What would ya tell me
Maybe you could tell me what to ask you
Cos then I'd know you
What would ya tell me
Please tell me that there's time
To make this work
For all intents and purposes
And what are your intentions

Well you try
Well you try

Impressions, you've made impressions
They're goin nowhere
They're just gonna wait here
If ya let them
Please don't let them
I want to know you
And if they're gonna haunt me
Please collect them
Please just collect them
And now I'm beggin
I'm beggin you to ask me just one question
One simple question
Cos then you'll know me
Ill tell you that there's time
To make this work
For all intents and purposes
At least for my own
And what is your heart worth
If it's just left all alone
If ya leave it long enough
And watch it turn into stone

Must we all, always
Be untrue
Be untrue
Be untrue
Be untrue
