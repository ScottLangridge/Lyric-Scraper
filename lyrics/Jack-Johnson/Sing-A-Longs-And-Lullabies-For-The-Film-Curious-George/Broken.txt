With everything ahead of us, we left
Everything behind
But nothin that we needed at least
Not at this time and now
The feelin that I'm feelin, well
Is feelin like my life is finally mine
And with nothin to go back to
We just continue to drive

Without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
Said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

I didn't know what I was lookin for so I
Didn't know what I'd find
I didn't know what I was missin I guess
Youd been just a little too kind
And if I find just what I need
Put a little peace in my mind
Maybe you been lookin too
Or maybe you don't even need to try

Without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
Said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

(instrumental interlude)

With everything in the past
Fadin faster and faster until it was gone
Found out I was losin so much more
Than I knew all along

But everything I been workin for
Only worth nickels and dimes
But if I had a minute for every hour that I wasted
Id be rich and kind
Id be doin fine

Without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
Said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

Without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
Said without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
