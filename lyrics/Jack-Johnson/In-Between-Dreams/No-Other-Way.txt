When your mind is a mess
So is mine
I can't sleep
Cause it hurts when I think
My thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make
Chances we take
They're not yours and not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we say
And the words that we mean
Words can fall short
Can't see the unseen
Cause the world is awake
For somebody's sake now, please close your eyes woman
Please get some sleep

And know that if I knew
All of the answers I would
Not hold them from you'd
Know all the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way

Well too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
Cause out the same door that it came
Well it's leaving, it's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we can sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we will find
Our minds will be free to go to sleep

And know that if I knew
All of the answers I would
Not hold them from you'd
Know all the things that I'd know
We told each other, there is no other way
