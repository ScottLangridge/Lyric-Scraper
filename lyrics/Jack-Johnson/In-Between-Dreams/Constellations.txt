The light was leaving
In the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
The voices echoed across the way
Its getting late

It was just another night
With the sun set
And the moon rise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to papas translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
The wind may calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the scene
Stars above are chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough
All else fades
Fades away

It was just another night
With the sun set
And the moon rise not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations
