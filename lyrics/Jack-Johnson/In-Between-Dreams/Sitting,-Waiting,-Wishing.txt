Now I was sitting waiting wishing
That you believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But Lord knows that this world is cruel
No I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool
Learning in loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing your fool?

I sing ya songs I dance a dance
I gave ya friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
And maybe you been through this before
But it's my first time
So please ignore
The next few lines cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting waiting on you
I can't always be playing playing your fool
I keep playing your cards
But it's not my scene
Wont this plot not twist?
I've had enough mystery,
Keep building it up, then shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute
Just sit and wait it
Just wait a minute
Just sit and wait it

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wondered why'd it taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And If I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting waiting on you?
Must I always be playing playing the fool?
No I can't always be waiting waiting on you
I can't always be playing playing your fool, foool
