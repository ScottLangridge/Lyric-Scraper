Its such a tired game
Will it ever stop
How will this all play out
Upside out of my mouth

By now we should know
How to communicate instead of coming to blows
We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how
We're all burning under the same sun
By now we say it's a war for peace
Its the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could close our eyes it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We can try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all
We try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it wont take too long
Cause words are burning same
And who we gunna blame now?

And oh, it's such a crying crying crying shame
Its such a crying crying crying shame
Its such a crying crying crying shame, shame, shame

By now
Its starting to show
A number of people are numbers who aint coming home
I can close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
Close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
Its a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?
Its such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
Is not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out
Upside out of my mouth
And who we gunna blame?
On and on
Its such a crying crying crying shame
Its such a crying crying crying shame
