Based on your smile
I'm betting all of this might be over soon
But you're bound to win
Because if I'm betting against you, I think I'd rather lose

But this is all that I have so please
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
You know I only have so little so please
Mend your broken heart and leave

I know it's not your style
And I can tell by the way that you move it's real real soon
But I'm on your side
And I don't want to be your regret
I'd rather be your cocoon

But this is all that you have so please
Let me take what's left of your heart and I will use
I swear I'll use only what I need
I know you only have so little so please
Let me mend my broken heart and...

You said this was all you had
And it's all I need
But blah, blah, blah
Because it fell apart and

I guess it's all you knew
And all I had
But now we have
Only confused hearts and
I guess all we have
Is really all we need

So please
Let's take these broken hearts and use
Let's use only what we really need
You know we only have so little so please
Take these broken hearts and leave
