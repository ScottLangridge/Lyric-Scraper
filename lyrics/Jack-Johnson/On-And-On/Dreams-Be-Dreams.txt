Shes just waiting for the summertime
When the weathers fine
And she could hitch a ride out of town
And so far away
From that low down, good for nothing
Mistake making fool with excuses like
Baby that was a long time ago
But that's just a euphemism
If you want the truth he was out of control
But a short time is a long time
When your mind just wont let it go

Well summer came along and then it was gone
And so was she but not from him
Because he followed her just to let her know
Her dreams are dreams
All this living is so much harder that it seems
But girl don't let your dreams be dreams
You know this living is not so hard as it seems
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Dreams be dreams
Dreams
