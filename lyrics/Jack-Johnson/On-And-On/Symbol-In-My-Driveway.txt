I've got a symbol in my driveway
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
I've got you a brand new weapon
Let's see how destructive we can be

Got a brand new set of stencils
I've been connecting all the dots
Got my plans in a zip-lock bag
Let's see how unproductive we can be

I've got a light bulb full of anger
And I can switch it on and off
Situations that can be so bright
I can't believe
How pathetic we can be

I've got a perfect set of blueprints
I'm gonna build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth?

I've got a phosphorescent secret
But don't you tell nobody else
Next thing you know
The whole world will be talking
About all the clues they got
They just ain't no use because

I had a mosquito on my nose
Why does a guitar have strings?
