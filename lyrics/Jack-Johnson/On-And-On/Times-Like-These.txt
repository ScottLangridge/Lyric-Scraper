In times like these
In times like those
What will be will be
And so it goes
And it always goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mmm

And there's always been laughin', cryin', birth and dyin'
Boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
And heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
But then her

But times
Times like these
In times like those
What will be will be
And so it goes
But there will always be...

Stop and go and fast and slow action reaction
Sticks and stones and broken bones
Those for peace and those for war
And God bless those ones not these ones but those ones

Make times like these
And times like those
What will be will be
And so it goes
And it always goes
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes

Somehow I know, it wont be the same
Somehow I know, never be the same
