[Hook:]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl and uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

[Verse:]
Anyway
A new york nine's an everywhere-else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleepin' with this girl that he met up on west end
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in trojans
Most people don't fuckin' hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at pianos
And cross-fadin' off of nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in bk
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a dj
Like, she listenin' to old freeway
Cause everybody listens to biggie, but she different
Right, that's why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
And can I have this dance?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
We could pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started datin' after art school
Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time
Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design
Everytime we see each other I'm takin' you home
Our relationship has gotten sylvester stalone
Yellow 9/11 persian girl in the back car
But me writin' a verse the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love rugrats
Watchin' lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of jameson
Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on ludlow
She still look good though
Love is eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass, not a 10 but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show, I was super great
Hotel penthouse, go on and let it roominate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept goin'

[Hook x2]

[Break]
Ooh girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry, cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say
I'mma piece of shit
Believe in this
I'm tellin' you
Cause we barely knew, what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh

[Hook x2]
