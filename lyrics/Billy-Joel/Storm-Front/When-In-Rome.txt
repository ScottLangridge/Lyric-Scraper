Well I see you in the morning
Putting on your pretty clothes
And I watch you do your makeup
Like they do in all  those fashion shows
Then you trun to me so that I can see
If you put yourself together right
Then you go away and you're gone all day
But I know you're coming home tonight
And when you're home, darling all you've got to be is you
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Well it's alright if you're tired when your day is done
You can see when you look at me, you're not the only one
It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl
But you can't let them see you cry
It's a fact of life, now man and wife
Work full time to just get by
And when we're home all it's gonna be is me and you
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

I've done some strange thngs I never thought I'd do before
But if the strain brings happiness, more or less...
More or less...

Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing,
Because I've learned the rules
And when tims are tough, I've got just enough
If you're standing right by my side
Darling more and more I get hungry for
All the ways you keep me satisfied
On our own there ain't nothing we can't get thru
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools
I don't mind the gmes I'm playing,
Because I've learned the rules
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone
Al we've got to be is me and you
On our own there ain't noghint that we can't get thru
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Swing that hammer and break that stone
Push those buttons and answer that phone
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night
Everybody's working up a big appetite
Do as the Romans do...
