Of all the people in the world that I know
You're the best place to go
When I cry, when I cry

I never asked for much before, not before
Things are changed; I need more
Tell me why, Judy, why?

I never thought that she would say
Say goodbye; but she did
And now I wanna die.  I wanna die

I never thought that I would need, need a friend
But I did, in the end
Tell me why, Judy, why

Oh, what a scene
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way
Oh, where you been?
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day

A man my age is very young, so I'm told
Why do I feel so old?
Tell me why, Judy, why?

Oh, what a scene
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way
Oh, where you been?
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day

There's no tomorrow 'cause my dreams did not last
So I live in the past
Tell me why, Judy, why?
