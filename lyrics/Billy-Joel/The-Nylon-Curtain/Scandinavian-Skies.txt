The sins of Amsterdam were still a recent surprise
And we were flying over Scandinavian Skies
We climbed towards the sun, we turned and cursed as one
We pulled the shades and closed our eyes, eyes

The Stockholm city lights were slowly starting to rise
And we were strapped against those Scandinavian skies
The landing gear came down and touched the Swedish ground
And we were all so paralyzed, -----ized, -----yzed

On the plane we were mainly sound and lights
In the veins, we could play the blues all night

The tour of Germany was bleeding into our eyes
And we were sailing over Scandinavian skies
We had the Midas touch until we met the Dutch
And they exhausted our supplies, -----ies, -----ies

Who's to pay for this international flight?
Who could stay?  We were only there for the night

We watched the power fall inside the Olso hall
While all the cold Norweigians cried, --ied

Who could say, what was left and where was right?
By the way, I could play the blues all night
