Careless talk, that's what you heard about me
Careless talk, talk keep talking
Jealous talk, that's what I heard about you
Jealous talk, talk keep talking
Everybody's telling lies
I don't even know why
Why can't people find something better to do?
Careless talk, I don't believe what they say
Careless talk, don't believe it
I heard them talk
Say you've been putting me down
Let them talk, talk, keep talking
In the shadows on the phone
They won't leave us alone
They've been talking ever since you came around

Careless talk, telling you I'm doing wrong
Careless talk, talk keep talking
Jealous talk, follows wherever you go
Jealous talk, talk keep talking
I'm aware of what you heard
Every terrible word
Everybody's making believe that they know all of the intimate things
That we ever might have said in the heat of a passionate moment
In a conversation shared for the ears of nobody else
There are some things they'll never hear
There are secrets I'll never tell

Careless talk is going around on the streets
Careless talk, talk keep talking
Jealous talk, I know how bad it can be
Jealous talk, talk keep talking
Let them stand where they fall
They don't know us at all
All that talking won't make a difference to me

Careless talk, that's what they say about me
Careless talk, talk keep talking
Careless talk, that's what they say about you
Careless talk, talk, talk keep talking
Careless talk, that's what they say about me
Careless talk, talk keep talking
Careless talk, that's what they say about you
Careless talk, talk, talk keep talking
Careless talk, that's what you heard about me
