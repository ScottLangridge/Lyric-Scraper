Uptown girl, she's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a back street guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl (Uptown girl)
She's been living in her white bread world (White bread world)
As long as anyone with hot blood can (Hot blood can)
And now she's looking for a downtown man (Downtown man)
That's what I am
And when she knows what she wants from her time (wants from her time)
And when she wakes up (She wakes up) and makes up her mind
She'll see (She'll see) I'm not so tough, just because I'm in love with an uptown girl (Uptown girl)
You know I've seen her in her uptown world (Uptown world)
She's getting tired of her high class toys (High class toys)
And all her presents from her uptown boys (Uptown boys)
She's got a choice

Uptown girl, you know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in, she'll understand what kind of guy I've been (I've been)
And then I'll win
And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
She'll say (She'll say) I'm not so tough, (She won't) just because I'm in love with an uptown girl
She's been living in her white trade world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Uptown girl (Going uptown), she's my uptown girl (She's an uptown girl, going up)
Don't You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (Going uptown)
My uptown girl (She's an uptown girl, going up)
Don't You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (Going uptown)
My uptown girl (She's an uptown girl, going up)
Don't You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (Going uptown)
My uptown girl (She's an uptown girl, going up)
Don't You know I'm in love with an uptown girl (Going uptown)
