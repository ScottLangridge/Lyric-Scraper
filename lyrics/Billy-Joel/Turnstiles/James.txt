James... We were always friends,
From our childhood days
And we made our plans,
And we had to go our seperate ways.
I went on the road-
You pursued an education.

James... Do you like your life,
Can you find release,
And will you ever change-
Will you ever write your masterpiece.
Are you still in school-
Living up to expectations... James...

You were so relied upon, everybody knows how hard you tried-
Hey... Just look at what a job you've done,
Carrying the weight of family pride.
James... You've been well behaved,
You've been working so hard
But will you always stay-
Someone else's dream of who you are.
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody... James.

I went on the road-
You pursued an education... James...
How you gonna know for sure-everything was so well organized.
Hey... Now everything is so secure,
And everybody else is satisfied.

James... Do you like your life,
Can you find release
And will you ever change,
When will you write your masterpiece.
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody... James...
