What's the ugliest
Part of your body?
What's the ugliest
Part of your body?
Some say your nose
Some say your toes
(I think it's your mind)
But I think it's your mind
(Your mind)
I think it's your mind, woo woo

All your children are poor
Unfortunate victims of
Systems beyond their control
A plague upon your ignorance & the gray
Despair of your ugly life

Where did Annie go
When she went to town?
Who are all those creeps
That she brings around?

All your children are poor
Unfortunate victims of lies you believe
A plague upon your ignorance that keeps
The young from the truth they deserve. ..
