I'm gonna tell you the way it is
And I'm not gonna be kind or easy
Your whole attitude stinks, I say
And the life you lead is completely empty

You paint your head
Your mind is dead
You don't even know what I just said

That's you: american womanhood!

You're phony on top
You're phony underneath
You lay in bed & grit your teeth

Madge, I want your body!
Harry, get back!
Madge, it's not merely physical!
Harry, you're A beast!

Don't come in me, in me
Don't come in me, in me
Don't come in me, in me
Don't come in me, in me

Madge, I. .. Madge. .. I couldn't help it. ..
I. .. Doggone it!
