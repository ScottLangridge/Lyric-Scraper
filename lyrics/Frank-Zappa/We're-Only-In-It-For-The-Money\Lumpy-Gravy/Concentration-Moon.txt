Concentration Moon
Over the camp in the valley
Concentration Moon
Wish I was back in the alley
With all of my friends,
Still running free:
Hair growing out
Every hole in me
American way
How did it start?
Thousands of creeps
Killed in the park
American way
Try and explain
Scab of a nation
Driven insane
Don't cry
Gotta go bye bye
Suddenly: die die
Cop kill A creep! Pow pow pow

Gary Kellgren: Tomorrow I get to do another Frank Zappa creation. .. And the day after that. .. And the day after that. .. Also at the same time I get to work with The Velvet Underground which is as shitty a group as Frank Zappa's group

Jcb: Hi, boys & girls, I'm Jimmy Carl Black, and I'm the Indian of the group

Concentration Moon
Over the camp in the valley
Concentration Moon
Wish I was back in the alley
With all of my friends,
Still running free:
Hair growing out
Every hole in me
American way
Threatened by us
Drag a few creeps
Away in a bus
American way
Prisoner: lock
Smash every creep
In the face with A rock

Don't cry
Gotta go bye bye
Suddenly: die die
Cop kill A creep! Pow pow pow
