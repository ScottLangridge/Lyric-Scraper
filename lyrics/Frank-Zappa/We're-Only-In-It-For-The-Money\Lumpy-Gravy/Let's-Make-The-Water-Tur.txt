[includes a fragment from Ronnie Sings?]

Now believe me when I tell you that my song is really true
I want everyone to listen and believe
It's about some little people from a long time ago
And all the things the neighbors didn't know
Early in the morning Daddy Dinky went to work
Selling lamps & chairs to San Ber'dino squares
And I still remember Mama with her apron & her pad
Feeding all the boys at Ed's Cafe!

Whizzing & pasting & pooting through the day. ..
(Ronnie helping Kenny helping burn his poots away!)
And all the while on a shelf in the shed:
Kenny's little creatures on display!

Ronnie saves his numies on a window in his room
(A marvel to be seen: dysentery green)
While Kenny & his buddies had a game out in the back:
Let's make the water turn black

We see them after school in a world of their own
(To some it might seem creepy what they do. ..)
The neighbors on the right sat & watched them every night
(I bet you'd do the same if they was you)

Whizzing & pasting & pooting through the day. ..
(Ronnie helping Kenny helping burn his poots away!)
And all the while on a shelf in the shed:
Kenny's little creatures on display!

Ronnie's in the Army now & Kenny's taking pills
Oh! How they yearn to see a bomber burn!
Color flashing, thunder crashing, dynamite machine!
(Wait till the fire turns green. .. Wait till the fire turns green)
Wait till the fire turns green!

This would be a little bit of vocal teen-age heaven, right here on Earth!
