There will come a time when everybody
Who is lonely will be free. ..
To sing & dance & love
There will come a time when every evil
That we know will be an evil. ..
That we can rise above

Who cares if hair is long or short
Or sprayed or partly grayed. ..
We know that hair ain't where it's at

(there will come a time when you won't even be ashamed if you are fat!)

Wah wah-Wah wah

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (a-a-ah!)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (oo-wee-ooh!)

Diddle-diddle-dee
(Diddle-diddle-dee)
Diddle-diddle-dee
(Diddle-diddle-dee)
Diddle-diddle-dee
(Diddle-diddle-dee)
Diddle-diddle-dee
(Diddle-diddle-dee)

La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
Wah wah-Wah wah

There will come a time when everybody
Who is lonely will be free. ..
To sing & dance & love (dance and love)

There will come a time when every evil
That we know will be an evil. ..
That we can rise above (rise above)

Who cares if you're so poor you can't afford
To buy a pair of Mod A Go-Go stretch-elastic pants. ..
There will come A time when you can even
Take your clothes off when you dance
