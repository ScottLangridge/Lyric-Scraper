[includes second part of What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body?]

You're a lonely little girl
But your Mommy & your Daddy don't care
You're a lonely little girl

The things they say
Just hurt your heart
It's too late now
For them to start
To understand
The way you feel
The world for them
Is too unreal
So you're lonely, lonely, lonely,
Lonely little girl
You're lonely. ..

All your children are poor
Unfortunate victims of
Systems beyond their control

Where did Annie go
When she went to town?
Who are all those creeps
That she brings around?

A plague upon your ignorance & the gray
Despair of your ugly life
All your children are poor
Unfortunate victims of lies. ..

Where did Annie go
When she went. ..
