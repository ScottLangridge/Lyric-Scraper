Harry-As-A-Boy:
(singing)

I got a girl with a little rubber head
Rinse her out every night just before I go to bed
She never talk back like a lady might do
An' she looks like she loves it every time I get through
And her name is
A-are-T-I
F-I-C, I cry
A-L, don't be shy!
Artificial rhonda
With the plastic pie

Her eyes is all shut in a ecstasy face
I can cram it down her throat, people, any old place!
Then I throw the little switch on her battery pack
'n I can poot it, I can shoot it till it makes her gack!
And her name is
A-are-T-I
F-I-C, I cry
A-L, don't be shy!
Artificial rhonda
With the plastic pie

Ensemble:

She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
She gonna take what he got 'til nothin' be lef'
