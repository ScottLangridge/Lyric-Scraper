Do you know what you are?
You are what you is
You is what you am, a cow don't make ham
You ain't what you're not, so see what you got
You are what you is and that's all it is
A foolish young man from a middle class fam'ly
Started singin' the blues, 'cause he thought it was manly
Now he talks like the Kingfish ("Saffiiiee!") from Amos 'n Andy ("Holy mack'l dere, holy mack'l dere")
He tells you that Chitlins (Chitlins), well, they taste just like candy
He thinks that he's got the whole thing down
From the Nivea Lotion to The Royal Crown
Do you know what you are?
You are what you is
You is what you am, a cow don't make ham
You ain't what you're not, so see what you got
You are what you is and that's all it is
A foolish young man of the Negro Persuasion
(Well, well, well) Devoted his life to become a Caucasian
(Well, well, well) He stopped eating pork, he stopped eating greens
(Well, well, well) He traded his dashiki ("Uhuru!") for some Jordache Jeans
(Well, well, well) He learned to play golf and he got a good score
(Well, well, well) Now he says to himself, "I ain't no nigger no more" (Hey, hey, hey)
(I want everybody together***) I don't understand you
(***) Bwana ma-coo-bah
(***) Would you please speak more clearly
Mercedes Benz
Who is who (I don't know) and what is what (Somethin' I just don't know)
And why is this (Tell me now) appropriot (That's a funny pronunciation if 'n ever I heard one)
If you don't like (Where'd you get that word?), what you has got (Appropriot? The word is not)
Drop it in the dirt (Drop it yeah) and let it rot (I can smell it now)
Someone else (Here they come, here they come) will surely come (I told you he was comin')
And pick it up (That's right) 'cause he wants some (And he wants it for free)
And when one day (There will come a day) you wonder who (I wonder too) you used to was (Who I was anyway)
And what you do (I, I, I used to work at the post office)
You'll scratch your head (But I don't wanna un-do my doo) and look around (To see what's goin' on)
But what you lost (Can't seem to find it) will not be found (A Mercedes Benz)
Do you know what you are? (I know)
You are what you is (I'm the kinda guy)
You is what you am (That ought to be drivin'), a cow don't make a ham (A four-fifty slc)
You ain't what your not (A big ol' red one) so see what you got (With some golf clubs stickin' out de trunk)
You are what you is (I'm gwine down to the links on Saturday mornin') and that's all it is (Gimme a five dollar bill)
You are what you is (And an overcoat too) and that's all it is (Walk my way fast yeah)
You are what you is (Robbie, take me to Creek Town)
And that's all it is (I'm harder than yer husband; harder than yer husband)
You are what you is (I'm goin down to White Street, to the Mudd Club y'all)
And that's all it is (I'm goin' down to work the wall and work the floor)
You are what you is (And work the pipes and work the wall some more)
And that's all it is
