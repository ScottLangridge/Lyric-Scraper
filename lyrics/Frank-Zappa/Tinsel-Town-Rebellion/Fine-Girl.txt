With a lovely smile
With a bucket on her head
Fulla water from de well
She could run a mile

Oh yeah
She wouldn't spill a drop
It'd stay on top
Her head was kinda flat
But her hair covered that

She was a fine girl
Didn't need no school
She was built like a mule
With a thong sandal
Well, wasn't no kinda job she could not handle
She could get down... Wit de get down
All de way down

We need some more like dat, in this kinda town
