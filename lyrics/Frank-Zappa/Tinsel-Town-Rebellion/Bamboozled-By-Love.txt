Bamboozled by love,
Oh lord, the shit done hit the fan
Bamboozled by love
Oh lord, the shit done hit the fan
The way that girl been carryin' on
I swear I just don't understand
Don't you know I treat her nice and kind
The way no other lover can
Now don't you know I treat her nice and kind
The way no other lover can
I came home the other day and she was
Suckin1 off some other man

I ain't the type for beggin'
I ain't the type to plead
If she don't change those evil ways
I'm gonna make her bleed
She can scream and she can holler
Bang her head all along the wall
If she don't give me what I want
She ain't gonna have no head at all

Bamboozled by love
I said she fooled around too long
Bamboozled by love
I said she fooled around too long
Now I am mad and gettin' meaner
I am here and she is gone
And the reason you have not seen her
She is underneath the lawn
I said she's underneath the lawn, lawn, lawn

Now look I ain't the type for beggin'
I ain't the type to plead
If she don't change those evil ways
I'm gonna make her bleed
She can scream and she can holler
Bang her head all along the wall
If she don't give me what I want
She gonna have no head at all

Bamboozled by love
I said she fooled around too long
Bamboozled by love, oh lord
I said she fooled too long
Now I am mad and gettin' meaner, meaner
I am here and she is gone
And the reason you have not seen her, seen her
Is she is underneath the lawn
