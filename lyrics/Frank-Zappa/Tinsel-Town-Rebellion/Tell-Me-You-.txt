Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Like I want you to
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Girl... Girl... Girl...
I love you so hard now, I'm cryin' for you
Don't make me lose my pride
I want to come inside
And grab ahold of you, thank you
Grab ahold of you
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Like I want you to
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Girl... Girl... Girl...
I want to feel it, give me your love now
Don't make me steal it, don't make me steal it
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Like I want you to
Tell me you love me, tell me you love me
Girl. .. Girl... Girl...
I love you so hard now,
I'm cryin' for you
Burnin'with fire,
I gotta hot desire
'Cause I gotta make love with you
'Cause I gotta make love with you
I gotta make love with you
'Cause I gotta make love with you
Tell me you love me, like I want you to
Tell me you love me, like I want you to
Tell me you love me, like I want you to
