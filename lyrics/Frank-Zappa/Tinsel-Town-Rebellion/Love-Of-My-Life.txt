Love of my life, love of my life

Love of my life, I love you so
Love of my life, don't ever go
I love you only
Love, love of my life

Stars in the sky
They never lie
Tell me you need me
Don't say good-bye
I love you only
Love, love of my life

Stars in the sky
They never lie
Tell me you need me
Don't say good-bye
I love you darling
I love you only
Don't ever leave me
Don't make me lonely

Love of my life
I love you so
Love of my life
Don't ever go
I love you only
Love, love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my life
Love of my...
