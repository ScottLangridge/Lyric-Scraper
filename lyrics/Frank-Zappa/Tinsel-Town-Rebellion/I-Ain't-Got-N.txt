Ain't got no heart
I ain't got no heart to give away
I sit and laugh at fools in love
There ain't no such thing as love
No angels singing up above today
Girl I don't believe
Girl I don't believe in what you say
You say your heart is only mine
I say to you, you must be blind
What makes you think that you're so fine
That I would throw away
The groovy life 1 lead
'Cause baby, what you've got, yeah
It sure ain't what I need
Girl you'd better go
Girl you'd better go away
I think that life with you would1 be
Just not quite the thing for me
-Why hritsotau? See my-way-
Why should I be stuck with you
It's just not what I want to do
Why should an embrace or two
Make me such a part of you
I ain't got no heart to give away
Away
No no no no no no no
Ain't got no heart
Ain't got no heart
I ain't got no heart to give away
