Debra Kadabra
Say she's a witch
Gee, that's solid!
Ain't that a bitch?
Debra Kadabra -Haw, that's rich!

Ione, a rancho granny,
Shook her wrinkled fanny

Shoes are too tight and pointed
Ankles sorta puffin' out
Cause me to shout:

Oh Debra Algebra Ebneezra Kadabra
Witch Goddess of Lankershim Boulevard
Cover my entire body with Avon Cologna
And drive me to some relative's house in East L. A.
(Just till my skin clears up)
Turn it to Channel 13
And make me watch the rubber tongue
When it comes out
Of the puffed and flabulent Mexican rubber-goods mask
Next time they show the Biirnaca

Make me buy The Flosser
Make me grow braniac fingers
(But with more hair)
Make me kiss your turquoise jewelry
Emboss me
Rub the hot front part of my head
With rigid unguents
Give me blessed relief!

Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Learn the Pachuco Hop
And let me twirl ya

Oh Debra Fauntleroy Magnesium Kadabra!
Take me with you...
Don't you want any of these?
