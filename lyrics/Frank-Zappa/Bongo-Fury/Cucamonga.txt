Out in Cucamonga
Many years ago
Near a Holy Roller Church
There was once a place
Where me and a couple of friends
Began practicing for the time
We might go (??-??.. .??-?? .. .??-??)
On tv

And as fate would have it
Later on we got a chance to play.
All we ever really knew:
That it was crazy
To be doin' it any other way
