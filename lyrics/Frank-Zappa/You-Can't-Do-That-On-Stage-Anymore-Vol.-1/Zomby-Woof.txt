Three hundred years ago
I thought I might get some sleep
I stretched myself out onna antique bed
An' my spirit did a midnite creep

You know I'll never sleep no more

It seem to me that it just ain't wise

Didja ever wake up in the mornin'
With a zomby woof behind your eyes

Just about as evil as you could be

I am the zomby woof
I'm that creature all the ladies been
Talkin' about

I am the zomby woof
They all seek for shelter when I come chargin' out

Tellin' you all the Zomby troof
Here I'm is, the zomby woof

Tellin' you all the Zomby troof
Here I'm is. ..

Reety-awrighty, he da zomby woof
Reety-awrighty, he da zomby woof

They said aw-reety
An' they was aw-righty
An' I was a Zomby for you, little lady. ..

I got a great big pointed fang
Which is my Zomby Toof
My right foot's bigger than my other one is
Like a reg'lar Zomby Hoof
If I raid your dormitorium
Don't try to remain aloof. ..

I might snatch you up screamin' through the window all nekkid
An' do it to you on the roof, don't mess with the
Zomby woof

I am about as evil as a Boogie Man can be!

Tellin' you all the Zomby Troof
Here I'm is, the zomby woof

Tellin' you all the Zomby Troof
Here I'm is, the zomby woof
