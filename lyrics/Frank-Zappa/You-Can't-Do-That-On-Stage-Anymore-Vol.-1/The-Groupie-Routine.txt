You, you know, you understand?
We still wanna hear your record
You know, we still like to come in your bus
Listen now, on the other side of the record,
Didn't you say that you got off bein' juked
With a baby octopus and spewed upon with cream corn?
And that your hair-lipped queen-o-bassplayin' girlfriend
With the cross ties and the tits on her shirt
Had to have it with a hot seven-up bottle or you went up the
Wall?
Oh! howie...
What's the deal, mama?
Howie, all that's true, howie
And sometimes I even dig it with a jack-in-the-box ring job
But howie, we are not, we are not groupies, howie
I told robert plant that
I told elton john
I told steve stills
Yeah
And he didn't even wanna ball me
I can see that...
Listen, the thing is baby, I want some action, you know
I'm only here for a couple of weeks,
Recording at the record plant
With that naked statue in the bathroom and stuff...
I'm horny as fuck!
Listen to me...
I want a steaming, succulent, juicy, drippy, ever-widening
Kind of a smelly, slimy, many folded,
Sort of in-and-out contracting sphincter
Kind of a hole with a, with a, with a...
Let's see, there's gotta be a way I can put this discreetly
Let's say we hop in the isle over those guys
And the blewin' fuck baby!
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm in this band man...
I told you that many times
No matter what goes on
Listen! it just so happens tonight
I mean, this is unbelievable
Are you a virgo
No...
I mean, it just so happens tonight
Me and my girlfriends, well,
We came here lookin' for a guy from a group
Ah!
But just not any guy from any group
Yeah...
We're lookin' for a guy from a group with a dik
Well, I can show you!
But he's gotta have a dik which is a monster!
(wow!)
That's me!
You peeked!
That's me, you little westward wench nipple-queen!
Take me, I'm yours, you hole.
Fulfil my wildest dreams!
Oh! anything for you my most seductive pop star of a man.
Yeah?
Picture this if you can
Okay, I'll try...
Bead jobs
Knotted nylons
Bamboo canes
Three unreleased recordings of crosby, stills, nash & young
Fighting at the fillmore east.
Oh!
Two unreleased recordings of...of the grateful dead,
Sitting in with mel torme
Yeah!
No! i...
Oh! man! oh, I, I just...
I can't stand it!
Do you understand me baby?
I mean, I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!
