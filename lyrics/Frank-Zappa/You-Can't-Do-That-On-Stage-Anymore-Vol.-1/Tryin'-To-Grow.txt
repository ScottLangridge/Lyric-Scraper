Hey, I'm only fourteen
Sickly 'n' thin
Tried all of my life just to grow me a chin
It popped out once, yeah but, my dad pushed it in
Tell me, why did he hurt me?
No, he's my next of kin
He's a Mexican

I'm lonely 'n' green, too small for my shirt
If Simmons was here, I could feature my hurt
Scared of the future
I hope I don't grow
Listen, I know nobody likes me 'cause everywhere that I go they say, "No"
They say, "No"
They say, "No"

"No"
They say, "No"

Now I'm older, got a place in the town babe
Got a chin, about my shoulder and it keeps growing down, and down, and down
I'm horny and lonely and I wish I was dead
Somebody tell me, "Why am I livin'?"
Lord, I wanna be dead instead
That's right, I said, "I wanna be dead instead"
Now dig this
I wanna be dead in bed
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me (Get the picture)
I wanna be dead in bed
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me
I wanna be dead in bed (Lord, I wanna be dead instead)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me
I wanna be dead in bed (I get to shoot up my neighbours, they were tying to kill me)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me
I wanna be dead in bed (Kill me, kill me, kill me)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me (It's all over)
I wanna be dead in bed (Kill me, kill me)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me

One more time for the world
I wanna be dead in bed (I wanna be dead instead, be dead instead)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me
I wanna be dead in bed (I'm a little girl, give me some heather)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me
I wanna be dead in bed (I want liberty, simple to be)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me (Alas, I'll see you)
I wanna be dead in bed (This one's for Marsha, a piece of my heart)
Please kill me 'cause that would thrill me
