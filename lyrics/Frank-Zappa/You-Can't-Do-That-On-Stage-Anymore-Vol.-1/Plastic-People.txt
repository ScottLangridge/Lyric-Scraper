Plastic people
Oh baby, now. ..

(I know it's hard to defend an unpopular policy every once in a while. ..)

Plastic people

You're such a drag

(And there's this guy from the cia and he's creeping around Laurel Canyon. ..)

A fine little girl
She waits for me
She's as plastic
As she can be
She paints her face
With plastic goo
And wrecks her hair
With some shampoo

Plastic people
Oh baby, now
You're such a drag

(I dunno. .. Sometimes I just get tired of ya, honey. .. It's - Ah - your hair spray. .. Or something.)

Plastic people
Oh baby!
You're such a drag

(I hear the sound of marching feet. .. Down Sunset Blvd. To Crescent Heights, and there, at Pandora's Box, we are confronted with. .. A vast quantity of plastic people.)

And walk around
Watch the nazis
Run your town
Then go home
And check yourself

'Bout someone else. .. But you're

Plastic people!
(Woooooooooooooooooooh!)
Oh baby, now. ..
You're such a drag

Ooo-Ooo-Ooo Ooo-Ooo-Ooo Ooo-Ooo-Ooo Ooooooooh!

Moon above
I searched for years
I found no love
I'm sure that love
Will never be
