Hiya folks!
Alright, here's the deal,
This is our last show here in london
Gee, it's gonna be tough!
Got a few...a few of the boys are sick tonight
But they're still gonna...give you their all
I want to introduce you to the members of the rockin' teen-age
Combo and tell you which ones are sick and what they've got
Denny walley on slide and vocals
He has, he has an aluminum finger
And we're gonna have that removed
A little bit later in this show^lthis is ike willis
Ike has a...now ike, ike is our lead vocalist,
Our dynamic male vocalist
He's got a soar throat
And all sorts of other things are wrong with him
He'll never be able to get through this show
The only thing he's got to take care of is his knitted hat
And of course tommy mars,
Who also has stomach-flu, on keyboards
Do you have any other diseases tommy?
No? he's available! ok!
Ed mann on percussion
Ed is still healthy
Except, and he told me this backstage,
Except for his mental health
You have to expect these things in this kind of a group
And peter wolf on keyboards
There's, there...apparently there's nothing wrong with peter yet
(he's got stomach-flu too)
You have stomach-flu too?
Ooh, my goodness!
The circle is closing in
Okay, vince colaiuta on drums
Now, as you can see from looking at vince,
There's absolutely nothing wrong with him
(malnutrition)
Arthur barrow, our bass player has got a ...
He's having a lotta trouble
He's been very sick all day
Missed the soundcheck and everything
But he's gonna try
He's gonna try really hard
And of course: sophia warren on guitar
