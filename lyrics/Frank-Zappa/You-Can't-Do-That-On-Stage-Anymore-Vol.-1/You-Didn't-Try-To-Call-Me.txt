You didn't try to call me
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
No matter who I take home
I keep on callin' your name
And you . . .
I need you so bad
You're The One, babe

Tell me, tell me
Who's lovin' ya now
'Cause it worries my mind,
And I can't sleep at all
I stayed home on Friday
Just to wait for your call
And you didn't try to call me

Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
No matter who I take home
I keep on callin' your name
And you . . .
I need you so bad
You're The One, babe

Tell me, tell me
Who's lovin' ya now
'Cause it worries my mind,
And I can't sleep at all
I stayed home on Friday
Just to wait for your call

I can't say what's right or what's wrong
But I love you
All ya gotta do is call me, babe
'Cause I want you

You make me feel
So excited, girl
I got so hung up on you
From the moment that we met,
That no matter how I try,
I can't keep the tears
From running down my face,
I'm all alone at my place

You didn't try to call me
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
(Baby . . . )
Why didn't ya try, didn't ya try
(I say, please!)
Didn't ya know I was lonely?
I stayed home all afternoon, man
I was working on my car
I fixed the upholstery
I fixed the seat so it would tilt back
We were going to go to the drive-in
And you didn't call me, man
I waited, it was Friday night, I remember, man
It was nine o'clock and I was sitting on home
I was still watching television and you didn't try to call me
We'd been going steady for six weeks
And . . . I thought you were my teen-age thrill
I thought you were my teen angel, man
But you didn't call me
I dig you so much, man, why didn't you call me
If you could have seen me in the afternoon
I was hung up, I even washed the car
I, I reprimered the right front fender, man
We were gonna go, we were gonna go out
And get some root beer afterwards, man
(Baby!)
And I was gonna show everybody my new carburettor
(Baby!)
And you didn't try to call me
(Girl!)
