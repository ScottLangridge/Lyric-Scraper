Be in my video,
Darling, every night
I will rent a cage for you
And mi j-i-nits dressed in white (teeny-little-tiny-little...)

Twirl around in a lap dissolve
Pretend to sing the words
I'll rent a gleaming limousine
Release a Hock of
Ber-herna-herna-herna
Herna-her-nerds

Wear a leather collar
And a dagger in your ear
I will make you smell the glove
And try to look sincere, then we'll

Dance the blues
Let's dance the blues
Let's dance the blues
Under the megawatt moonlight

Pretend to be Chinese,
(One-hung-low)
I'll make you wear red shoes
There's a cheesy atom bomb explosion
All the big groups use

Atomic light will shine
Through an old Venetian blind
Making patterns on your face,
Then it cuts to outer space

With its billions & billions &
Billions & billions and

Be in my video,
Darling, every night
Everyone in cable-land
Will say you're 'outa-site'
You can show your legs
While you're getting in the car, then
I will look repulsive
While I mangle my guitar

Reen-toon-teen-toon-teen-toon
Tee-nu-nee-nu-nee,
Moo-ahhhh

Reen-toon-teen-toon-teen-toon
Tee-nu-nee-nu-nee,
Moo-ahhhh

Reen-toon-teen-toon-teen-toon
Tee-nu-nee-nu-nee,
Moo-ahhhh

Tee-nu-nee- - - -moo-ahhhh
Tee-nu-nee- - - -moo-wah-wah-wah-ooo

After all the close-up shots
Of you in bondage leather
They'll spray an alley with a hose
And we'll escape together, while we

Dance de blude agin
Led dance de blude agin
Led dance de blude agin
In de middle o' de alley

Let's dance your face
Let's dance your lips
Let's dance your nose
And then we'll dance your sinus

Moo-Ahhhh!
