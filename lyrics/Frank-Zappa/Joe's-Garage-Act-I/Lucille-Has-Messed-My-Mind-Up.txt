SCENE EIGHT
LUCILLE HAS MESSED MY MIND UP

JOE is so disoriented by his disease, he goes in the
other room and plays the title cut from an old
Jeff Simmons album, and sings along with it.


JOE:
Lucille

Lucille

Lucille

Lucille

But I still need her
You know I need her

She treats me like my heart
Is made of stone
She runs around
And leaves me home
All alone

She messed up my mind
I'm cryin' alia the time

Lucille
Has messed my mind
up etc., etc., etc.
