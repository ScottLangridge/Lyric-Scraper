After a few weeks on the bus, being porked by toad-os road crew, and being too exhausted to do their laundry on a regular basis, mary is dumped in miami. With no money (and no other famous rock
Ps due into the area for at least three weeks), she tries to pick up a few bucks by entering the wet t-shirt contest at the brasserie...

Ike:

Et t-shirt time again I know
You want someone to show you some tit! Big ones! Wet ones! Big wet ones!

At this point, father riley (who had been recently de-frocked for not meeting his quota, and has grown his hair out and bought a groovy sport coat and moved to miami and changed his name to budd
Es) steps onto the crowded bandstand in his exciting new role as a wet t-shirt contest emcee...

Buddy jones:
Ah, thanks, ike... Yes, it's wet t-shirt time again here at the brasserie... Home of the tits... Huh huh... And it's the charming mary from canoga park up next in her bid for the semi-finals... H
Ry... Howya doin?

Having been fucked senseless by the boys in the crew, mary does not recognize the former religious personage from her nights in the rectory basement during which she acquired her basic manual sk
.. Confounded by his sport coat, she replies...

Mary:
Hi!

Realizing that she no longer recognizes him... Or even appreciates the patient religious training he had given her in the past, buddy jones, like a true wet t-shirt emcee type person, proceeds to
Various stupid things to waste time, making the contest itself take longer, thereby giving the mongoloids squatting on the dance floor an opportunity to buy more exciting beverages... Liquid prod
That will expand their consciousnesses to the point whereby they might more fully enjoy the ambiance of miami by night...

Buddy jones:
Where ya from?

Mary:
Ah, the bus...

Buddy jones:
Which one?

Mary:
You know... The last tour... You know... Leather

Buddy jones:

E kind of red- blooded american girl wholl do anything...

Mary:

Buddy jones:

Mary:

Buddy jones:

S...

Mary:

Buddy jones:
... As viewed through a thoroughly soaked, stupid looking white sort of male persons conservative kind of middle-of-the-road cotton undergarment! Whoopee! And here comes the water!

Mary:
Eeek!

Buddy jones:
No, you'd squeak more if the water got on you... Sounds like you just got an ice pick in the forehead... And here comes the ice pick in the forehead... A million laughs, mary! Anyway; good golly,
A mess... Shes totally soaked... Yeh, totally committed to the fifty bucks... That's it just step into the spotlight... Let the guys get a good look at ya honey!

Mary:

Buddy jones:

Mary:

Buddy jones:

Mary:

Buddy jones:
Home is where the heart is.

Mary:
On the bus.
