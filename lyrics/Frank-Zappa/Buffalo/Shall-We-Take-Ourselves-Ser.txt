Uhhh, Mike Scheller says his life is a mess Fritz Rau says asparagus Should only be consumed By people with a larger mouth (?) fa fa fa fa Shall we take ourselves seriously? Shall we talk about it all night long? Shall we think we are so evolved? Will we be depressed If were wrong? Shall we take ourselves seriously? Shall we take ourselves elsewhere? Shall we drink while we squat there In the middle of this stupid song? Shall we never go out there? Shall we take us where we don't belong When we notice that the spargel is gone? Shall we weep in the box office dawn Oh go away I'm no good for you Are the tickets all counted? Are the costs all accounted for? Shall we bring up the spargel For discussion at least once more? Shall we take ourselves seriously? Shall we think we are so mature? Shall we be very wrong At the end of this song? If we will ever (?)
