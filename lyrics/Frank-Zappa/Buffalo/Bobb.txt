Hey there, people, I'm bobby brown
They say I'm the cutest boy in town
My car is fast, my teeth is shiney
I tell all the girls they can kiss my heinie
Here I am at a famous school
I'm dressin sharp n I'm
Actin cool
I got a cheerleader here wants to help with my paper
Let her do all the work n maybe later I'll rape her

Oh God I am the american dream
I do not think I'm too extreme
An I'm a handsome sonofabitch
I'm gonna get a good job n be real rich

(get a good
Get a good
Get a good
Get a good job)

Womens liberation
Came creepin across the nation
I tell you people I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of freddie
She made a little speech then,
Aw, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick

Oh God I am the american dream
But now I smell like vaseline
An I'm a miserable sonofabitch
Am I a boy or a lady... I don't know which

(I wonder wonder
Wonder wonder)

So I went out n bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doin radio promo
An none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me n a friend
Sorta drifted along into s&m
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
Long as I gets a little golden shower

Oh God I am the american dream
With a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
An I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin, thank you, fred!
Oh god, oh god, I'm so fantastic!
Thanks to freddie, I'm a sexual spastic
And my name is bobby brown
Watch me now, I'm goin down,
And my name is bobby brown
Watch me now, I'm goin down, etc.
