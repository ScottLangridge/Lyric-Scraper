Stick it out

Joe:
Fick mich, du miserabler hurensohn
Fick mich, du miserabler hurensohn
Streck ihn aus
Streck aus deinen heifien gelockten.
Streck ihn aus
Streck aus deinen' heinen gelockten
Streck ihn aus
Streck aus deinen heiften gelockten schwanz
Ah-ee-ahee-ahhhhh!
Mach es sehr schnell
Rein und raus
Magisches Schwein
Mach es sehr schnell
Rein und raus
Magisches Schwein
Bis es spritzt, spritzt, spritzt Feuer!
Bis es spritzt, spritzt, spritzt Feuer!
Aber beklecker nicht das Sofa, Sofa!
Aber beklecker nicht das Sofa, Sofa!
Aber beklecker nicht das Sofa, Sofa!
Aber beklecker nicht das Sofa, Sofa!

Stunned by joe's command of its native tongue, a gleaming model
Xqj-37 nuclear powered Pan-Sexual Roto-Plooker named sy borg
(previously thought to be the son of the lady who called the Police on cut
Two, side I), spindles over to joe and says..

Sy borg:
Pick me... I'm clean...
I am also programmed for conversational English.

This stuns joe, who stands there speechless for a moment. Smitten by
Joe's animal magnetism, sy continues...

Sy borg:
May I have this dance?
And joe, looking sharp in his housewife costume with the napkin on
His head and the yellow chiffon apron, responds boldly by repeating the
Entreaty originally delivered in Deutsch in its conversational English form,
So that his intentions regarding the Appliance will be made perfectly clear...

Joe:
I've got a better idea...
Fuck me, you ugly son of a bitch
You ugly son of a bitch
Fuck me, you ugly son of a bitch
Stick it out
Stick out yer hot curly weenie
Stick it out
Stick out yer hot curly weenie
Stick it out
Stick out yer hot curly weenie
Weenie... Weenie, weenie, weenie!
Make it go fast
In and out,
Magical Pig
Make it go fast
In and out,
Magical Pig
Till it squirts, squirts, squirts, squirts
Fire
Till it squirts, squirts, squirts, squirts
Fire
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa
Don't get no jizz upon that sofa, sofa

Whereupon, in order to prove to joe that he is no ordinary Appliance,
Sy quotes a few lines of traditional American Love Poetry...

Sy borg:
What s a girl like you
Doing in a place like this?
Do you come here often?
Wail a minute...
I ve got it...
You're an Italian...
What?
You're Jewish?
Lore your nails..
Yon must be a Libra....
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine?
Your place or mine.
See the chrome
Feel the chrome
Touch the chrome
Heal the chrome
See the screaming
Hot black steaming
Iridescent naugahyde python screaming
Steam Roller!

Central scrutinizer:
This is the central scrutinizer. Joe and his date an going back
To the apartment to have a little party...
