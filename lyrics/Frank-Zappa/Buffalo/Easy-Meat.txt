This girl is easy meat
I seen her on the street
See-thru blouse an' a tiny little dress
Her manner indiscreet...
I knew she was

Easy, easy, easy meat
Easy, easy, easy meat
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat

She wanna take me home
Make me sweat and moan
Rub my head and beat me off
With a copy of Ratlin'Stone

Easy, easy, easy meat
Easy, easy, easy meat
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat

I told her I was late
I had another date
I can't get off on the Rollin'Stone,
But the robots think it's great...
I knew she was

Easy, easy, easy meat
Easy, easy, easy meat
Easy, easy,
Easy, easy
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat
Easy

Aw the girl's so easy!
Easy
Saw her tiny titties
Through her see-thru blouse
I just had to take the girl to my house
Easy
Meat
