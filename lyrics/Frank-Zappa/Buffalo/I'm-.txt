Aw, I knew you'd be surprised (Aw, I knew you'd be surprised (Aw, I knew you'd be surprised))
One two three four

Feelin' sorry
Feelin' sad
So many ugly people
I feel bad
I'm so cute
They're so homely
Some of them at home 'n' lonely
Wish they could be very cute like me
They will never get to be
Some folks got it
Some folks don't
Some so ugly they never won't
Everybody, see his hair
See his clothes, I'm sure you care
Terry Ted is really sweet
Watch the way he keep the beat
Sweet as honey
He's a piece of cake from the ginseng root 'n' stuff he take
Vitamin E 'n' all the B's
He's so cool he'll make you freeze (Make you freeze)
Make you freeze (Excuse me please)
Step aside
I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna strut
I'm gonna slide
Hey, ugly folks, go get some cyanide and die, die, die, die, die

Ugly is bad
And bad is wrong
And wrong is sinful
And sin leads to eternal damnation
And hot burnin' fire
Hot burnin' fire
Hot burnin' fire
Hot burnin' fire
Screams of agony
Screams of agony
Screams of agony
Screams of agony
