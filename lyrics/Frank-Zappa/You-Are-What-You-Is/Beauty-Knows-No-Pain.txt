Beauty knows no pain so what you cryin' about girl?
Beauty knows no pain so what you cryin' about girl?
Beauty knows no, beauty knows no, beauty knows no

Even if yer plain you could be tryin' it out girl
Even if yer plain you could be tryin' it out girl
Beauty is no, beauty is no, beauty is no

Beauty is a bikini wax and waitin' for yer nails to dry
Beauty is a coloured pencil, scribbled all around yer eye
Beauty is a pair of shoes that makes you wanna die
Beauty is a, beauty is a, beauty is a lie

But you don't care if it's a lie, 'cause you are such a beautiful guy (Hi girls)
(Your head is north) Your head is north (Your head), (Your feet is south) your feet is south (Your feet)
And you save the rest for (Save the rest) (And you save the rest for) Charlie's mouth (Charlie's mouth)
You save the rest for Charlie's (Your head is north (Your head), your feet is south (Your feet)) mouth
And you save the rest for Charlie's enormous mouth (You save the rest for Charlie's enormous mouth)
Charlie's enormous mouth, Charlie

And it doesn't have that stale aftertaste
