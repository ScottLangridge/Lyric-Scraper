It's a miserable Friday night, I'm so lonely and nobody'll give me a ride to "The Grateful Dead" concert, oh rats
I got to be free, free as the wind, free is the way, I got to be
Maybe I'm lost, maybe I sinned
I got to be totally free (Damn, damn, damn, damn)
Our parents don't love us (Our parents, our parents)
Our teachers they say (Parents, parents)
Things that are boring (Parents, parents)
So we're running away (Parents, parents)
And we will be free (Parents, parents)
And people will see (Parents, parents)
That when we are free (Parents, parents)
That's the way we should be (Parents carry them outta here)
(Parents, parents freeze) Nothing left to do but get out the 'ol glue (Parents, parents, sniff it good now)
(Parents, parents freeze, parents, parents)
I got to be free, free as the wind, free is the way I got to be
Maybe I'm lost, maybe I sinned
I got to be totally free (Damn, damn, damn, damn)
Our parents don't love us (Teachers, teachers)
Our teachers they say (Teaching, teaching)
Things that are boring (Teaching, teaching)
So we're running away (Teaching, teaching)
And we will be free (Teaching, teaching)
And people will see (Teaching, teaching)
That when we are free (Teaching, teaching)
That's the way we should be (Teaching)
(We must be free) The glue, I can't find the glue
(We must be free as the wind) If I was at the concert now, I'd be ripped
(We were free when we were born) I could tighten my headband for an extra rush during Jerry's guitar solo
(We were born free, now we are not free anymore) Then I could go to a midnight show of 200 motels
(We wanna be free) Opal, you hot little bitch
(So we're gonna be free) You can take this pin n' hang it in yer ass
(And we wanna be free) You ain't the devil
(So we're gonna be free) Where's my waitress?
Did you know that free is when you don't have to pay for nothing or do nothing
We want to be free, free as the wind
Free is when you don't have to pay for nothing or do nothing
We want to be free, free as the wind
Free is when you don't have to pay for nothing or do nothing
We want to be free, free as the wind
Free is when you don't have to pay for nothing or do nothing
We wanna, yeah, we wanna, yeah, we wanna, yeah, we wanna be free
We gonna, yeah, we gonna, yeah, we gonna, yeah, we gonna be free
We gotta, yeah, we gotta, yeah, we gotta, yeah, we gotta be free
We gotta, yeah, we gotta, yeah, we gotta, yeah, we gotta be free
We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to be free, got to be free, got to be free
We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to be free, got to be free, got to be free
We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to be free, got to be free, got to be free
We gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to be free, got to be free, got to be free
