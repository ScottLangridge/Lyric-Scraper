I'm a beautiful guy
And you have just walked by
And I have gave you the eye
But you pretend to be shy
But I'm a beautiful guy
(You know what I mean? You know whatI mean?)
So I want to know why, why, why
You make me cry, cry, cry
'Cause you wanna try, try, try
Some stupid game on me
They're drinking lighter
They're full of water
I hear them say: "Let's jog... ''
They're playing tennis
Their butts are tighter
What could be whiter?
Hey?
Your atheletic approach has a lot of appeal
The girl is responding to your little deal
She's modern 'n empty 'n totally vain
But beauty, of course, can feel no pain
