Jumbo, go away, Jumbo, go away, Jumbo, go away
Jumbo leave me alone, get your head off my bone, I wanna go home (I'm hungry)
Jumbo lighten up, Jumbo lighten up, Jumbo lighten up
Jumbo give me a break, lighten up on my snake, that's all I can take (Feed me)
It seems I can't explain, the way I feel about you (Robbie take me to Creek Town)
You just don't understand, you're from Kalamazoo (Now)
You got to realize our little romance deal will not materialize into a thing that you'd call real

(I think I have worms)

Jumbo gotta go, Jumbo gotta go, Jumbo gotta go
Jumbo better get back or your eye will get black when I give you a smack (No Danny, don't hit me)
Jumbo don't you cry, Jumbo don't you cry, Jumbo don't you cry
Jumbo this is good-bye, I ain't gonna lie so wash up your pie
Wash up your pie (There are three things that smell like fish) (Really, what are they?)
Wash up your pie (One of them is fish) (Ooh?)
Wash up your pie (The other two) (Whadda you mean "The other two"?)
Wash up your pie (Are growing on you)
