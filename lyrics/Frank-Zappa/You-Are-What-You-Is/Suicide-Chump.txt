You say there ain't no use in livin'; it's all a waste of time
And you wanna throw your life away, well people that's just fine (Go on do it)
Go ahead on 'n get it over with then, find you a bridge and take a jump
Just make sure you do it right the first time, 'cause nothin's worse than a Suicide Chump
You say there ain't no light a-shinin' through the bushes up ahead
And we're all gonna be so sorry when we find out you are dead (Make sure you're dead now)
Go head on and get it over with then, find you a bridge 'n take a jump
Just make sure you do it right the first time, 'cause nothin's worse than a Suicide Chump
Now maybe you're scared of jumpin' and poison makes you sick
And you want a little attention and you need it pretty quick
Don't wanna mess your face up or we won't know if it's you
Aw, there's just so much to worry about
Now what you gonna do?
Go head on 'n get it over with then, find you a bridge 'n take a jump
Just make sure you do it right the first time, 'cause nothin's worse than a Suicide Chump

Now maybe you're scared of jumpin', and poison makes you sick
And you want a little attention and you need it pretty quick
Don't wanna mess your face up or we won't know if it's you
Aw, there's just so much to worry about
Now what you gonna do?
Go head on 'n get it over with then
Go head on 'n get it over with then
Go head on 'n get it over with then
Go head on 'n get it over with then
Go head on 'n get it over with then
Go head on 'n get it over with then
Go head on 'n get it over with then
You're on the bridge, scared to leap but a girl walks over to take a peep
She says, "Don't do it"
But wouldn't you know, the girl got a head like a buffalo
With a little red hair all over the top and her breath would make the traffic stop
She says "I love you but first, let's eat"
And all you can say as you run down the street is
