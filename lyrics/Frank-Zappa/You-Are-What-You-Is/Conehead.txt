Conehead, she ain't really dumb
She's just a Conehead, 'tater chip crumbs all over her face
Is there any more beer stashed away at her place?
She's just a Conehead, she can't help herself
She's a Conehead kind of a girl
Pitch her a ring, that is the thing that's getting her hot-uh
A hoop or a ring goin' over the top of her Conehead
She is from a small town in France
And she's a Conehead kind of girl, kind of guy
That's what she gives me is-uh Ooh! Conehead
When she's on her knees, the point is so high (High)
I keep sayin' please keep it out of my eye, 'cause she's a Conehead
She's a Conehead kind of girl, kind of guy, kind of a girl thing
Saturday night, you're home alone
The tv lights up as her dad comes home
He's been workin' all day at the drivin' school
In a stupid-lookin' hat that he uses to fool the people of Earth
Who might get back if they knew he was really from Remulak
Where the Conehead, people are from
Where the Conehead, people go to
When the Conehead, people are done
With their Conehead, things that are fun

Connie the Cone is dressed real neat like a teen-age girl from down the street
But mom 'n dad they don't approve
Carbohydrates is all they groove
Connie's eye has a tiny tear but they rinse it away with a case of beer
A bag of chips and fibreglass
Her diet's a riot, I can't keep quiet, I'd love to try it but I think I'll pass
To eat that kind of stuff they pack (Yes they're packing it) you'd have to be from Remulak
Where the Conehead, people are from
Where the Conehead, people go to
When the Conehead, people are done
With the Conehead, things that are fun
Where the Conehead, people are from
Where the Conehead, people go to
When the Conehead, people are done
With the Conehead, things that are fun
Where the Conehead, people are from
Where the Conehead, people go to
When the Conehead, people are done
With the Conehead, things that are fun
Where the Conehead, people are from
Where the Conehead, people go to
When the Conehead, people are done
With the Conehead
