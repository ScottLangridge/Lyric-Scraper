And if these words you do not heed, your pocket book just kinda might recede
When some man comes along and claims a godly need
He will clean you out right through your tweed
That's right, you asked for it, remember there is a big difference between kneeling down and bending over
He's got twenty million dollars in his Heavenly Bank Account
All from those chumps who was born again, oh yeah, oh yeah
He's got seven limousines and a private plane
All for the use of his special friends, oh yeah, oh yeah
He's got thousand-dollar suits and a Wembley Tie
Girls love to stroke it while he's on the phone, oh yeah, oh yeah
At the House of Representatives he's a groovy guy
When he gives thanks he is not alone

He is dealin', he is really dealin', irs can't determine where the hook is
It is easy with the bible to pretend that you're in Show Biz (And the one and the two and the...)
They won't get him, they will never get him for the naughty stuff that he did
It is best in cases like this to pretend that you are stupid

He's got Presidential help all along the way
He says the grace while the lawyers chew, oh yeah, they sure do
And the Governors agree to say: "He's a lovely man"
He makes it easier for them to screw all of you, yes, that's true
'Cause he helps put the fear of god in the common man
Snatchin' up money everywhere he can, oh yeah, oh yeah
He's got twenty million dollars in his Heavenly Bank Account
You ain't got nothin', people
You ain't got nothin', people
You ain't got nothin', people
Thank the man, oh yeah
As we end another broadcast today let me say that "You ain't got nothin' and he's got it all"
And your miserable self is against the wall
The only thing you have not tried, is the sport of chumps, that's suicide
