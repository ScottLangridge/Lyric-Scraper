Hob-noblin', with the goblin'
The Goblin' Girl from the mystery world
Hob-noblin' with the goblin'
She's black and green 'cause it's Halloween
Raggedy black is the way she dress
Little green shoes and her hair's a mess
On Halloween night at de costume ball
She's a Goblin' Girl and she can gobble it all
She's a goblin, a Goblin' Girl
She's a goblin, a Goblin' Girl
I been hobblin' 'cause of the Goblin', Goblin' Girl, Goblin' Girl
Some girls like to dress like a witch
Some girls like to dress like a queen
Best way a girl can dress for me is in a Goblin' suit (They look so cute)
When they're a goblin' there ain't a problin
When they're a goblin' I start a-wobblin'
Pink all over, some is tan
Goblin' Girls from every land
They look good from any which-a-way
Every Halloween you can hear me say, "Goblin' Girl, take it away''
