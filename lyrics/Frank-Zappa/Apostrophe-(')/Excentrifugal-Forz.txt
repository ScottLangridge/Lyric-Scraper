The clouds are really cheap
The way I seen em through the forts
Of which there is a half-a-dozen
On the face of my resorts
You wouldn't think I'd have too many
Since I never cared for sports
But I'm never really lonely
In my excentrifugul forz

There's always corla plankun
Kim and me can play the blues
And then I'll watch him buff that
Tiny ruby that he use
Hell straighten up his turban
And inject a little ooze
Along a one-celled hammond organism
Underneath my shoes

And then I'll call pup tentacle
Ill ask him hows his chin
Ill find out how the future is
Because that's where he's been
His little feet got long and flexible
And suckers fell right in
The time he crossed the line
From later on, the way back when
