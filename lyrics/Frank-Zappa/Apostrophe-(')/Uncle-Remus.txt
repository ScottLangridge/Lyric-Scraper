Whoa, are we moving too slow?
Have you seen us, uncle remus?
We look pretty sharp in these clothes
(yes, we do)
Unless we get sprayed with a hose
It aint bad in the day
If they squirt it your way
Cept in the wintah, when it's froze
And it's hard if it hits, on your nose
(on your nose)

Just keep your nose
To the grindstone they say
Will that redeem us, uncle reemus?
I can't wait til mah fro is full grown
Ill just throw away my doo-rag at home

Ill take a drive to
Beverly hills
Just before dawn
And knock the little jockeys
Off the rich peoples lawn
And before they get up
Ill be gone
(Ill be gone)
Before they get up
Ill be knockin the jockeys off the lawn
(down in the dew)
