She's only seventeen
She's really sort of cute
She's working in the street
She's a teen-age prostitute

She ran away from home
Her mom was destitute
Her daddy doesn't care
She's a teen-age prostitute

"I have got a pimp
He treats me like a dog... "
(All the stuff she's shooting
Keeps her in a fog)
"I would really like to try and get away..."
(But if she gets caught he'll cause her some dismay)

Tiny little pants
Chain around my boot
Shakin' in the dark
I'm a teen-age prostitute
