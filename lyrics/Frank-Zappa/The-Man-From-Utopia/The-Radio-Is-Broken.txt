The cosmos at large
Its so very big
Its so far away
The comets...the craters...the vapors
The solar wind
The residual echoes...the residual echoes
The residual echoes from the giant explosion
Where they said it beginned

The germs from space!
The negative-virus knit-wear
The blobulent suit
That's right! the blobulent suit
Its made of rubbert, it's very ugly
Its got an air hose...
(the guy that has it all has a space wrench!)

The things that were supposed to be green
In the balck and white movies
They get you in the neck when you're not looking
They get you, the get you, they get you, get you, get you
The radio is broken -- it don't work no more
The radio is broken -- it don't work no more
The lovely lisa kranston:
(her father invented the secred fuel (that's right!)
For the rocket)
So she gets to go with a clipboard!
She writes it down when the meters go around
And falls in love in a space warp
Space warp
Space warp

The giant knobs
The porthole where you see the earth for the first time
The corrugated fiberglass interior walls
The parially reclining g-force lawn furniture
The brown hole
The pointed brasseries
The atomic war
The tiny little dresses on the space girls
A love-starved race begging to reproduce
With earthmen
They need to reproduce (with john agar)
They need to reproduce (with morris ankrum)
They need to reproduce (with richard basehart)
They need to reproduce (with jackie coogan)
They need to reproduce (with sonny tufts)
The botchino...the botchino...the botchino

The gigantic spider
The co-pilot always plays the harmonica
The navigator always gets killed by a bad space person
Uh-oh -- the radio is broken
It don't work anymore
The radio is broken
It don't work anymore
The radio is broken
It don't work anymore
Well never get back to the earth no more
Uh-oh!
We have to fall in love on uranus!
The radio is...
That's right -- uh-oh
The radio is broken
The meteor storm
You spilled your coke
Youre stepping on the popcorn
John agar!
Uh-oh...
(dwarf nebula)
