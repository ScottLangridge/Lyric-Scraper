You-you-you-ooo
Look like a dor-are-are-k
You act like a dork
Most of the time, also
You're a dor-are-are-are-k
You are a double-dork butt rash
You are a dork, dork, dork, dor-are-are-are-k!
Nobody wants to...
You are boring...you have nothing to say
You eat cheese -- you eat cheese and other things
You can can wrap up an' take with you
From the table
With luigi & the wise guys at the table
You are a dork
You are a dork, dork, dork, dor-are-are-are-k!
A double-dork butt rash
There's one in every crew -- do you know who you are?
We know, but we won't tell you
We don't want to hurt your feelings
But you're a dor-are-are-are-k!
Might as well admit it
When you're a dork
You're a dork, by the way
You're a dork
A double
A double dork butt rash
A double butt rash dork
Luigi & the wise guys at the table
You look like a dork
Look loke a dork
You act like a dork most of the time
You're a dor-are-are-are-k
Double dork
Double dork
Double dork butt rash
