Baby snakes
Late at night is when they come out
Baby snakes
Sure you know what Im talkin about
Pink n wet
They make the best kinda pet
Baby
Baby
Snakes

Looked around
An there's a couple right near me
Baby snakes
Maybe I think they can probably hear me
Pink n wet
Ill take all I can get
Baby
Baby
Sna-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-kes, yeah

They live in a ho-ho-hole
(tiny hole)
That is usually empty
(usually empty, tiny too)
They live by a code
(dit dit dit dit)
That is usually smpte
Which stands for
Society of motion picture & television engineers
Maybe I think
That is what keeps them in sync
They're wet n they're pink
I think I'll give em a, give em a,
Give em a drink

Baby sna-a-a-a-a-akesss
