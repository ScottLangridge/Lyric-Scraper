It was the blackest night!
There was no moon in sight!
(you know the stars aint shinin
Cause the skys too tight)
I heard the scary wind!
I seen some ugly trees!
There was a werewolf honkin,
Long the side of me!

I'm mean n I'm bad, (yknow I aint no sissy)
Got a big-titty girly by the name of chrissy
Talkin about her n my bike n me...
N this ride up the mountain of mystery, (mystery)

(how re you doin?)

I noticed even the crickets
Acted weird up here
And so I figured I might
Just drink a little beer
I said, gimme summa that what yer suckin on...
But there was no reply
Cause she was gone!

Wheres those titties I like so well,
N my goddam beer!
Is what I started to yell, then I heard this noise
Like a crunchin twig, n up jumped the devil!
(hes about this big!)

He had a red suit on
An a widows peak
An then a pointed tail
N like a sulphur reek,
Yes, it was him awright,
I swear I knowed it was!
He had some human flesh
Stuck underneath his claws
You know, it looked to me
Like it was titty skin!
I said, you son-of-a-bitch!
(cause I was mad at him!)
He just got out his floss
N started cleanin his fang
So I shot him with my shooter,
Said: bang! Bang! Bang!

Then the sucker just laughed n said: put it away!
You know, I ate her all up... Now what you
Gonna say?
You ate my chrissy?
Yeah! Titties n all!
Well what about the beer then?
Now, were the cans this tall?
Even her boots?
Would I lie to you?
Shit, you musta been hungry!
Yeah, this is true.
Don't they pay you good for the
Stuff that you do?
Well, you know, I can't complain when the checks come through...
Well I want my chrissy,
Oh yeah?

Hah!
So you just barf it back up!
Now, devil, do you hear?
Look:
Blow it out your ass, motorcycle man!
I mean, I am the devil, do you understand?
Just what will you give me for your
Titties and beer?
I suppose you noticed this little
Contract here...
Yer goddam right, you son-of-a-whore!
Don't call me that!
That's about the only reason
I learned writin for!
Gimme that paper! Bet yer horns I'll sign!
Because I need a beer, n it's titty-
Squeezin time!
Man, you can't fool me! You aint that bad!
Oh yeah?
Why you shoulda seen some of the souls that I've had!
There was milhous nixon n agnew too!

You know...

Yeah, I know... That's... That's what makes me wonder
But I have... I, I think I have something that
You may be interested in...
What is that?
You can have my soul

Bout a thousand years old
But once you gets it
You can't give it back
You gotta keep it forever
An that's a natural fact!
Ooh wee!

For eight fuckin years!!!

So move right along
Tell me what your interests are, you know...
If were gonna come to some kind of agreement,

Cause I don't know if you're the right type for the...
For the place, you know
Look... Lemme tell you what my problem really is, you see
Ok...
My problem is that I don't belong anywhere
Aha...
You see... I don't even belong where you are, you see
I hope not!
I, I'm a simple person, you know
I have very small desires in life
Titties n beer, you know
No! What?
Titties n beer!
No! No man, you're joking...
Titties n beer, titties n beer, titties n beer...
What? No! No please... No! Not that! Oh no man, no!

Oh no! No! No! Wait...

... Wait, wait, please no!
Hey! Look at this!

No! Don't sign it! Give me time to think!
... Hold on a second, boy, cause... That's
Magic ink!

Then the devil barfed
N out jumped my girl
They heard the titties plop-ploppin
All around the world, she said:

I got three beers n a fist fulla downs,
An I'm gonna get ripped, so fuck
You clowns!

Then she gave us the finger!
(it was rigid n stiff)
That's when the devil, she farted
An she went right over the cliff!
The devil was mad!
(I took off to my pad)
I swear I do declare!
How did she get back there?
I swear I do declare!
How did she get back there?
I swear I do declare!
How did she get back there?
I swear I do declare!
How did she get back there?

Alright!
