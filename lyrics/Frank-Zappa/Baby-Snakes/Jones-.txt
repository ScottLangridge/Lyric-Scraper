My baby's got Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
Well, my baby's got Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
Jones crushin' love
She don't merely fit like a glove
I said, "That little girl's got the Jones
That little girl's got the Jones"

She's tryin' to grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
Well, she's tryin' to grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
Grind up my Jones
She don't ever wanna leave it alone
She can push, she can shove 'til it's just nub
She can push, she can shove 'til it's just nub
It's just nub
It's just nub
Here she comes with the red dress on
Steam shoots out from the sprinklers on the lawn
Eyes be rollin' on the concrete fawn
The wind can't blow 'cause the sky is gone
The wind can't blow 'cause the sky is gone
The wind can't blow 'cause the sky is gone
The wind can't blow 'cause the sky is gone

Jones crusher, Jones crusher
Deadly jaws, better get the gauze
She's a Jones crusher, Jones crusher
Deadly jaws, better get the gauze
She's a...
Hey, look out for them deadly jaws
I'll keep your journal baby

Aw, Jones
