Here we go!

The Surgeon General, Doctor Koop
S'posed to give you all the poop
But when he's with P. M. Are. C.
The poop he's scoopin'
Amazes me

C-Span showed him, all dressed up
In his phoney Doctor God get-up
He looked in the camera and fixed his specs
'n gave a fascinating lecture
'Bout anal s**
Anal s**
Anal s**
Anal s**
Anal s**

He says it is not good for us
We just can't be promiscuous
He's just a doctor - he should know
It's the work of the Devil, so
Girls, don't blow!
Don't blow
Don't blow

Don't blow Jimmy, don't blow Bobby
Get yourself another hobby
(If Jesus practiced medicine
I'm sure he'd do it
Just like him)

Is Doctor Koop a man to trust?
It seems at least that Reagan must
(And Ron's a trusting sort of guy -
He trusts Ed Meese
I wonder why?)
I wonder why
Wonder why

The A. M. A. Has just got caught
For doin' stuff they shouldn't ought
All they do is lie and lie
Where's Doctor Koop?
He's standin' by

Surgeon General? What's the deal?
Is your epidemic real?
Are we leaving something out?
Something we can't talk about?
A little green monkey over there
Kills a million people?
That's not fair!
Did it really go that way?
Did you ask the C. I. A.?
Would they take you serious,
Or have they been
Promiscuous
Have they been Promiscuous
Have they been Promiscuous
Have they been Promiscuous
