Act ii

Scene twelve
Dong work for yuda

Central scrutinizer:
Hello there... This is the central scrutinizer...
Joe was sent to a special prison where they keep all the
Other criminals from the music business... You know...
The ones who get caught... It's a horrible place, painted
All green on the inside, where musicians and former executives
Take turns snorting detergent and plooking each other...

(As the central scrutinizer chuckles to himself for a moment,
Father riley, who became buddy jones, steps into view in his
New identity: father riley 8. Jones, Prison Chaplain, who, in a rather
Heavy-handed piece of imagery, is now entrusted with the job of singing
This song as he assists the captured executives in their quest for new
Meat to plook, and, once having found these victims for the princes of
The industry, trades them little blobs of sanctified lubricant jelly forcigarettes
And candy bars while he holds them down so the execs won't have to work
Too hard when they stick it in.)
... Anyway, while he's in there he meets this guy who used to be
A promo man for a major record company, Bald-Headed John...
King of the Plookers...
