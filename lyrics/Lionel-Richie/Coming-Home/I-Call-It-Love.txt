I Look At You
You Look At Me
(You Can't Tell Me You Ain't Feeling Butterflies)
Its obvious,
There's some Chemistry
(I think I know it wen it feels so right)
Girl I wanted so long to know
Now Your telling me you gotta let it go
(don't Tell Me I have to start all over again)
I Never thought that this day would come
(This is somthing that i've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(and you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)
what's inside of my heart it aint gonna change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it I feel it lets not pretend)

(Chorus)
Baby, I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know
I Want The Truth
'cause They Call It
We Call It
You Call It
I Call It Love

It's so clear for you to see
(don't let anybody tell you what to do)
Why they can't they just let us be happy
(i don't want to find somebody new)
If you know what's really in your heart
Then don't let them tear us apart
('cause you feel it I feel it Lets think this through)

(Chorus)
Baby, I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know
I Want The Truth
'cause They Call It
We Call It
You Call It
I Call It Love

(Break)
We Have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go (we're in love)
And now that we know it's real
We are going to let it show
To the whole world
That I'm yours forever
And you're my girl

(Chorus)
Baby, I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know
I Want The Truth
'cause They Call It
We Call It
You Call It
I Call It Love
(Repeat)

Love
They Call It Love
I Call it
Love
