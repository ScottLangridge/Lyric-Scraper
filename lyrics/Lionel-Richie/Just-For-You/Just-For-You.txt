Intro
1. Strophe
Golden days, life was play, pain was all a world away,
We went to school, we learned the rules,
We trusted all they all had to say.
Then life took a turn, we all had to learn,
And we can't go back again.

1. Refrain
And my heart is breaking just for you, just for you.
And my arms are open just for you, just for you,
Just for you.

2. Strophe
God was God, dreams were dreams, life was all cake and ice cream.
Truth was true, and lies were lies, we thought love would never die.
But the world moved on, my illusion's gone,
And I don't know who to blame.

2. Refrain
And my heart is breaking just for you, just for you.
And my arms are open just for you, just for you,
And these tears I'm crying are for you, just for you,
Just for you.

Bridge:
I'm looking for protection, give me shelter from the storm,
I just hope this light inside me keeps me strong!

3. Refrain
And my heart is breaking just for you, just for you.
And my arms are open just for you, just for you,
And these tears I'm crying are for you, just for you,
Just for you.

Coda
Just for you, oh, my heart is breaking!
And my arms are open,
Oh, these tears I'm crying they're just for you.
Oh, yeah!
