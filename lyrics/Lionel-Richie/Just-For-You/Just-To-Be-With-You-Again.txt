So I still walk on through the night and through the rain
I would give it all just to be with you again

It'a a lonely road for my heart is still in chains
But I live my life just to be with you again

We have walked together where angels go
And we found the place inside us, That only we could know

So I still walk on through the night and through the rain
I would give it all just to be with you again

That's the way life goes like a whisper in the wind
But I'll take that fall, Just to be with you again

Can I find a reason? Can I find a way?
'Cause the words I need to tell ya, Are the word I didn't say

So I still walk on through the night and through the rain
I would give it all just to be with you again

I see you standing in the doorway
With that look that's in your eyes
And the feeling that I feel will never die

So I still walk on through the night and through the rain
I would give it all just to be with you again
That's the way life goes like a whisper in the wind
I would give it all just to be with you again

It'a a lonely road for my heart is still in chains
But I live my life just to be with you again
