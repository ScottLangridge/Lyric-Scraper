You held my hand and then you slipped away
And I may never see your face again
So tell me how to fill this emptiness inside
Without love, what is life?
And anyone who knew us both can see
We always were the better part of me
Never wanted to be this free And all this pain, when does it go away?

Then everytime I turn around And you're nowhere to be found I know

I gotta long long way to go before I can say goodbye to you
Oh, I gotta long long way I know
Before I can say goodbye to all I ever knew, Ohhh to you

From memory there is no hiding place
Turn on the tv and I see you there
In every crowd there's always someone with your face
Everywhere, trying not to care

Then everytime I turn around, Ohh and you're nowhere to be found I know

I gotta long way to go before I can say goodbye ohh to you
Ohh, I gotta long way I know before I can say goodbye To all I ever knew
Ohh

To you I wish you everything And all the best that life can bring
I only hope you think of me sometimes
Oh, and even though I feel the pain
I know that I will love again the time will come and I'll move on

I gotta long way to go, a long long way to go
The only thing I want to you, everthing I needed
I gotta long  way I know
Before I can say goodbye, everything I knew
Turn back
Long way, long long way to go
To you
