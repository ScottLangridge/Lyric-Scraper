Chorus:
Ow, She's a brick house
She's as Mighty mighty a just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,
Ain't holding nothing back.

Ow she's a brick house
Well, we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes.

She knows she got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, yeah yeah.
How can she lose with what she use
36-24-36, what a winning hand!

Chorus:
Ow, She's a brick house
She's as Mighty mighty a just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,
Ain't holding nothing back.

Ow she's a brick house
Yeah she's the one, the only one
Built like a black amazon

The clothes she wears, her s*** ways,
Make an old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure 'nough to knock a strong man to his knees

Chorus:
Ow, She's a brick house
She's as Mighty mighty a just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,
Ain't holding nothing back.

Shake it down, shake it down now (repeat 6x)
Shake it down

Chorus:
Ow, She's a brick house
She's as Mighty mighty a just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,
Ain't holding nothing back.

Shake it down, shake it down now (repeat 6x)
Shake it

Chorus:
Ow, She's a brick house
She's as Mighty mighty a just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,
Ain't holding nothing back.
