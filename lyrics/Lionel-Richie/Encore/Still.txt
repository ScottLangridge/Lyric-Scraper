Still
Recorded by the Commordores
(Lionel Richie)

Verse 1
Lady
Morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

Chorus I
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

Verse 2
Those memories
Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind

Chorus 2
So many dreams that flew away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?
We lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

Interlude

Chorus 3
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love you
Still!
