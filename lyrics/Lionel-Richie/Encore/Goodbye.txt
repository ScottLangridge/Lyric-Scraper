I wanted you for life.
You and me for always.
I never thought there would come a time,
That our story would end.
It's hard to understand,
But I guess I'll have to try.
It's not easy to say good-bye

For all the joy we share
For All that time we had to spare
Now if I had one wish,
I would want forever back again.
To look into your eyes and to hold you when you cry.
It's not easy to say good-bye

I can remember all those great times we had.
There were so many memories,
Some good, some bad.
Yes and thought it all
Those memories will last forever.

Is there peace where you are?
Maybe all I need to know.
If I listen to my heart I'll hear your laughter inside.
And so I got to say, I'm just glad you came my way.
It's not easy to say good-bye

Good-bye
