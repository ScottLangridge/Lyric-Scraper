Thanks for the times
That you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something
I must say out loud

You're once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes your once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

You shared my dreams
My joys my pains
You made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my
Life over again
I spend each and every moment with you

You're once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes you once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you to hold you
To feel you to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

You're once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes you're once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you
