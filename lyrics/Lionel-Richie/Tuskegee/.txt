Sail on down the line, 'bout a
Half a mile or so, and I
Don't really wanna know, a
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice, you see
But time after time, I tried
To hold onto what we got, but
Now you're going
And I don't mind
'Bout the things you're gonna say Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah
Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time
Sail on down the line, ain't it
Funny how the time can go, all my
Friends say the told me so, but it
Doesn't matter
It was plain to see, that a
Small town boy like me, just a
Wasn't your cup of tea, I was
Wishful thinkin'
I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
But you gave me nothin' in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away, yeah, yeah
I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of bein' used
I wanna everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time
Woah, sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good
