I walk the land and released all the weight on my shoulders
And I sailed the seas and watched all of my dreams come true
I flew the sky and seen everything from a bird's view
And I rode the streets and reality brought me back to you

That's when I realized that we gotta be alive
Yeah and party like there's nothing left to give
Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, party like there's nothing left to give
Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, party like there's nothing left to give

Can you imagine going through life so crazy?
So busy, don't have time to be with your baby
Need to go out and enjoy this nightlife to save me
I been feeling oh so good about how things going lately

That's when I realized that we gotta be alive
To party like there's nothing left to give
Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, to party like there's nothing left to give
Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, party like there's nothing left to give

Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, party like there's nothing left to give
Yeah, it's nothing, yeah, there's nothing
Yeah, party like there's nothing left to give

People to the left hey, people to the right hey

Now all my fellas to the left hey, ladies to the right hey

Wanna feel your energy, oh yeah, wanna see you rock with me, oh yeah
