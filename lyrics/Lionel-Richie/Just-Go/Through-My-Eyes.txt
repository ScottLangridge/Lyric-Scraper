Baby we were so in love, only one that I could trust
I would never give that up, there's no one like her
Knew you were my everything, was so glad that you with me
Had to tell my family I found that girl

Then out of nowhere you were gone without a reason why
So I'm here in this place by myself, all you had to do was try

If you could see it through my eyes
It would explain the tears I've cried
Why did you walk out of my life?
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me?

If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know the reason why I tried
So hard to never let love die
I wish that you could see, see it through my eyes

What am I supposed to do? Just go on without you?
Easier said than done, I need some answers
I can't even lift my head thinking 'bout the things she said
Only thing that I have left is my love for her

Then out of nowhere you were gone without a reason why
So I'm here in this place by myself, all you had to do was try

If you could see it through my eyes
It would explain the tears I've cried
Why did you walk out of my life?
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me?

If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know the reason why I tried
So hard to never let love die
I wish that you could see, see it through my eyes

I'm hoping and praying that you will return
All my love is here waiting for you, baby just open the door

If you could see it through my eyes
It would explain the tears I've cried
Why did you walk out of my life?
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me?

If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know the reason why I tried
So hard to never let love die
I wish that you could see, see it through my eyes, my eyes
