Does anybody care for us?
Does anybody need for us?
Will anybody take an offered hand?
Does anybody give for us?
"Man you're so strong" what a thing to say!
But I'm sorry I need you today.

But if I go, then when I'm back.
I will show you what you got.
Maybe wrong, and that's no lie.
We should be together, man you know it.

Won't you pass 'round tolerance today.
Inside your head you're so fucked up.
I see you straight.

So if I go, then when I'm back.
I will show you what you've got.
Maybe wrong, and that's no lie.
We should be together, man you know it.
So take me home, sweet home.
