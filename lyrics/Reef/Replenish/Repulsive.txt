Feeling horny, and just that.
You don't want my love I'll take it back.
Learned a lesson, on my knees.
I don't want your dreaded sympathy.
All I want, all I need. Is some mercy for me please.
Give it up now.
Visions of me that make your face a frown.
You want to change my crooked world around.
What I got, what is in my past.
You're not able to see in just one glance.
Come down. Come on, come on, come on...
She don't want nobody 'round.
She don't want nobody coming home.
And all I ask of you. Is what I'd give for free.
I ask the lord for mercy.
I'm begging on my knees.
If we're to live to together, for what we hope and pray.
Then we must give each other a little love to find our way.
