When I was younger than now I am, I liked swimming, so I swam,
The townside of old Cinnamon Lane, tarmac broken from sun,
Up the grass came, up willow I would climb to the top,
Hang and watch the water drop, from my feet to the river below,
Young strength finally waned, then I followed,
I love that glow and now I know:

Summer's in bloom, Summer's in bloom,
Light her up, let her fill the room,
Speak no lie, Summer's in bloom,
Summer's in bloom, light her up, let her fill the room.

Off to mugdley about the years end, I shout up: "let's have a swim!"
I expect all my friends to say "no", they agree so in we go!
I got a stinging nettle rash for it, but I'm so very happy that I did,
I never ever ask why, I don't care why, I just know that:

Summer's in bloom, Summer's in bloom,
Light her up, let her fill the room,
Speak no lie, Summer's in bloom,
Summer's in bloom, light her up, let her fill the room.

When I was younger than now I am, I liked swimming, so I swam,
The townside of old Cinnamon Lane, tarmac broken from sun, up the grass came.
The winter evening that I came home, found out that my girl had gone!
My father's eye told of a place that he'd been,
Strong women play their own tune.

Summer's in bloom, Summer's in bloom,
Light her up, let her fill the room,
Speak no lie, Summer's in bloom,
Summer's in bloom, light her up, let her fill the room.
