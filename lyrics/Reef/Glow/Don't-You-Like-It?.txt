Well I'm a young man, of no particular persuasion,
I like silence, as much as I like conversation,
Don't be scared of some of the things they're saying,
Because it's a Godsend, but not enough people are praying.

Don't you like it when I'm high?
Well I don't care - oh yeah.

I'm not bothered, about representing your nation,
So please be gentle, and do not forget relaxation,
It's the time! Time for beating the one that you're scared of,
It's the time of year, for being the one that you're thinking of.

Don't you like it when I'm high?
Well I don't care - oh yeah.

Hey! Hey you, come here, come here right now,
Said I'm a young, I'm a young man.

Don't you like it when I'm high?
Well I don't care - oh yeah.

Hey stop whining,
See I'm still smiling,
I don't care oh yeah.
