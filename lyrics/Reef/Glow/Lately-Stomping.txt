Lately, I have not been treated gently by myself.
I have been over used, ripped off and abused,
Stomping in my shoes, well no more!

Think of your family, home is the place to be,
Think of your family once more.

Lately, all my clothes have been so dirty and threadbare.
They have been over used, my heart battered and bruised,
Thankless for my views, well no more.

Think of your family, home is the place to be,
Think of your family once more.

Been around the world, and there is nothing that I wouldn't do,
Just to see the smile upon your face.

Think of your family, home is the place to be,
Think of your family once more.
