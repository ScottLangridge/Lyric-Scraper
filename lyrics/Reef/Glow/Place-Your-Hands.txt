Oh place your hands, on my hope,
Run your fingers through my soul,
And the way that I feel right now,
Oh Lord it may go.

So place your hands, on my hope,
Run your fingers through my soul,
And the way that we feel right now,
Oh Lord it may go.

Put your hands on, put your hands on. (x4)

You know you cannot hide, from what's inside,
You know you cannot hide, from what's inside.
So I ask of you to help me through,
I ask of you this thing to do.

Put your hands on, put your hands on. (x2)

So lay me down, for a while,
Join my body with my mind,
And I cried at the Common One,
For weeks aft' he died.

Put your hands on, put your hands on. (x4)

And the way that we feel right now,
Oh Lord it may go
