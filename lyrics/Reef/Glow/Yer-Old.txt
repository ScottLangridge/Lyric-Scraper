Hide away boys you're no longer in favour,
You're yesterdays news and no longer the flavour,
You're washing my mouth, now you shining my shoes,
Don't need me the paper, to read me the news.
Yer old.

Speak I'll of my boys and I'll take you to pieces,
So come face to face if you think I don't mean it,
You're swanning about like you're nobody's fool,
You've shown me the place but I don't want to go,
Yer old.

So what you gonna do?
I wish you would come and tell me.
So what you gonna do?
You're the problem, now you solve it,
So what you gonna do?
I'm the judge and your opinion,
So what you gonna do?

Hide away boys you're no longer in favour,
You're yesterdays news and no longer the flavour,
Yer old.

Now hear me it was the easiest day of my life,
It was the easiest day of my life
