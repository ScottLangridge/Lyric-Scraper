Hey - I won't grab your energy,
So - won't you do the same for me,
So give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up,
Hey - I won't grab your energy,
Because I'm looking for a higher vibration.

Hey - don't you tell me you can't feel this,
When the rain came down but it was warm,
You could see it in the green.
Because I'm looking for a higher vibration,
So won't you give it to me.
