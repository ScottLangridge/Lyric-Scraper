Look at all the life on the earth,
Look at all the life on the earth,
You got yours and I got mine at birth,
Look at all the life on the earth,

Is that all you thought you were worth?
Is that all you thought you were worth?
Wake up now for you're alive tonight,
Loosen up, you're holding on too tight,

Look at all the murder,
Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at,
Look at all the murder,
Brother we can make it but we won't make it alone.
