Won't you give pictures of you?
We'll go out, lounge by the pool,
After the sun has baked us through,
We'll retreat to the bedroom.

I would have left you babe,
I would have left you babe, if I only could.

When we are where we should be,
There'll be no questions in me,
After all was said before,
You came and grabbed some more.

I would have left you,
I would have left you babe,
I would have left you babe, if I only could.
