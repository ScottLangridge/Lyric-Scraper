For your lady, something sweet,
A lullaby before she sleeps,
And if your lady should awake,
You'll hold he in your arms again, again.

For your children, something sweet,
A lullaby before they sleep,
And if your children should awake,
You'll hold them in your arms again, again.

It soon will be morning,
It soon will be morning again.

For your good self, something sweet,
A lullaby before you sleep,
And if you still should awake,
Then you will see the break of day,
Again, again, again, again.
