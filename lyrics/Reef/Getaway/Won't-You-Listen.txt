We're up and down we're all around
We have a mission in every town
We're walking light
We're side by side
We have a mission to make you listen

Have you got a song got a song
Got it coming on

What did you think that we were like
We're walking through a life
We're walking through a life

We're strolling on we're not alone
We have a reason so won't you listen

We're never going come here again
