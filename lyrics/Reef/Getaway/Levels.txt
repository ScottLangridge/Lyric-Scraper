I went out for a walk with my young one hanging
From my chest as we strolled to the levels
Where the water ran

Cold bright day leads us all
Three young lovers walking on and on
Simple man's pleasure I have today
I see my future that way

You stole into my heart

I find it hard not hard to find
I end up chasing a whole year at a time
I found a new rhythm I brought me near
And made that feeling disappear

You stole into my heart

Bring it on bring it on bring it on
Because it's not that far away
Won't you bring it on for me

I sold it all I've nothing more
See me smiling see me walking tall
So raise your drinks and toast to all
And let love enter one and all

You stole into my heart
