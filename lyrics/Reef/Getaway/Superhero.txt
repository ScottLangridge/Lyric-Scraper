Melody I think you've met your maker
Play another let me be the one
Now your evil plan has come undone
You were only looking for a failure

Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you
Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you
I am surging jumping on the dancefloor

Me and my mine we're launching through the air

We have all been given superpowers
That show up whenever you are near
Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you
Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you

Sing me a song I'll fly away
Sing me a song I'll fly away
Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you
Sing me a song I'll fly away
Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you
Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you

Superhero I'm dancing and I feel like you
