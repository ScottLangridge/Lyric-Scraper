Gonna loosen it up
Gonna take a step back
Gonna straighten it out
Because I'm solid with myself

We don't belong here
There's something wrong here
Pray all together for all that matters

Sound that make you come
You know it's in your corner
Sound that make you call

Can you see who I am
I know me better

Shut up come on
With the order that you bring
You know that you were only
Disappearing 'til
