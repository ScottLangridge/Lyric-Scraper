Ooooh!  On the floor can you feel it?  Yes definitely!
On the floor can you feel it?  I've been in my bed all night!
On the floor do you mean it?  Does it really matter?
On the floor can you feel it?  Oh, I can!

I need a time that's physical
The motions you have it
Do not forget your animal
So let it out.

I've got a feeling and set the record straight
Cause I'm singing to set the record straight
I've got a feeling and set the record straight
Cause I'm singing to set the record straight

On the floor can you feel it?  I've been smiling long.
On the floor can you feel it?  Yeah, I've come a long way from my home.
On the floor do you mean it?  I am sure, I've put my foot in my mouth sometimes.
On the floor can you feel it?   I can feel all night.

I need a time that's physical
The motions you have it.
You are the one that I adore
And you can see I want it.
Some people born to criticise
It's just a song, get on it!
Do not forget I'm anima
So let it out

I got a feeling; just set the record straight
Cause I'm singing; I set the record straight
I got a feeling; to set the record straight
Cause I'm singing; to set the record straight

I'd open your mind
But you'd got to find it.
All I say to you
Is don't criticise
Cause you've got to mind it
All good things to you
I'd open your mind but you've got to mind it
All good things to you.

I've got a feeling
And set the record straight!
Cause I'm singing
I'd set the record straight!
I've got a feeling
And set the record straight!
And I'm singing
I set the record straight!
I set the record straight for you!
