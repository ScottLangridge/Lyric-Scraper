Time - you walk the road and then leave it
Behind and nothing's ever clearer in your
Mind but if you go please bear me in mind

Hold on no matter what you're going
Through just hold on and
Celebrate the things you do
Hold on they can take away from you
So hold on

Where are you going without me

Sailor you've thought about your life
And you're a sailor
Cruising days on winds sent by your saviour
If you could hold a day you'd elevate her

Where are you going without me

How do you think you are
You see a place and you can get there
Closer you crawl each day
Beautiful time keeps tripping away
