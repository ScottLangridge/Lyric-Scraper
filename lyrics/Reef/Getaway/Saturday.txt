I don't want to hear that din
It's started again and I am afraid
I don't want to hear that noise
My dad is a void and speech is a choice
I don't want to prod that sore
You're starting to bore be down to my core
I don't want to hear that thing it's started
Again and I am irate

Saturday saturday all alone
I pray for no one's call
My day my day on my own
I ask for nothing more
I've waited all the week for saturday
When no one's at my door
I waited long and lonely days to find my
Hiding from the world

I don't want to join your throng
You say that you're strong
But I think you're wrong
I don't want to be the same
Why do you disdain
When for this I am

All alone again
