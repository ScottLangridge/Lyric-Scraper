On the water down in New Orleans
My baby's the pearl of the quarter
She's a charmer like you never seen
Singing voulez vous
Where the sailor spend his hard-earned pay
Red beans and rice for a quarter
You can see her almost any day
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous

CHORUS:

And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I say hello
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go

I walked alone down the miracle mile
I met my baby by the shine of the martyr
She stole my heart with her Cajun smile
Singing voulez voulez voulez us
She loved the million dollar words I say
She loved the candy and the flowers that I bought her
She said she loved me and was on her way
Singing voulez voulez voulez vous

CHORUS x 2

And if you hear from my Louise
Won't you tell her I love her so
Please make it clear
When her day is done
She got a place to go
