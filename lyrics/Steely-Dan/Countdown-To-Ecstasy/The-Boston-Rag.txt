Any news was good news
And the feeling was bad at home
I was out of mind and you
Were on the phone
Lonnie was the kingpin
Back in nineteen sixty-five
I was singing this song
When lonnie came alive
Chorus:
Bring back the boston rag
Tell all your buddies
That it ain't no drag
Bring back the boston rag

You were lady bayside
There was nothing that I could do
So I pointed my car down
Seventh avenue
Lonnie swept the playroom
And he swallowed up all he found
It was forty-eight hours til
Lonnie came around

Chorus
