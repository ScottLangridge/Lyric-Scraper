Let me put it this way doll
And I know it's getting late
I can tell from the planes of your face
That you're from out of state
But here in the Willows now here's the deal
Tomorrow's for squares-tonight's for real

Drop me off in Groovetime
Do I hear the Slang of Ages
Show me how it's done

Now did you say you were from the Netherlands
Or was that "Netherworld"?
If you grew up in Amsterdam
Then I'm the Duke of Earl
These tabs look iffy-you say they're good
Let's roll with the homeys-knock on wood

Drop me off in Groovetime
Soothe me with the slang of ages
Show me where I turn

You are part of the Dreaming
The end of my life so far?
Or something halfway in between
You ought to know
Hey-where'd you go?

Damn-she skipped dimensions
Was it something that I said?
Or something I was thinking
When she opened up my head?
Let me make it right baby-never mind how
There's a crazy little place I know called "Be There Now"

Drop me off in Groovetime
Do I hear the Slang of Ages
Show me how it's done
Drop me off in Groovetime
Soothe me with the Slang of Ages
This is where I turn
