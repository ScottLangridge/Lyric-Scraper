It must have been my lucky thursday
Your dad went on that spree
Before the crew could put out the fires
You hopped a bus for nyc
Down in tampa the future looked desperate and dark
Now you're the wonderwaif of gramercy park

Chorus:
Who makes the morning fabulous
Who says today's a fun day
Why do I feel like sailing again
Honey it's you - janie runaway

Let's grab some takeout from dean and deluca
A hearty gulping wine
You be the showgirl and I'll be sinatra
Way back in '59
Sweetness in heels - look at you - in long black gloves
Come to old blue eyes tell me - who do you love

Chorus:
Who makes the traffic interesting
Rescues a dreary sunday
Who makes me feel like painting again
Honey it's you - janie runaway

Let's plan a weekend alone together
Drive out to binky's place
The sugar shack in pennsylvania
Or would that be a federal case?
We'll take the big red - the blazer - it's nice inside
And guess who's coming along for the ride

Chorus:
Who has a friend named melanie
Who's not afraid to try new things
Who gets to spend her birthday in spain
Possibly you - janie runaway
