Daddy don't live in that new york city
No more
He don't celebrate sunday on a saturday night
No more
Daddy don't need no lock and key
For the piece he stowed
Out on avenue d
Daddy don't live in that new york city
No more
Daddy don't drive in that eldorado
No more
He don't travel on down to the neighborhood
Liquor store
Lucy still loves her coke and rum
But she sits alone
'cause her daddy can't come
Daddy don't drive in that eldorado
No more

Driving like a fool out to hackensack
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack
He says I gotta see a joker
And I'll be right back

Daddy don't live in that new york city
No more
He can't get tight every night
Pass out on the barroom floor
Daddy can't get no fine cigar
But we know you're smoking
Wherever you are
Daddy don't live in that new york city
No more
