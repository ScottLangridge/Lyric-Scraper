Babs and clean willie were in love they said
So in love the preacher's face turned red
Soon everybody knew the thing was dead
He shouts, she bites, they wrangle through the night
She go crazy
Got to make a getaway
Papa say
Chorus:
Oh - no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh - congratulations
This is your haitian divorce

She takes the taxi to the good hotel
Bon march as far as she can tell
She drinks the zombie from the cocoa shell
She feels alright, she get it on tonight
Mister driver
Take me where the music play
Papa say

Chorus

At the grotto
In the greasy chair
Sits the charlie with the lotion and the kinky hair
When she smiled, she said it all
The band was hot so
They danced the famous merengue
Now we dolly back
Now we fade to black

Tearful reunion in the usa
Day by day those memories fade away
Some babies grow in a peculiar way
It changed, it grew, and everybody knew
Semi-mojo
Who's this kinky so-and-so?
Papa go

Chorus
