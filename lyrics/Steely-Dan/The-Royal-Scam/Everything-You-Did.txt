Outside the stadium
Special delivery
For hoops mccann
Brut and charisma
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good
He's a crowd pleasing man
One on one
He's schoolyard superman
Crashing the backboard
He's jungle jim again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car
We're a star
It's a glamour profession
The L. A. Concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take it's toll

Illegal fun
Under the sun

All aboard
The carib cannibal
Off to barbados
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel
With his eurasian bride
On the town
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers
Is friday's theme
I drove the chrysler
Watched from the darkness while they danced
I'm the one

It's a glamour profession
The L. A. Concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take it's toll

Illegal fun
Under the sun

Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
That's my claim to fame

Jive miguel
He's in from bogota
Meet me at midnight
At mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
After the deal has been done
I'm the one

It's a glamour profession
The L. A. Concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take it's toll

Illegal fun
Under the sun
