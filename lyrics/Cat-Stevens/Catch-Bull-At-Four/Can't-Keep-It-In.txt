Oh I can't keep it in,
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, world's got to see,
See all the love love that's in me.
I said, why walk alone,
Why worry when it's warm over here.
You've got so much to say, say what you mean,
Mean what you're thinking, and think anything.
Oh why, why must you waste you're life away,
You've got to live for today, then let it go
Oh, lover, I want to spend this time with you,
There's nothing I wouldn't do, If you let me know.
And I can't keep it in,
I can't hide it and I can't lock it away.
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood,
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love, oh.
No, I can't keep it in,
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've gotta show the world, world's got to know,
Know of the love, love that lies low, so
Why can't you say,
If you know, then why can't you say.
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light,
Light needs to shine, I said shine light, shine light.
Love, That's no way to live your life,
You allow too much to go by, and that won't do.
No, lover. I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while I'm with you.
'n I can't keep it in,
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, world's got to see,
See all the love love that's in me.
I said, why walk alone,
Why worry when it's warm over here.
You've got so much to say, say what you mean,
Mean what you're thinking, and think anything. Why not?
Now why why why not?
