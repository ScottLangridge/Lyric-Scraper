Hunc ornatum mundi
Nolo perdere
Video flagrare
Omnia res
Audio clamare
Homines
Nunc extinguitur
Mundi et astrorum lumen
Nunc concipitur
Mali hominis crimen
Tristitate et lacrimis
Gravis est dolor
De terraque maribus
Magnus est clamor
O caritas, O caritas
Nobis semper sit amor
Nos perituri mortem salutamus
Sola resurgit vita
Ah, this world is burning fast
Oh, this world will never last
I don't want to lose it here in my time
Give me time forever here in my time.

Translation of Latin:
(I don't want to lose the harmony of the universe
I see all things... Burning, I hear men... Shouting.
Now is the light of the world and the stars going out
Now does the blame for the disaster fall upon men.
Grief is heavy with sadness and tears
Great is the noise from the earth and the seas
O love, O love be with us always.
We who are about to die salute death. Life alone goes on.)
