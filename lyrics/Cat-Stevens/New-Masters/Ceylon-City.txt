I'm going home to the town where I was born
Where little children laughed as they sang
A happy song
In the little town of Ceylon,
Ceylon city, Ceylon city

I've got a boat , I hope it's still afloat
With rusty sails, and an old wooden oar
It goes along, in the little town of Ceylon

Ceylon City.....

My daddy will be waiting there
My sister will be combing down her silver hair
My mamma will be waiting there
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere

Ceylon City....
