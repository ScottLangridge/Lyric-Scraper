Oh very young what will you leave us this time. You're only dancing on this earth for a short while. And though your dreams may toss and turn you now. They will vanish away like your Daddy's best jeans, demin blue, fading up to the sky. And though you want them to last forever you know we never will, you know we never will. And the patches make the good bye harder still.

Oh very young what will you leave us is time. There'll never be a better chance to change your mind. And if you want this world to see better days. Will you carry the words I will love will you? Will you ride the great white bird into heaven. And though you want to last forever you know you never will, you know you never will. And the good bye makes the journey harder still.

Oh, I carry the word of love with? Oh, ride the great white bird.

Oh very young what will you leave us is time. You're only dancing on this earth for a short while.

Oh very young what will leave us is time.....
