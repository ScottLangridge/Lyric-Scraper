Jesus

They used to call him Jesus
Long time ago
Heyre still calling him Jesus
Dont you know
They crossed the wood and hanged him
A long time ago
They still misunderstand him
Those who dont know
And in theevening his love will lead the blind
In every secret corner there in your mind

They called him Gautama Buddha
Oh long time ago
He turned the world to order
Dont you know
He used to sit knowingOh long time ago
Where you and me were going
And in the evening his love will lead the blind
