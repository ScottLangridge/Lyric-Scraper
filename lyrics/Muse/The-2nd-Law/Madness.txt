I... I can't get this memories out of my mind.
And some kind of Madness,
Has started to evolve,
(Mu-mu-mu-mad-mad-mad) x2

And I... I tried so hard to let you go.
But some kind of Madness,
Is swallowing me whole, yeah.
(Mu-mu-mu-mad-mad-mad) x2

I have finally seen the light.
And I... Have finally realized.
What you mean... Ooohooh
And now, I need to know is this real love.
Or is it just Madness,
Keeping us afloat,
(Mu-mu-mu-mad-mad-mad) x2

And when I look back,
At all the crazy fights we have,
Like some kind of M-m-madness,
Was taking control, yeah.
(Mu-mu-mu-mad-mad-mad) x2

And now I have finally seen the light,
And I... Have finally realized,
What you need, mmm

(Mu-mu-mu-mad-mad-mad) x2

And now I have finally seen the end,
(I have seen the end)
And I'm... I'm expecting you to care,
(Expecting you to care)
And I... Have finally seen the light,
(Have finally seen the light)
And I... Have finally realized,
(Realized)

(I need to love) x2

Come to me,
Just in a dream,
Come on and rescue me.
Yes, I know, I can't be wrong
Baby, you're too head-strong.
Our love is...

(Mu-mu-mu-mad-mad-mad) x4
