You won't get much closer
Till you sacrifice it all (all)
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall (wall wall)
Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within (in in)
Do just what you want to
And now stand up and begin

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And it's chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station

Doubts will try to break you
Unleash your heart and soul (soul)
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control-(trol!)
Stand up and deliver
Your wildest fantasy-(sy-sy)
Do what the fuck you want to
There's no one to appease

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And it's chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station

Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And it's chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
Well, I know that soon we'll fight for recognition.
Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And I know that the system hasn't teached us.
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at Panic Station!
