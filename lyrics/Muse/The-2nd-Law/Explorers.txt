Once I hoped
To seek the new and unknown.
This planet's overrun,
There's nothing left for you or for me.

Don't give in, we can
Walk trough the fields
And feeling nature's glow
But all the land is owned.
There's none left for you or for me.
Who will win?
'Cause I concede.

Free me
Free me
Free me from this world.
I don't belong here,
It was a mistake imprisoning my soul.
Can you free me,
Free me from this world.

A world lush and blue
With rivers running wild,
They'll be re-routed south,
With none left for you or for me.
Don't give in,
Hear the engines roar
And save our crops from drought.
But when the black gold's in doubt,
There'll be none left for you or for me.
Fuse helium-3, our last hope.

Free me
Free me
Free me from this world.
We don't belong here,
It was a mistake imprisoning our souls.
Can you free me,
Free me from this world.

Free me
I'll free you
Free us from this world.
We don't belong here,
It was a mistake imprisoning our souls.
Can you free me,
Free me from this world.

Running around in circles feeling caged
By endless rules.
Can you free me, free me from this world.
Go to sleep.
