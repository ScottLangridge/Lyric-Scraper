Take me for a ride, break me up and steal what's left inside
And make them pray, the iniquity has died inside and left a scar
I'm all red and done
Bring me peace and wash away my dirt
Spin me round and have me to divert
And walk into the light

Warm my heart to remind
And hold my head up high
And help me to survive
Kick me when I'm down
Feed me poison, for me till I drown
Wake me up before I get &#7767; unched out and fall into the night

Warm my heart to full [?]
And hold my head up high
And help me to survive
