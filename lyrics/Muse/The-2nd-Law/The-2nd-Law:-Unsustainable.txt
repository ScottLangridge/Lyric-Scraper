All natural and technological
Processes proceed in such
A way that the availability of the
Remaining energy decreases

In all energy exchanges, if no energy
Enters or leaves an isolated system
The entropy of that system increases

Energy continuously flows from being
Concentrated to becoming dispersed
Spread out, wasted and useless

New energy cannot be
Created and high-grade
Energy is being destroyed

An economy based on endless
Growth is unsustainable

Unsu...
Unsustainable

The fundamental laws of
Thermodynamics will place fixed
Limits on technological innovation
And human advancement

In an isolated system, the entropy
Can only increase
A species set on endless
Growth is unsustainable

Unsu...
Unsustainable
