When darkness falls
And surrounds you
When you fall down
When you're scared, and you're lost
Be brave
I'm, coming to hold you now
When all your strength has gone
And you feel wrong
Like your life has slipped away

Follow me, you can follow me
And I, I will not desert you now
When your fire has died out
No ones there, they have left you for dead

Follow me, you can follow me
I will keep you safe
Follow me, you can follow
I will protect you.

Ooo, I wont let them, harm, harm you
Ooo, when, when your heart is breaking

You can follow me, you can follow me
I will always keep you safe
Follow me, you can trust in me
I will always protect you, love
