I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneaths no big surprise
Now it's time, for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

And my plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
Whoa
And my plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
I'm tired of living
Oohhh

Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna loose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

And my plug in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving
Whoa
And my plug in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
I'm tired of giving

And I've seen your loving
And mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
Oohhh yeah
