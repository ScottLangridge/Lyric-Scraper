Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
For bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen too much
Too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth?
You can't come down to earth
You're swelling up
You're unstoppable
Cos you've seen
Seen too much
And too young
Young
Soulless is everywhere
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break a silence
Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you

Yeah link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like it's a birth squeeze
And the love for what you hide
And the bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen too much
Too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break a silence
Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
Oooohhhhaaaaaahhhhh
