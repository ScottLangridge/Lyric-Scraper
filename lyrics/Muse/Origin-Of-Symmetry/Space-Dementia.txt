Height is the one for me
It gives me all I need
And helps me co-excist with the chill

You make me sick because I adore you so
I love all the dirty tricks
And twisted games you play on me

Space dementia in your eyes
Peace will arise and tear us apart
And make us meaningless again

You'll make us want to die
I'd cut your name in my heart
We'll destroy this world for you
I know you want me to feel your pain

Space dementia in your eyes
Peace will arise and tear us apart
And make us meaningless again
