Passing by
You light up my darkest skies
You'll take only seconds to draw me in
So be mine
And your innocence I will consume

Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good

Hold your hands
Up to your eyes again
Hide from the scary scenes,
Supress your fears
So be mine
And your innocence I will consume

Dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good
Your dark shines
Bringing me down
Making my heart feel sore
Because it's good
