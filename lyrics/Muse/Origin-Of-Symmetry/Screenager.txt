Who's so phoney and always surrounded?
Stop you're screaming, no one can hear
All the scars on your skin, post no bills

Who you were
Was so beautiful
Remember who... Who you where

Hide from the mirror, the cracks and the memories
Hide from your family, they won't know you now
For all the holes in our soul host no thrills

Who you were
Was so beautiful
Memories who... Who you where
