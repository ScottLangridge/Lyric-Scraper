Royal Canadian blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
Matured for years and imported
Into my glass you poured it

And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me

The wild turkey's been chosen
Its caramel nose could smell me
Arbourler/Jameson I love you
The single malts came burning

And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me
