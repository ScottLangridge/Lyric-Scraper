Come into my life
Regress into a dream
We will hide
Build a new reality
Draw another picture
Of the life you could've had
Follow your instincts
And choose the other path

You should never be afraid
You're protected from trouble ahead
Why, why
Is this a crisis in your eyes again

Come to be
How did it come to be
Tied to a railroad
No-one to set us free
Watch our souls fade away
And our bodies crumbling
Don't be afraid

I will take the blow for you

And I've had recurring nightmares
That I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity
To be a better man
