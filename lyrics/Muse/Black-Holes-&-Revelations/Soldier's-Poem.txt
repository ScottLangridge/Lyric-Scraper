Throw it all away
Lets lose ourselves
Cause there's no one left for us to blame
Its a shame we're all dying
And do you think you deserve your freedom

How could you send us all far away from home
When you know damn well that this is all
I would still lay down my life for you

And do you think you deserve your freedom
No I don't think you do

There's no justice in the world

There's no justice in the world

And there never was
