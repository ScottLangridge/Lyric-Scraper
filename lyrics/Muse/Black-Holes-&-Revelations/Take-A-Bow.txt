Corrupt, you corrupt,
Bring corruption to all that you touch.

Hold, you'll behold,
And beholden for all that you've done.

And Spell, cast a spell,
Cast a spell on the country you run.

And risk, you will risk,
You will risk all their lives and their souls.

And burn, you will burn,
You will burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell.
You'll burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell for your sins.

Ooohhh.
Our freedom's consuming itself,
What we've become is contrary to what we want
Take a bow.

Death, you bring death and destruction to all that you touch.

Pay, you must pay
You must pay for your crimes against the earth.

Hex, feed the hex
Feed the hex on the country you love

Beg, you will beg
You will beg for their lives and their souls.

Yeah,
Burn, you will burn,
You will burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell,
You'll burn in hell, yeah you'll in hell,
Burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell for your sins.
