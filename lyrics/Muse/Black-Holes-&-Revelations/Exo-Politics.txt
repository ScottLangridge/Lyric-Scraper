Open the skies over me,
I am waiting patiently,
I'll wait for a sign.

As conspiracies unwind,
Will you slam shut,
Or free your mind,
Or stay hypnotised.

When the Zetas fill the skies,
Will our leaders tell us why,
Fully loaded satelites,
Will conquer nothing but our minds.

And I'm waiting patiently,
And I'll wait for the sign.

Carried through the centuries,
Secrets locked up,
And loaded on my back,
Well it weights me down.

When the Zetas fill the skies,
It's just our leaders in disguise,
Fully loaded satelites,
Will conquer nothing but our minds.

I'm waiting patiently,
And I'll wait for the sign. (Yeah).
I'm waiting patiently,
And I'll wait for the sign
