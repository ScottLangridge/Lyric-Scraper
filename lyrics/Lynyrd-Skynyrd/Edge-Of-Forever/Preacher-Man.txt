You know I'm dirty because it's in me
Life's not easy
And it's the heart that I won't change
I wouldn't be the same

You see me one day and then the next day
I don't wanna play
I'm not the same dog you have known
It's not written in stone

Well am I right or wrong
Lookin' out for number one
I never stay too long
I'm there and then I'm gone

I'm not the preacher man
Oh can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I've got and evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man
Yeah - yeah - yeah

Saint was a sinner
Ain't he a winner
And did you hear him say
I didn't lie I just misled
It's all in the head

Oh, ain't it funny
How little money
Cheap talkin' honey
Can turn a sunny day to gray
And we all got to pay

Oh, am I right or wrong
Lookin' out for number one
I never stay too long
I'm there and then I'm gone

I'm not the preacher man
Oh, can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I've got an evil eye
You know, sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man

Aah Aah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Aah Aah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah

I'm not the preacher man
Oh, can you understand
It's a game of win or lose
I got an evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man

I'm not the preacher man
I'm not the preacher man
I got an evil eye
You know sometimes I might lie
Oh, I'm not the preacher man
Aah Aah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Aah Aah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
