Mmmmmm
Whoo
That's right

Well the dogs are barkin' and I'm out rockin'
Nobody home to throw them a bone
I was thinkin' just the other day
Yeah on my way back to usa
Oh junk mail and bills in a letter box
Out on the line are my dirty socks
Had to jump the fence and break my lock
Yeah

Oh my God I'm back in fla
I got so much to do but I'm only here for a day
Wish I could pay for it while I'm in it
Seems like I'm there only for a minute
Me and the bank own a house down in fla
Aww yeah

What in the world am I gonna do
Clock on the wall says a quarter to two
Well the boys are on the bus and they're waitin' on me
I got soap in my eyes and I can't see
Telephone's ringin' baby's on the line
Tired of being here doin' my time
Gotta hit the road runnin' gotta get goodnight
Yeah

Oh my God I'm back in fla
I got so much to do but I'm only here for a day
Wish I could pay for it while I'm in it
Seems like I'm there only for a minute
Me and the bank own a house down in fla
Whoohoo

That's right

Oh wish I could pay for it while I'm in it
Seems like I'm there only for a minute
Me and the bank own a house
Yeah me and the bank own a house
Oh a run down shack
In fla
Yeah
That's right

Fla fla fla
Yeah
Ohoh
Whoo
