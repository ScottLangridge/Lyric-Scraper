Well, them four walls of Raiford closing in on me
Doin' three to five hard labor for armed robbery
I had two years behind me, but I could not wait the time
Every time I thought about it, well, I died some more inside

And I had stripes on my back; memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I get to work
Diggin' ditches for the chain gang; sleepin' in the cold
Oh, Lord, please forgive me for I could not wait no more

And I comin' home to see you, Jesus - well, it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on a soldier from the Florida-Georgia line
When they find me they must kill me - oh, Jesus, save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford - I can't take that anymore

These last few years behind me, oh Lord, have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say I'm guilty - when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime

Well, when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me
I had a pretty wife awaitin' and two kids I had to feed
Well I'm one of America's heroes
When they shoot me down won't you fly old glory proudly?
Put my medals in the ground

And I comin' home to see you, Jesus - well, it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on a soldier from the Florida-Georgia line
When they find me they must kill me - oh, Jesus, save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford - I can't take that anymore
