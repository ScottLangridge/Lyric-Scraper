(ronnie vanzant -- steve gaines)

Well, you can see her walkin' down on peachtree street
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek
She's lookin' good, she's headed downtown
Ain't got no money, honey
She knows her way around
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking georgia peach

Well these georgia peaches
Son they know their way around
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking georgia peach

Well, peaches, peaches
Love them georgia peaches
Well, peaches, peaches
Love them georgia peaches

Well them georgia peaches
Sure do got the style
They'll steal your heart with a southern smile
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
The older they get, I swear it's like good wine
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking georgia peach
Talkin' about a funny talkin', honk-tonking georgia peach

I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things
