Well, I'll tell you plainly baby
What I plan to do
'Cause I may be crazy baby
But I ain't no fool
Your daddy's rich, mama
You're overdue
But I ain't the one, baby
Been messing with you
Got bells in your mind, mama
So won't you pardon me
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe

Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
Your daddy's gonna take us in baby
'n take care of me
You know and I know, woman
I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweet heart
I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind, baby
So won't you pardon me?
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe
Time for me to put my boots out in the street baby
Are you ready boots -- walk on

All right there missy, let me tell you a thing or two
Now you're talking jive, woman
When you say to me
Your daddy's gonna take us in baby
'n take care of me
When you know and I know, woman
I ain't the one
That ain't my idea -- uh unh -- of having fun
Got rings in your eyes lady
So won't you pardon me
I think it's time for me to move along
I do believe
I must be in the middle of some kind of conspiracy
