(Al Kooper - Ronnie Vanzant - Bob Burns)

I've got my pistols in my pockets boys,
I'm Alabama bound.
I've got my pistols in my pockets boys, I'm
I'm Alabama bound.
Well, I'm not looking for no trouble
But nobody dogs me 'round.

Now well, I'm going to fetch my woman, people
Tri-cities here I come.
Oh, well, I'm going to fetch my woman, people
Tri-cities here I come
'Cause she was raised up on that cornbread
And I know she's gonna give me some.

Gimme some, babe...

Oh when the kid hits Alabama, people
Don't you try to dog him 'round.
Ah, when the kid hits Alabama, people
Don't you try to dog him 'round.
'Cause if you people cause me trouble,
Lord, I've got to put you in the ground.

Well, I was born in Mississippi
Babe, don't take any stuff from you
Ohah, I was born in Mississippi
And I don't take any stuff from you
And if I hit you on your head
Boy, it's got to make it black and blue.

Now, when  I go to Alabama
With my pistols out about by my side
'Cause, I ride to Alabama
With my pistols out about by my side
'Cause down in Alabama
You can run, but you sure can't hide
