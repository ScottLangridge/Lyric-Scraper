(m. Boren axton - tommy burden - elvis presley)

Since my baby left me, I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of lonely street at heartbreak hotel
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die

Though the place is crowded, you still can find some room
Where those broken hearted lovers cry away their blues
I get so lonely baby
I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die
I get so lonely
I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die
I get so lonely
I get so lonely, I get so lonely
