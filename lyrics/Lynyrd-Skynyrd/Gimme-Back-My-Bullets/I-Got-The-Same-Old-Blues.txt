Have you heard that rumor that's goin' around
My baby's got a man, lord way across town
Its the same old story
Tell me where will it end
Yes I heard the news it's the same old blues again

Well I wrote you a letter, must have read it wrong
Stood at the doorway and baby you was gone
Took a lot of courage
To let the telephone ring
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

Well you gave me the business, though I didn't mind
'Cause I got a lot of patience, Lord got a lot of time
Its the same old story
Tell me where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again
Here come my blues

Gonna find me a mountain and gonna hide out
Ain't talkin' to you babe, Lord I ain't comin' back
Well I heard that rumor, tell where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

Have you heard that rumor that's goin' around
My baby's got a man, lord way across town
Its the same old story
Tell me where will this end
Yes I heard the news it's the same old blues again
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

I got the blues... Same old blues
