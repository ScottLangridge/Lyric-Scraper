Let me tell ya,

Where I come from
It's grits and gravy
Not champagne caviar
Got pick up trucks ain't no mercedes
That's who we are
Ohhhhh
(Yeah I wouldn't change a thing)

I ain't no saint
Sometimes a sinner
And I can't tell you why
But I get up every morning
Thank the man above
(Ohhhh wooo my life is good)
Let me tell ya how good

Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down an old dirt road
That's how I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
Ain't nothing better than the sound of a crowd
American Flag it makes me proud,
That's how I like it - wooooooooo aaaa

Listen now

Ain't no cell phone towers
You won't catch me online
Workin with my hands for hours
That's how I spend my time
And I don't stand in line for coffee
It ain't my cup of tea
Out here in the country
We got everything we need

Oooooh woooooooooo
Yeah

Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down an old dirt road
That's how I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
Ain't nothing better than the sound of a crowd
American Flag it makes me proud,
That's how I like it

Ohhhhhhh

Wooooooo that's how I like it

(whistle)

Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down an old dirt road
That's how I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
Ain't nothing better than the Skynyrd crowd
American Flag it makes me proud,
That's how we like it
That's why we like it
That's how we like it
Woooooouhhhh
Mmmmmm
Yeahhhhh
