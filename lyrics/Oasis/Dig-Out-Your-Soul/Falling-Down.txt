Summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
Time to kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known.
Is all that I've ever known.
Is all that I've ever known.

Crying scream... It makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all
Summer sun
That blows my mind
Time to kiss the world goodbye

We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
Summer sun that blows my mind
Now we'll kiss the world goodbye
