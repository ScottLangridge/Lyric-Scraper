Heres a thought for every man who tries to understand
What is in his hands (what's in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
To find it if he can (to find it if he can)

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
(haaaaaaaa-ah)

As they took his soul they stole his pride (priiiii-hide) [-- 3 times
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

(haaaaaaaa-ah)
(haaaaaaaa-ah)
(haaaaaaaa-ah)
