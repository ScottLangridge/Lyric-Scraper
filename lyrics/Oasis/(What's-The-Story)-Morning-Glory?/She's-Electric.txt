Shes electric
Shes in a family full of eccentrics
Shes done things I've never expected
And I need more time

Shes got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind {made up now/mind made up now}
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what {I'm saying/what I'm saying}
But I need more
{cuz I'll be you and you'll be me/tiiiiii-iiime}
{there's lots and lots for us to see/ahhhhh-ahhhhh}
{lots and lots for us to do/ahhhhh-ahhhhh}
{she is electric/ahhhhh}
{can I be electric too? /ahhhhh}

Shes got a brother (a brother)
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me

Shes got a cousin (a cousin)
In fact she's got a dozen (a dozen)
Shes got one in the oven (oven)
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
I've got my mind {made up now/mind made up now}
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what {I'm saying/what I'm saying}
But I need more
{cuz I'll be you and you'll be me/tiiiiii-iiime}
{there's lots and lots for us to see/ahhhhh-ahhhhh}
{there's lots and lots for us to do/ahhhhh-ahhhhh}
{she is electric/ahhhhh}
{can I be electric too? /ahhhhh}
