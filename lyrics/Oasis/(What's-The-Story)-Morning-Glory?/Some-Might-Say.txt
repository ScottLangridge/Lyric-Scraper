Some might say
That sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine

Some might say
That we should never ponder
On our thoughts today cause they hold sway over time

Some might say
That we will find a brighter day
Some might say
We will find a brighter day
Yeah-ah!

Cuz I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again
Your sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And it was overflowing gently
But it's all elementary my friend

Some might say
They don't believe in heaven
Go and tell to the man who lives in hell

Some might say
You get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well

Some might say
We will find a brighter day
Some might say
We will find a brighter day (in a year)
Yeah-ah

Cuz I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again
Your sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
Ah my dogs been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again

Some might say (some might say) x2
You know what some might say (you know what some might say) x8
Woo!
