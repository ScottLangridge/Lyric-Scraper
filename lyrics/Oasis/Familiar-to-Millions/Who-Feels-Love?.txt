Found what I lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside

Thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years
Between my fantasy and fears
I feel love

Leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breathe
Now you understand that this is not the Promised Land
They spoke of..
There's nothing more to be
If you could be the remedy who heals love

I thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years
Between my fantasy and fears
I feel love

I thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years
Between my fantasy and fears
I feel love
