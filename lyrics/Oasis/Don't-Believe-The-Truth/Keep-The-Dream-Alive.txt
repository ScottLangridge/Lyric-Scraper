Four seasons, seconds, flicker and flash I'm alone
A lonely scream provides the scene, it's no home
Every night I hear you scream
But you don't say what you mean
This was my dream but now my dream is flown

Im at the crossroads waiting for a sign
My life is standing stilll but I'm still alive
Every night I think I know
In the morning where did it go
The answers disappear when I open my eyes

I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams colide
And even though i fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
I will keep the dream alive

Four seasons, seconds, flicker and flash I'm alone
A lonely scream provides the scene, it's no home
Every night I hear you scream
But you don't say what you mean
This was my dream but now my dream is flown

I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams colide
And even though i fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
I will keep the dream alive
