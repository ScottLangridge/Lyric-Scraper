Calling all the stars to fall,
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Call for me to set me free,

Lift me up and take me where I stand
She believes in everything,
And everyone and you and yours and mine

I waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me off my mind

Hey Lyla, the stars about to fall
So what you say Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so small Lyla
If you can't hear me call
Then I can't say Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall

She's the Queen of all I've seen,
And every song and city far and near

Heaven help my mademoiselle,
She rings the bell for all the world to hear

Hey Lyla, the stars about to fall
So what you say Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so small Lyla
If you can't hear me call
Then I can't say Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall

[Instrumental]

Hey Lyla, the stars about to fall,
So what you say Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so small Lyla
If you can't hear me call,
Then I can't say Lyla
Heaven help you catch me when I fall, Lyla

Hey Lyla
Hey Lyla
Hey Lyla
