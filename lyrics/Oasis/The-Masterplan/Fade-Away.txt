When I was young
I thought I had my own key
I knew exactly what I wanted to be
Now I'm sure
Youve boarded up every door

Lived in a bubble
Days were never ending
Was not concerned
About what life was sending
Fantasy was real
Now I know much
About the way I feel

Ill paint you the picture
Cause I don't think you live round here no more
I've never even seen
The key to the door
We only get what we will settle for

While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away
While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away
While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away
While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away, away, away
They fade away, away, away

Now my life has turned
Another corner
I think it's only best
That I should warn you
Dream it while you can
Maybe someday
Ill make you understand

Ill paint you the picture
Cause I don't think you live round here no more
I've never even seen
The key to the door
We only get what we will settle for

While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away
While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away
While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away
While were living
The dreams we have as children
Fade away, away, away
They fade away, away, away
They fade away, away, away
Fade away, away, away
