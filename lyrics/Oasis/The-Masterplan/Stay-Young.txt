One way out is all you're ever gonna get
From those who'll hand them out don't never let it upset you
Cos they'll put words into your mouths they're making us feel so ashamed

Making us take the blame
Making it cold in the night
Making you question my heart and soul
And I think that it's not quite right

Hey! Stay young and invincible
Cos we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
Cos we know just what we are

Feed your head with all the things you need
When you're hungry
Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday
Cos they'll put words into my mouth they're making me feel so ashamed
