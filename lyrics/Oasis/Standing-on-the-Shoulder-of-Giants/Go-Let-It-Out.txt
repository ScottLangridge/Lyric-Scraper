Paint no illusion, try to click with whatcha got
Taste every potion cos if yer like yerself a lot
Go let it out, go let it in, go let it out

Life is precocious in a most perculiar way
Sister psychosis don't got a lot to say
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out

Is it any wonder why princes & kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
And ordinary people that are like you and me
Were the keepers of their destiny

Im goin leaving this city, Im goin drivin outta town
Your comin with me the right time is always now
To go let it out, go let it in, go let it out
To go let it out, go let it in, go let it out

Is it any wonder why princes and kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
Cos ordinary people that are like you and me
Were the builders of their destiny
Were the builders of their destiny
Were the builders of their destiny
Were the builders of their destiny

So go let it out - go let it in
Go let it out - don't let it in
Go let it out - go let it in
Go let it out - don't let it - don't let it in
