Little James, We're all the same
They always seem to look to us
But we weren't meant to be grown ups
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

YOu live for your toys, even though they make noise
Have you ever played with plastercine
Or even tried a trampline
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
'Cos it wont be long before everyone is gone

Sailed out to sea, your mum you and me
You swam the ocean like a child
Life around us was so wild
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worth while to us

I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
And it won't be long before everyone is gone
