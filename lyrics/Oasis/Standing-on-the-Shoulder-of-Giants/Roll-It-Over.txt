I can give a hundred million reasons
To bulid a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here

Look around at the plastic people
Who lived without a care
Try to sit with me around my table
But never bring a chair

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here

Roll it over my soul and leave me here
To roll it over my soul and leave me here

Roll it over my soul and leave me here
To roll it over my soul and leave me here
