You know that feeling you get
You feel your older than time
You aint exactly sure
If youve been away a while

Do you the reciepts
For the friends that you buy
And aint it bittersweet
Youre only just getting by

But I hope you know
That it wont let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know
That it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?

And until youve repaid
The dreams youve bought for your lies
Youll be cast away
Alone under stormy skies
Alone under stormy skies

But I hope you know
That it wont let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know
That it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?

But I hope you know
That it wont let go
It sticks around with you untill the day you die

And I hope you know
That it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside

But I hope you know
That it wont let go
It sticks around with you untill the day you die

And I hope you know
That it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside

Where did it all go wrong?
