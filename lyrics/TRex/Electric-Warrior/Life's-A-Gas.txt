I could have loved you girl
Like a planet
I could have chained your heart
To a star
But it really doesn't matter at all
But it really doesn't matter at all
Life's a gas. I hope it's gonna last.
I could have built a house
On the ocean
I could placed your love
In the sky
I could have turned you
Into a priestess
I could have burned
Your fate in the sand
