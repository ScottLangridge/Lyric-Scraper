O God
High on your fields above earth
Come and be real for us
You with your mind
Oh yes you are
Beautifully fine.
Girl Electric witch you are
Limp in society's ditch you are
Visually fine
Oh yes you are
But mentally dying.
Boy
Just like a boat you are
Sunk but some how you float you do
Mentally weak
Oh yes you are
But so much you speak
