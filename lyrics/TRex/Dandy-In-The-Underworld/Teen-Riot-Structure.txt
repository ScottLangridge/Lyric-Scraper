Marc Bolan - guitar and vocal
Dino Dines- keyboards
Herbie Flowers- bass
Tony Newman- drums
Bud Beadle- baritone sax and flute
Chris Mercer- tenor sax
Teen riot structure, ankle deep in fear
Babies lost in bellies and the oracle can't hear
A demon angel demi-god blasted
Through the night
Me and Lucy Lightning holding on real tight
An ancient Lord in wonder rung upon my bell
I fed him with my nightmares
And he ate my dreams as well
All London was in blazes burning to the sound
Of deep galactic tragedies
In stereophonic sound
A tempest teen of stature in
Gatsby hat and cloak
Licked upon my lollipop,
But I didn't get the joke
As devastation mounted
My wardrobes almost burned
The teens held hands on shifting sands
And wonder what they learnt
Repeat in toto
Structure
Teen riot structure
Repeat
