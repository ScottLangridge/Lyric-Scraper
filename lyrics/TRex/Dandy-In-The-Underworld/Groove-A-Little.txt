To groove is to lubricate your imagination
You can call somebody captain
Under pressure you can flip
You can be a rock commando
But you can't pilot the ship
Groove a little baby, groove a little now
Groove a little baby, you might know
What you want
But I'll show you how *
You can trip the light fantastic
Become a space grotesque
You can fossilize your thought dreams
Behind a rusty desk
* Repeat
You might know what you want
But I'll show you how
You can read the works of Shakespeare
In the Academy of Life
You can punk the skunks of freedom
With you jeweled Etruscan knife
* Repeat twice
