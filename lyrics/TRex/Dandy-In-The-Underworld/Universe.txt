Hey there sister
Let's face the Universe and dance
Hey there sister
Let's face the Universe and dance **
We'll bop over the galaxies
We'll stroll over to Mars
We'll romance on Jupiter
Make love among the stars *
If you really love me sister
Let's face the Universe and dance
If you really love me sister
Let's face the Universe and dance

* Repeat
** Repeat x3
