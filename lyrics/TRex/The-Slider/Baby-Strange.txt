I see you walking
I see you talking
With all of my friends
I'm shadowed under you're like some thunder
I wanna be your friend
I wanna call you
I wanna ball you all night long
In winds of passion my whip is lashing
I wanna get you and then
Oooo you're strange
Don't lame me baby strage
Don't lame me baby
The city's shaking
I ain't faking baby this is the end
I'm overloaded my head's exploded
I wanna get you and then
