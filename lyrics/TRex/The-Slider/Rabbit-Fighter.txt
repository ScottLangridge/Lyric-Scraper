Shady politician in my bed
Tying bolts of lightning to his head
Call me rabbit fighter you know it's true
Cause babe i'll rabbit fight all over you
Tramp king of the city he's my friend
Moondog's just a prophet to the end
Call me rabbit fighter you knoiw it's true
Cause babe i'll rabbit fight all over you
I saw a dude unscrewed and badly turned
Laughing
Cause he'd gotten what he'd earned
Call me rabbit fighter you know it's true
Cause babe i'll rabbit fight all over you
Call me rabbit fighter
Jo jo don't you know
