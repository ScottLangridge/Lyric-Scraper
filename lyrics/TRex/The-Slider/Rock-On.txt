I've been down there
Everybody's been there
Everyone everyone
Desolation angel
On the cover of my paper
Loves everyone everyone
Rock on rock on
Mild mouthed rita
She's a chevy chase cheetah
Loves everyone everyone
Teddy's going steady
He's a silver-plated poet
Loves everyone everyone
Prophet pumped the car-scar
Deeper only sweeter
Loves everyone
