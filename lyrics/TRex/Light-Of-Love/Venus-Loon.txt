Oh yeah!
Oooooooh!

Gonna see my baby in the afternoon
Gonna take my baby on a venus loon!

Slipshod Jim's been in my neighborhood
Empty head steel bed
His tips 'is no good
All alone no telephone
To high vibe my room

Gonna see my baby in the afternoon
Gonna take my baby on a venus loon!

Oh yeah!

Been steep psychedelic
Woman's head
Gorging at my spokes
Like the ghosts were dead
Adam had 'em and
Puccini want my blues
But I'm

Gonna see my baby in the afternoon
Gonna take my baby on a venus loon!

Oh my Venus Loon it will make you swoon
It will make you feel good
It will make you feel good
(2X)

First girl I ever loved
I don't recognized
Her nose is smashed
Her fingers bent
She's covered in flies
Everyone I ever known
Give love to my lover.....

Oh my Venus Loon it will make you swoon
It will make you feel good
It will make you feel good
(2X)
