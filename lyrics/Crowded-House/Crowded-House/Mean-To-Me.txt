She came all the way from america
Had a blind date with destiny
And the sound of te awamutu
Had a truly sacred ring
Now her parents are divorced
And her friend's committing suicide

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
She said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me

So I talked to you for an hour
In the bar of a small town hotel
You asked me what I was thinking
I was thinking of a padded cell
With a black and white T. V.
To stop us from getting lonely

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
She said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me
No, I could not escape
A plea from the heart
Mysterious sympathy
I couldn't wait for a chance
To walk out the door
You know what it means to me

I saw you lying in the arms of a poet
I heard him tell you t... Tantalising lies
Well whad'd'ya know, whad'd'ya know

I could not escape
You're down on the floor
You know what it means to me
I couldn't wait for a chance
To walk out the door
Mean...
You know what it means
In the arms of a poet
You know what it means
