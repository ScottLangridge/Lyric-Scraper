Kill eye tumbling come out of the sky
Kill eye a fiery retreat from the stars
Kill eye he came clambering over the wall
Kill eye halfway to hell and beyond

I wanna be forgiven
I wanna laugh with children
Won't you ever forgive me
Please please forgive me
I wanna hug my mother
And the sky above her
I want the earth to open up
And hold me

Kill eye shoot your way out of the bank
Kill eye watch the security guard
Kill eye separate a man from his life

I wanna be forgiven
I wanna laugh with children
I wanna ride the pony
Be your one and only friend
I will love you till the end

Kill eye half way to hell and beyond
I wanna hug my mother
And the sky above her
I want the earth to open up
I want the earth to open up
