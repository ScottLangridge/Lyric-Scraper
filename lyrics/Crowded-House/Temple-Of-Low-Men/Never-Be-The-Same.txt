Don't stand around
Like friends at a funeral
Eyes to the ground
It could've been you

Why do you weep
For the passing of ages
You slip with the back of your hand
You're taking it out on the one you love
I couldn't believe it

But we might still survive
And rise up through the maze
If you could change your life
And never be the same

How long must I wait
For you to release me
I pay for each mistake
While you suffer in silence
I could still have an easy life
But the lie ain't worth the living
Once more will I hear you say

We might still survive
And rise up through the maze
If you could change your life
And never be the same

Don't stand around
Like friends at a funeral
Eyes to the ground
Don't suffer in silence

'cause we might still survive
And rise up through the maze
If you could change your life
And never be the same
Everytime I hear you
Never be the same
And everytime I mess up
Never be the same
