(neil finn)

No time no place to talk about the weather
The promise of love is hard to ignore
You said the chance wasn't getting any better
Labour of love is ours to endure
The highest branch on the apple tree
It was my favourite place to be
I could hear them braking free
But they could not see me
I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
It feels like nothing matters
In our private universe
I have all I want is that simple enough
There's a whole lot more I'm thinking of
Every night about six o'clock
The birds come back to the palm to talk
They talk to me, birds talk to me
If I go down on my knees
I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
It feels like nothing matters
In our private universe
And it's a pleasure that I have known
And it's a treasure that I have gained
And it's a pleasure that I have known
It's a tight squeeze but I won't let go
Love is on the table and the dinner's cold
I will run for shelter
Endless summer lift the curse
Feels like nothing matters
In our private universe
