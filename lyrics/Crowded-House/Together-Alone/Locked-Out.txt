I been locked out
I been locked in
But I always seem to come back again
When you're in that room
What do you do
I know that I will have you in the end
And the clouds they are crying on you
And the birds are offering up their tunes
In a shack that's as remote as a mansion
You escape into a place where nothing moves
And I been locked out
And I know we're through
But I can't begin to face up to the truth
And I wait so long for the walls to crack
But I know that I'll one day have you back
And the hills are as soft as a pillow
And they cast a shadow on my bed
And the view when I look through my window
Is an alterpiece I'm praying to for the
Living and the dead
Twin valleys shine in the morning sun
I sent the message out to my only one I been locked out and I know we're through
But I can't begin to face up to the truth
I wait so long for the walls to crack
But I know that I'll one day have you back
And I work with the bees and the honey
And every night I circle like a moon
And it's an act of simple devotion
But it can take forever
When you've got something to prove
I been locked out
