I like that middle initial
I like the way it serves me
I like the pigment in your skin
I like the way it moves me
I like kids when they're asleep
Their little arms around you
I like the way we play games
Don't lose that skin feeling

I'm looking old, I'm feeling young
It's the truth , my child
My second life has just begun
With this hungry girl

I like black and I like rain
I like that ornery circle
I like the things that you said
When you were misbehaving
I like the people on TV
The new one looks like me
I love you and you love me
Don't lose that skin feeling

I love the pigment in your skin
I love the way it moves me
I like the smell of that shock
I like the way it serves me
I like the things that you said
When you were misbehaving
I love you and you love me
Don't lose that skin feeling

It's the truth my child
Let me hold you high
