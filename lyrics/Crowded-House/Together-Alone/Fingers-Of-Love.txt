Recurring Dream Album 2nd SD

Can you imagine that
An itch too sensitive to scratch
The light that falls through the cracks
An insect too delicate to catch
I hear the endless murmur
Every blade of grass that shivers in the breeze
And the sound that comes to carry me
Across the land and over the sea
And I can't look up
Fingers of love move down
And I can't look back
Fingers of love move down

Colour is it's own reward
Colour is it's own reward
The chiming of a perfect chord
Let's go jumping overboard
Into waves of joy and clarity
Your hands come out to rescue me
And I'm playing in the shallow water
Laughing while the mad dog sleeps

And I can't look up
Fingers of love move down
And I can't look back (and I won't be hit [Album])
Fingers of love move everywhere
And there is time yet
For you to find me
And there is time yet
To fall by the way
From the cradle to the grave
To the palace, to the gutter
To beneath the dying waves of the sun
Lie the fingers of love

Through waves of joy and clarity
A fallen angel walked on the sea
And I'm playing in the shallow water
Laughing while the mad dog sleeps

And I can't look up
Fingers of love move down
And can't look back (and I won't be hit [Album])

Fingers of love move everywhere
There is time yet for you to find me
And all at once
Fingers of love move down

And all at once
Fingers of love move down
