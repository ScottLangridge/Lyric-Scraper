(neil finn)

Detective is flat, no longer is always flat out
Got the number of getaway car
Didn't get very far
As lucid as hell and these images
Movin so fast like a fever
So close to the bone
I don't feel too well
And if you choose to take that path
I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you
Sleeping alone for pleasure
The pineapple head it spins and spins
Like a number I hold
Don't remember if she was my friend
It was a long time ago
And if you choose to take that path
I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
Come flying like a spark to inflame you
Sleeping alone for pleasure
The pineapple head it spins and it spins
Like a number I hold
If she was my friend
It was a long time ago
And if you choose to take that path
Will you come to make me pay
I will play you like a shark
And I'll will clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark to inflame you
