Fork lightning in your hall
Break the skin when you break the fall
I'll be the one to fix it up

Love children of the new age
Just a hippy with a weekly wage
There's no rebellion just a chance to be lazy

When fame is in your blood
You follow the science of love
Wave the magic wand
And hang on

Now the rest of us are living in a daze
Keep thinkin' 'bout the choice to be made
Here come the handmaidens of end time

Lost treasure from a primitive race
All the lives written on your face
Can't fill the canyons of yor mind

When fame is in your blood
You follow the science of love
Wave the magic wand
And hang on

Now you've changed
And jumbled the pieces you've changed
You're better before you talked
To a roomful of strangers
Here come the handmaidens of end time

When fame is in your blood
You follow the science of love
Wave the magic wand
All of your stars will fall
And all of your spells will break
So look out for number one
Fame is in your blood
