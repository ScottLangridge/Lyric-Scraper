What'll I tell him
When he comes to me for absolution
Wouldn't you know it
Hope I don't make a bad decision

Cause I'd like to believe
That there is a god
Why sinful angels
Suffer for love
I'd like to believe
In the terrible truth
In the beautiful lie

Like to know you
But in this town I can't get arrested
If you know me
Why don't you tell me what I'm thinking

Hey don't look now
But there goes god
In his s*** pants
And his sausage dog
And he can't stand
Beelzebub
Cause he looks so good in black, in black

Hey don't look now
But there goes god
In his s*** pants
And his sausage dog
And he can't stand
Beelzebub
Cause he looks so good in black, in black

And there goes God
And there goes God
Over the bridge
And there goes God
He doesn't know the way home
