Well, she called up
And gave me the news
It made me so sad, sad, sad
There was nothing I could do

She's too far away
And you had to leave
I can never repay you now
For what you gave to me

Those who can blow a chasm wide
It took us all
It took us all

Pushed apart the mountains and the tide
It took us all

Well, she called up
And gave me the news
It made me so sad, sad, sad
There was nothing I could do

When I was so lost
In delirious sleep
I wasn't prepared for that position
Well, maybe I was na? Ve

And truth is a mortal blow
Well, you know all there is to know
Well, the hurt that you have so close
Is something better now

She called up
And gave me the news
It made me so sad, sad, sad
There was nothing I could do

Well, she was so lost
And confused
I can never repay you now
For what you gave to me

News
She called up
She called up
Well, she called up
And gave me the news
