A sigh from the deepest well
You can tell a lot without saying a thing
The truth, between us my friend
This longing
A sigh for lonliness to end
No changing the story now
A sigh from the emptiest part
It's a tender place
A sigh
Is more than I can bear
This show is not fooling anyone
And its all for you
But I think you're mind is made up
