English trees in my garden
We planted seeds in a faraway land
In between the palms and the succulent grove

They lose their leaves in the winter
Mark the seasons for him and for her
Once upon a time in the fallen snow
Up against the sky made a silhouette show

England cries and she plays for him
Two chords entwined like a requiem
Although it's springtime, colour is new
In Regent's Park, I will mourn for you

And I must be wise somehow
'Cause my heart's been broken down

It's so far to fall
And so hard to climb
Nothing's sadder, I know
Than the passing of time

Won't forget me
You won't forget me

English trees in my garden
Summer's missed you, my darling
And all your crimes are forgiven
Yeah, all your crimes are forgiven

And I must be wise somehow

English trees in my garden
