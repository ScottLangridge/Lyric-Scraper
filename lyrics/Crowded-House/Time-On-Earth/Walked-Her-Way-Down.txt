She walked her way down
It brought my mind back
From where I was trapped
How long will it take
For tension to break

Feel it sliding off
Shimmy-like cloth
I left on the ground

And I know what the answer is
And I'm happy to be here tonight

But when you're in the moment
Everything you want is right
But before she takes a step
She's waiting for the beat to arrive
And the drummer's counting out the start
She walked her way down

In silver and black
Tension is snapped
I picked up the trace
A scent I can't place
Remembering desire
Higher and high
Lift off the ground

And I know what the answer is
But I'm happy to be here tonight

And when you're in the moment
Everything you want is right
From before she takes a step
She's waiting for the beat to arrive
The drummer makes the same mistake

And my eyes are on the shape
That is captured in the light
All went quiet on the floor
When she walked her way down

As we happen to be here tonight
But don't we make a beautiful sight

And when you're in the moment
Everything you want is right
But before she takes a step
She's waiting for the beat to arrive

If you're tamed by all the pressure
Everything you want to become
The drummer always comes in late

And my eyes are on the shake
That is captured in the light

And I want to feel the weightless grasp
Upon my heavy life
