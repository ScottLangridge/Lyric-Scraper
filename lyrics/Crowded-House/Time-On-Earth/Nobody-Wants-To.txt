Down on the ocean floor
That's where I'm heading for
Hold on to a sinking stone
Until the worst is known

Nobody wants to
Think about it
Nobody wants to
Talk about it
Nobody protects you

They make it go away
Pretending that it's all okay
Broken pieces on the ground
And everyone's still turning 'round

Nobody wants to
Think about it
Nobody wants to
Talk about it
Nobody protects you

Are we losing something
We used to cry
We used to say why
For all I know
I might not get home
Well, I found out
If we opened it up
We could work this out

Nobody wants to
Nobody wants to
Talk about it now

What you suspected all along
Everything told you was wrong
And you can see it if you want
But nobody wants to
