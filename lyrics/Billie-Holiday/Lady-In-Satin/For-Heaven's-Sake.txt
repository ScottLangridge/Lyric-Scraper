FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
D.Meyer/Bretton/S.Edwards

For heavenssake let fall in love
It no mistake to call it love
An angel holding hands with me
How heavenly heaven can be

Here is romance for us to try
Here is a chance we can deny
While heaven giving us a break
Let fall in love for heaven sake
Don say a word my darling
Don break the spell like this
Just hold me tight; wee alone in the night
And heaven is here with a kiss

This pair of eyes can see a star
So paradise can be so far
Since heaven what wee dreaming of
For heaven sake, let fall in love
