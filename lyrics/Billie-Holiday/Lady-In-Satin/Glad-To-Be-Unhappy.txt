Lorenz Hart / Richard Rodgers

Look at yorself.
If you had the sense of humor,
You would laught to beat the band.

Look at yourself.
Do you still belive in rumor
That romance is simply grand?

Since you took it right
On the chin,
You have lost that bright
Toothpaste grin.

My mental state is all a jumble.
I sit around and sadly mumble.

Fools rush in, so here I am,
Very glad to be unhappy.

Unrequited love's a bore,
And I've got it pretty bad.
But for someone you adore,
It's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy,
I'm so unhappy,
But oh, so glad.
