Harry Woods

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you
You're in love
Your heart's fluttering all day long
You only stutter cause your poor tongue
Just will not utter the words
'i love you'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
He'll get bored
You can't resist him
All you'll say
When you have kissed him is
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
