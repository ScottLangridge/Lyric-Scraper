Harold Arlen / Ted Koehler

Blow, I'll wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good
No good

Go, I'll wind, go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that's no good

*
You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When love's to blame

So, I'll wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowin' me no good
No good

(Repeat from *)

Ill wind...
