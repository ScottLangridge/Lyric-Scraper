Goodmorning heartache
You old gloomy sight
Goodmorning heatache
Thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed 'til it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Goodmorning heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you nohow
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Stright through Sunday blues
Goodmorning heartache
Here we go again
Goodmorning heartache
You're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Goodmorning heartache
Sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you nohow
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Stright through Sunday blues
Goodmorning heartache
Here we go again
Goodmorning heartache
You're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Goodmorning heartache
Sit down
