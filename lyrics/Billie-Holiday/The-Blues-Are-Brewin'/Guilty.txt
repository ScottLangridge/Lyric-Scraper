Gus Kahn / Harry Akst / Richard Whiting

Is it a sin, is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime, then, I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you
Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night thru
If it's a crime, then, I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do?
What can I say?

After I've taken the blame
You say, "You're through
You'll go your way"
But I'll always feel just the same
Maybe, I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime, then, I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you
