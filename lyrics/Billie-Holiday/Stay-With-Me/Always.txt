Irving Berlin

I'll be loving you, Always
With a love that's true, Always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand, Always, Always

Days may not be fair, Always
That's when I'll be there, Always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But Always


I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand will understand
Always, always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always
