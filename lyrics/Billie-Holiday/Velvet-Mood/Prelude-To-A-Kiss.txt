Duke Ellington / Irving Gordon / Irving Mills

If you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to A kiss
If you hear a song that grows from my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to A kiss
Though it's just a simple melody with nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a simphony a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh! How My love song gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to A kiss.
