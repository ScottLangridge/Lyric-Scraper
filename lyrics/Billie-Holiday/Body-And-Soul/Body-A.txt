You're making me blue
All that you do
Seems unfair
You try not to hear
Turn a deaf ear
To my prayer
It seems you don't want to see
What you are doingg to me
My arms are waiting to caress you
And to my heart they long to press you, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering it's me you're wronging
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I can't believe it
It hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
Don't say it's the ending
I wish I could have one more change to prove, dear
My life a hell your'e making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you
Body and soul

Life's dreary for me
Day's seem to be long as years
I've looked for the sun
But can see none
Through my tears
Your heart must be like a stone
To leave me like this alone
When you could make my life worth living
By taking what I'm set on giving, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul
