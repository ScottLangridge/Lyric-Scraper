Billie Holiday / Herbie Nichols


Lady sings the blues
I'm tellin' you
Shes got them bad
Wants the world to know
Just what the blues is all about

Lady sings the blues
She tells her side
Nothing to hide
Now the world will know
Just what the blues is all about
The blues aint nothin' but a pain in your heart
When you get a bad start
When you and your man have to part
I aint gonna just
Sit around and cry
And now I know I wont die
Because I love him

Lady sings the Blues
I'm tellin' you
She's got 'em bad
But now the world will know
She's never gonna sing them no more

No more
