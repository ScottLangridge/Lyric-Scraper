Bishop / Williams / Raymond

Deep rhythm captivates me
Hot rhythms stimulate me
Can't help but swing it boy
Swing it brothers swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on swing me boy
Swing it brothers swing
Raring to go and there aint nobody
Gonna hold me down
Say listen boy

Hurry up and send me
Let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on kill me boy
Swing it brothers swing

Deep rhythms captivate me
Hot rhythms stimulate me
Can't help but swing it boy
Swing it brothers swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on send me Count
Swing it brothers swing
Rarin' to go and there aint nobody
Gonna hold me down
Say listen boy
Hurry up and send me
Let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on swing me Count
Swing it brothers swing
