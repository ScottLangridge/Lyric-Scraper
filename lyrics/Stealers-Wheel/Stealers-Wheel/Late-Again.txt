(Egan/Rafferty)

Late again, when I get home you'll be waiting.
Still you know there ain't no use in you complaining.
I know that I can show some respect, especially when I'm wrong.
But when I get back I know you'll say, "You've been away too long."

Ooooh, la-la-la, oooh...

I wonder why I stay when everybody's gone, yeah,
There's always something there, that keeps me hanging on.

Ooooh, la-la-la, oooh...

I wonder why I stay when everybody's gone away,
There's always something there, that keeps me hanging on.

I know that I can show some respect, especially when I'm wrong.
Late again, when I get home you'll be waiting.
