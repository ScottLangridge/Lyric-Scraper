Egan)

Time to turn the hay, listen, my Jose,
Pick up your (?) and get your day's work done,
Don't want to hear you talk to anyone.

You better get on your way, listen, my Jose,
Take off your shirt, you gotta earn your pay,
Ain't gonna wear it out there anyway, boy, d'ya hear? D'ya hear?

I know your life is in a mess,
You gotta get up, you can't afford to rest.
Can't you see my side, I got have my final (?)
Gotta do your best.
