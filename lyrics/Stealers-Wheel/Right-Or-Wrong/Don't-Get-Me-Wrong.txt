(Rafferty/Egan)

I can tell by your expression that there's something in the air
You think I'm holdin' out on you, you think that I don't care.

[Chorus:]
Oh no, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want to hurt you.
And maybe times I come on strong; it's only self-defense.
I can't deny that sometimes I appear so cold and heartless,
Then you become suspicious 'cause you can't make any sense out of me.

Every time we talk now it just ends up in a fight,
It starts off in the morning and it goes on through the night.

[Chorus:]

You say that I'm a stranger, and you don't know me anymore,
And I try not to listen 'cause I've heard it all before.

(fiddle solo)

Tell me what it is you want and I'll make it all come true,
'Cause I can't talk to anyone if I can't talk to you.

[Chorus:]

Oh, no, don't get me wrong...
Oh, no, don't get me wrong...
