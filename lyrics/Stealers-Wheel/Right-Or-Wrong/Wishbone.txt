(Rafferty/Egan)

Kill a chicken, get it with a spike,
You can cook it any way you like,
Tell me now if you'd like a taste,
On this old rooster nothing goes to waste.

Wishbone, wish for anything you want,
That old wishbone, gives you anything you want.

I'll take the wings and you can have the breast,
Never mind the feathers, think about the rest.
We don't want the head, we can cut off the feet,
Choke it by the neck and cut up the meat.

Wishbone, wish for anything you want,
That old wishbone, gives you anything you want.
