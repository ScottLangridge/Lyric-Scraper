(Rafferty/Egan)

Living way down here and you're way up there,
When I get this way, well, I can't feel you anywhere,
Can't feel you anywhere,
And I don't even care in this home from home.

The people in the room trying to let it go,
But everybody's so wound up they got nothing to show,
Baby, you'll never know,
Baby, I can't let go in this home from home.

It's so hard to leave you, it's hard now every time
You know how I need you.

I'm always here inside, I never see the day,
And when the nighttime comes I try and drink the blues away,
Drink the blues away,
Baby, I just can't stay in this home from home.

Take me away, you know I can't stay,
I can't take another day in this home from home...
