(Rafferty/Egan)

I was alone, I was so tired, down to my bones.
And you know everything, every little moment had lost it's ring.

[Chorus:]
I found my way to you, you came right out the blue,
And that was all you had to do, and I knew.
I couldn't get you out of my mind, you know I reached you just in time,
I found my way to you, and it's true.

Rise up everyday, it felt like you were a million miles away.
And I lie down every night, I needed you beside me to make it right.

[Chorus:]

(sax solo)

I found my way to you (found my way to you),
I found my way to you (found my way to you),
I found my way to you (found my way to you),
And it's true...

I found my way to you (found my way to you),
I found my way to you (found my way to you),
I found my way to you (found my way to you),
And it's true...
