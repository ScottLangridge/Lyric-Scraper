(Rafferty/Egan)

Well, I was working for the taxman,
Digging out the facts at the Inland Revenue.
I was slowly going nowhere, thinking it was somewhere,
There was nothing I could do.

I got wasted every day of the week,
And come Sunday, well, I just couldn't speak.
Monday morning always comes around too soon,
Monday morning always comes around too soon,
Monday morning always comes around too soon.

Well, I was getting more frustrated
At the longer I waited, I thought I was led astray,
And the only thing I knew was the sound of rock 'n' roll
Kept taking me away.

I got wasted every day of the week,
And come Sunday, well, I just couldn't speak.
Monday morning always comes around too soon,
Monday morning always comes around too soon,
Monday morning always comes around too soon.
