(Rafferty/Egan)

I was down and I was so hung up, drinkin' whiskey from a paper cup,
Can't get out of the mood I'm in, waitin' for everybody to begin,
Turn the wheel, come on we'll make me feel, just dig your heels, and we can fly.

She made me get up right out my seat, made me get up and move my feet,
She had me moving on down that line, everything was gonna work out fine,
You and me, feelin' free, if you'll agree, maybe we can touch the sky.

Never gonna stop, now we got the feel of it,
And if you want, well, we can make a meal of it,
Don't hold back, just let yourself go.
We don't have to be afraid of it,
And don't you know, well, we were made for it,
Don't hold back, just let yourself go.

Never gonna stop, now we got the feel of it,
And if you want, well, we can make a meal of it,
Don't hold back, just let yourself go.
We don't have to be afraid of it,
And don't you know, well, we were made for it,
Don't hold back, just let yourself go.

Oh, let yourself go, oh, let yourself go....
Don't hold back, just let yourself go.
