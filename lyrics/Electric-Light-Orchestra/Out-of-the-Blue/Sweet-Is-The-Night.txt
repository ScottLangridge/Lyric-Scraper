When the day is done and there's nowhere to run
And the people of the city have all lost and won
In your city dress, you stand and stare
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair

And the light that shines
Paints a trace of sadness
On the street I wait
But I can't seem to get to you

Well, you start to sway, check your Cartier
'Cause it's getting late, you can't afford to wait
So you move along where it's going on
And the people of the night are playing 'till the dawn

And the sun that shines
Paints a trace of sadness
In your eyes that cry
Wishing and hoping, oh

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

Well, you did your thing and you lost your wings
And you hurt so bad, you lost everything
And the tears that fall on the city wall
Will fade away

With the rays of morning light that shines
Paints a smile across your pretty face
I know everything is alright
Alright

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Sweet is the night

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Now you are near
