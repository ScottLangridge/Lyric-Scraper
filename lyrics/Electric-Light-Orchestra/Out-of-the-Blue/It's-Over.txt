Summer came and passed away,
Hardly seemed to last a day
But it's over and what can I do?
Music playin in the air,
Silence on a darkened stair
Cos it's over and what can I do?

Its over, it's over, all over,
Its all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down.
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of.

Feelin down, down, down,
Its all over.
Feelin down, down, down.
Baby, baby, it's all gone,
Rolled out to sea.

Lookin over sunny days,
Searchin for the righteous wave
Cos it's over and what can I do?
Lookin from this distant shore
You aint sailin by no more
Cos it's over and what can I do?

Its over, it's over, all over,
Its all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down.
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of.

Feelin down, down, down,
Its all over.
Feellin down, down, down.

Ah, it's over, it's over, it's over,
Its all over and what can I do?
Ah, it's over, it's over,
Its all over.

Oh, it's over, it's over.
Don't she'd a tear for me, it's over,
Don't she'd a tear although it's over.
