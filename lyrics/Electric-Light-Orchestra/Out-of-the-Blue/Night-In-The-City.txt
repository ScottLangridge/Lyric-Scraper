Standin at the airport lookin down the strip,
She was cryin her eyes, she was bitin her lip.
Seven-four-seven just left from gate eleven
And there's no turnin round cos it's just leavin the ground
And gettin higher higher.

Standin at the dock-side lookin out to sea
When I saw her but she did not see me.
There she stood with no hope because she'd missed the boat
And as her dreams sailed away she headed back for the day,
Back to the city city.

Night in the city, o-o-oh,
Madness at mid-mid-mid-midnight,
Night in the city drivin you insane.

In the city city

Night in the city, o-o-oh,
Madness at mid-mid-mid-midnight,
Night in the city drivin you insane.

I was runnin kinda lonely at the city place.
I waited for an hour, I never saw her face.
Crazy ladies that wait and slide around like a snake.
I just can't take anymore, I'm going in through the door
Into the city city.

Ill get you, yes, I'm gonna get you,
Ill get you, yes, I'm gonna get you,
Ill get you, yes, I'm gonna get you,
Ill get you, yes, I'm gonna get you,
Ill get you, yes, I'm gonna get you,
Ill get you, yes, I'm gonna get you,
Drivin you insane.

Night in the city, o-o-oh,
Madness at mid-mid-mid-midnight,
Night in the city drivin you insane,
Drivin you insane,
Drivin you insane.
