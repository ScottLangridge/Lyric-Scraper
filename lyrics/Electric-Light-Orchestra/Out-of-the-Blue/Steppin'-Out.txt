Pack up all your things
We're gonna be leavin'
Sooner than I thought
Take the things you bought
Clouds are gathering

Say goodbye to all your friends
We're gonna be sorry
For a while that's how it goes
But then again, who knows
About the rain

I'm steppin' out
I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
Steppin' out
I'm gonna be somebody
Ooh, I'm steppin' out

Did you hear what he said?
He said they sold me down the river
They thought I, thought I was a fool
They said the rain would fall
What did they know?

Then I saw your face
Heard the song that you were singing
Though I thought I knew the words
The tune was quite absurd and out of key
Doo dah dah dee

I'm steppin' out
I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
Steppin' out
I'm gonna be somebody
Ooh, I'm steppin' out

I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
Steppin' out
Steppin' out
Steppin' out
(Aaa aaa aaa)

Don't know where I'm going
Gonna see the world, gonna be somebody
Don't know where I'm going
I'm just steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
  (Aaa aaa aaa)
I'm steppin' out
  (Aaa aaa aaa)
