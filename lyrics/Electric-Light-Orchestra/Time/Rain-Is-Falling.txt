(Rain, rain go away, come again another day)

Early in the morning the sun was up and the sky was very blue
Without a warning as I looked out, my thoughts returned to you
A noise in the city made the children run and hide themselves away
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky

Looking from this window a thousand rivers running past my door
Standing on an island looking for someone upon the shore
I can see it very clearly, nothing's really changed
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky

Ooh, the rain is falling, ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling, will it wash away those lonely tears?
(It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring)

With their brand new time transporter
They'll think maybe I fought to get away
But with all their great inventions
And all their good intentions, here I stay

Down on the corner where the sun had shone
The people gathered round
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground

Ooh, the rain is falling, ooh, the rain is falling
I said "Ooh, the rain is falling, will it wash away those lonely tears?"
(It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring)

Ooh, the rain is falling, I said, "Ooh the rain is falling"
Ooh, the rain keeps on falling, falling, will it wash away those lonely tears?
(It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring)
(Rain, rain go away, come again another day)
