Monday: late again, today, hed be in trouble though
Hed say he was sorry, hed have to hurry out the bus.

Tuesday: horace was so sad, hed never had a girl that he
Could care for, and if he was late once more, hed be out.

Chorus

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door,
Well he just stood there mumblin and fumblin.
Then a voice from above said--
Horace wimp, this is your life,
Go out and find yourself a wife.
Make a stand and be a man,
And you will have a great life plan.

Wednesday: horace met a girl, she was small and she
Was very pretty, he thought he was in love, he was afraid.

Thursday: asks her for a date, the cafe down the street
Tomorrow evening, his head was reeling,
When she said yes O. K.

Repeat chorus

Friday: horace, this is it, he asks the girl if maybe they
Could marry, when she says gladly. Horace cries.

Sunday: everybodys at the church, when horace
Rushes in and says now here come my wife,
For the rest of my life. And she did.

Repeat chorus
