I don't know
I don't know what's on your mind
I thought everything was fine
But it was my surprise.

I don't know
I don't know what's going on
Something surely must be wrong
Youre living secret lives.

Chorus:
Living secret lives, secret lives
And I wonder where she goes to in the night
In secret lives.

Wish I knew
Wish I knew where I fit in
Wish that I knew everything
About your secret lives.

If it means
If it means that much to you
I don't want to stop the things you do
I don't need alibis.

Repeat chorus

I don't care
I don't care what goes on there
So long as one day I can share
Share your secret lives.

Repeat chorus

Repeat chorus

Repeat chorus

Secret lives, secret lives
Secret lives, secret lives...
