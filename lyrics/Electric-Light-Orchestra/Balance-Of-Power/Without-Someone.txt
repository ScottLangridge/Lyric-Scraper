I watch the cars move, I watch the lights upon the window
I walk along the street, I'm only thinking of you
I watch the clock staring from the wall
It hardly moves at all it's you I'm waiting for

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone

All alone, no one around, I watch the shadows falling faster
The city lights begin to glow and then I start to realize
I count the hours as they slip away
Into another day wondering where you'll stay

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone

Still watching the cars move, still watching the lights upon the window
I'm walking down the street, I'm only thinking of you
I hear the night as it calls to me
It plays a symphony, it says you're gone from me

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone

Without someone I can depend on
I'm lost without someone
As I go on, I hope you're remembering
I'm lost without someone
