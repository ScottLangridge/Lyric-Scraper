Dear Jo, I don't know where to begin, so I'll just hello
Dear Jo, is it so much better now you're on your own?
Is it alright? You never believed in yourself
Is it alright? But now that you're free, does it help?

Is it alright? Now, that you've got what you want?
And is it alright? Now, that you're back where you belong?

Dear Jo, are you living it up every place you go?
Dear Jo, if you're having a hard time, it sure don't show
Is it alright? You couldn't hold on in your mind
Is it alright? Now, is it okay? Is it fine?

Is it alright? Now, that you've got what you want?
And is it alright? Now, that you're back where you belong?

Dear Jo, can you believe that it's been so long?
Dear Jo, just thought I'd write and let you know
Is it alright? You never believed in yourself
Is it alright? But now that you're free, does it help?

Is it alright? Now, that you've got what you want?
And is it alright? Now, that you're back where you belong?

Is it alright? Is it alright with you?
Is it alright? Is it alright with you?

Is it alright? Now, that you've got what you want?
And is it alright? Now, that you're back where you belong?
Is it alright? Now, that you've got what you want?
And is it alright? Now, that you're back where you belong?
