Somebody told her that there
Was a place like heaven
Across the water on a 747
Yeah, we're living in
In a modern world

And pretty soon
She's really got the notion
Of flying out across
The big blue ocean
Yeah, we're living in
In a modern world

Talk is cheap on satellite
But all I get is (static)
Information, I'm still here
Redial on automatic

[Chorus:]
(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me
(Calling America)

But I'm just talking to a satellite
Twenty thousand miles
Up in the sky each night
Yeah, we're living in
In a modern world

All I had to do was
Pick up the phone
I'm out in space
Trying to talk to someone
Yeah, we're living in
In a modern world

She left a number I could call
But no one's there, no one at all
There must be something going wrong
That number just rings on and on

[Chorus:]

Said she'd call when
She'd been gone awhile
Guess she's missing me
Across the miles
Yeah, we're living in
In a modern world

[Chorus:]

Calling America, calling America
Calling America, calling America...
