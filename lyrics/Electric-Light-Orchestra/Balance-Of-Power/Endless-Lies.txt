Bye, bye, pretty woman
I've got to leave you now
I find you never really cared

Sometimes
I think I live on a merry-go-round
I don't know if I'm goin' up or down
On a merry-go-round

Endless lies, shined in your eyes

It's alright, count to ten
It will all be better then
It's alright, the world will go away

Sometimes
I think I live on a merry-go-round
I don't know if I'm goin' up or down
On a merry-go-round

Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes
The heartbreak is if you could only see
That's not the way it's supposed to be

And endless tears that flowed through the years
You take it all and then you take some more
Then you come runnin' back to me

Play on, pretty music
Play on and on for me
Shine on silver stars over the sea

Sometimes
I think I live on a merry-go-round
I don't know if I'm goin' up or down
On a merry-go-round

Endless lies, I see it in your eyes
Endless lies, shined in your eyes
