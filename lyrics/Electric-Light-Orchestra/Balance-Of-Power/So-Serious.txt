Night after night
I try to make it all fit together
Night after night
I see you as someone I remember
You took me by surprise
Opened up my eyes
Now we gotta talk this over.

Chorus:
Can it really be so serious?
To be all broken up and delirious
I guess weve really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?
(serious, so serious)

Day after day
I know it's not the way that you wanted it
Day after day
I try to find the key, but it don't fit
But you know how it is
No matter what I did
We gotta talk it over.

Repeat chorus

Tonight, tonight
I'm thinking over everything you said to me
Tonight, tonight
I'm sorry, but I just didn't see
And now it's up to you
There's nothing else to do
Weve gotta talk it over.

Repeat chorus

Serious, so serious
Is it so serious?
Serious, so serious...
