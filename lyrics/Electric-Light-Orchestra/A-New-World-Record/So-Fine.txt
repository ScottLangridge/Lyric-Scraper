Two drifters on the morning sky,
Two drifters sailing wide and high,
When summer breezes blow across your mind,
With you, I will walk the line.

Chorus
I want it so fine
I want it so fine
I want it so fine

People walking hand in hand,
Everybodys singing to the band,
I want to be where the stars shine bright,
And hear sweet music on a summer night.

Chorus -- repeat

Sundowners well go on and on,
Well find the land of the midnight sun,
And when you look you'll see for miles around,
Youll see, the world is in your hand.

Chorus -- repeat

Chorus -- repeat
