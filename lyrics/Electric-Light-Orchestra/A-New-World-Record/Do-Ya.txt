In this life I've seen everything I can see woman,
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun,
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching, picture slides
But I never seen nothing like you.

Chorus
Do ya do ya want my love
Do ya do ya want my face
Do ya do ya want my mind
Do ya do ya want my love

Well I, heard the crowd singin out of tune,
As they, sat and sang auld lang syne by the light of the moon
I heard the preachers bangin on the drums,
And I heard the police playin with their guns
But I never heard nothin like you.

In the country where the sky touches down
On the field, she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun,
They come arunnin just to get a look, just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't give a damn

Chorus -- repeat

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say woman,
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day,
I've seen enough of the world to know,
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow.

Chorus -- repeat
