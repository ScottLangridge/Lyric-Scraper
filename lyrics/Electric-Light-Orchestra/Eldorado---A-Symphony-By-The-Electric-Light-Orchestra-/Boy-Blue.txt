Hey boy blue, can't you hear all the noise, it's for you.
All the towns waiting there, let us go.
There's a show like you aint seen before.
Weclome home, where you been all these years, look around.
All the crowd is in tears,
Its so good to see you in the streets of your town

Chorus
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.

I've seen bold knights, dropping down like flies,
I've seen kings, rolling in the mire,
I've seen god, point the finger of doom to our foes.
I have fought in the holiest wars,
I have smashed, some of the holiest jaws.
I've been jailed, been impaled, and been dragged through the world.
One thing, I have learned through these years,
Is that no man, should be stricken with fear.
It should be that he walks with no care in the world.
So my friends, who are gathered today,
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say.
That no amn, shall cause me to take up arms again.

Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
Hey boy blue is back.
