Midnight on the water.
I saw the oceans daughter.
Walking on a wave's chicane,
Staring as she called my name.

And I can't get it out of my head,
No, I can't get it out of my head.
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head.

Breakdown on the shoreline,
Can't move, it's an ebbtide.
Morning don't get here till night,
Searching for her silver light.

And I can't get it out of my head,
No, I can't get it out of my head.
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head, no.

Bank job in the city.
Robin hood and william tell and ivanhoe and lancelot, they don't envy me.
Sitting till the sun goes down,
In dreams the world keep going round and round.

And I can't get it out of my head,
No, I can't get it out of my head.
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head, no.

No, I can't get it out of my head,
No, I can't get it out of my head.
Now my old world is gone for dead
Cos I can't get it out of my head, no.
