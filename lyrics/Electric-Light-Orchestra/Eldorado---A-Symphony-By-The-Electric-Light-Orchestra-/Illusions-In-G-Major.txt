An' on the seven seas, there was a phantom ship a comin'
Shinin' on the dead of night, I heard the crew a hummin'
Tunes that sounded like the Rolling Stones and Leonard Cohen
But they didn't know the words so I assumed that they was foreign
No, no

But I heard them just the same
Oh doctor, let me teach 'em
I just wanna please 'em, now
I said, "Doctor, let me teach 'em"
I just wanna please 'em, now

I looked up in the sky there was a phantom plane comin'
Shinin' in the dead of night, I heard the pilot sayin'
Poems that are written by John Keats and Robert Browning
He didn't know the words so I suppose that it was nothin'
No, no, no

But I heard them just the same
But doctor, let me teach 'em
I just wanna please 'em, now
I said, "Doctor, let me teach 'em"
I just wanna please 'em, now
Hey

So doctor, please believe me, I know you won't deceive me
But do these things I'm seein' have any hidden meaning?
It's all good entertainment, it doesn't cost a penny
So please doc, let me teach 'em, if I could only reach 'em

And I heard them just the same
Oh doctor, let me teach 'em
I just wanna please 'em, now
I said, "Doctor, let me teach 'em"
I just wanna please 'em, now
