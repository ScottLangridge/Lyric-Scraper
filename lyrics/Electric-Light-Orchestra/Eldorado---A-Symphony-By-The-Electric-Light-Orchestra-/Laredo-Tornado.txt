Summer days, where did you go
You've let me down so bad
Clouds fill the sky, gone is the dream
My happy hunting ground
Wild buffalo played and I never saw a rainy day
But it looks like summer days ain't coming back

March, April, May, June and July
You took me for a fall
Big chief he lie
Cold wind blows cool, so cold to make you die
Mountain breeze, ocean bay and I never saw a rainy day
But it looks like them summer days ain't comming back

Adios amigos

What can you do, when your dream world is gone
And your friends and lovers too, no no no no no no no

West Winter Street under the ground
The air that makes you choke
Towers of concrete, hellish go-round
Were there when I awoke city sky, pouring down with rain
That can never hope to ease the pain
And it looks like summer days ain't coming back
