Painted lady, stop that closin' in on me
Painted lady, you're supposed to be a dream
Painted lady, you better stay away from me

Painted lady, why you loosenin' my tie
Painted lady, what's that twinkle in your eye
Painted lady, you better stay away from me

Painted lady, with your jewels and your beads
Painted lady, don't you do these dirty deeds
Painted lady, you better stay here with me

Nobody's child till I saw the light of your smile
Painted lady, nobody's child, you have set me free
Nobody's child, you came in and stayed for a while
Painted lady, nobody's child, you have set me free

Painted lady, painted lady, painted lady
Painted lady, painted lady, painted lady
Painted lady, painted lady, painted lady

Painted lady, painted lady, painted lady
Painted lady, painted lady, painted lady
