I spent some time across the waves
I've learned a lot of things I never could
I waved my magic wand over the past
I never understood

It really doesn't matter at all
It really doesn't matter at all
If you found what you're lookin' for
It really doesn't matter at all

We moved around on different ground
There must have been some kind of reason
Nothing ventured, nothing found
Must have been the wrong season

It really doesn't matter at all
It really doesn't matter at all
If you found what you're lookin' for
It really doesn't matter at all

I flew you high, I flew you low
I flew you all the way around
You played for me your pretty tune
Now look what I have found

It really doesn't matter at all
It really doesn't matter at all
If you found what you're lookin' for
It really doesn't matter at all

It really doesn't matter at all
(Doesn't matter at all)
It really doesn't matter at all
(Doesn't matter at all)

If you found what you're lookin' for
(Doesn't matter at all)
It really doesn't matter at all
