One, two, three

Tell me I'm mistaken
I must be kinda slow
But the only time you ever cared
Was when you needed more

Easy money, easy money
You got out of control
And you sold your soul for
Easy money

If you see a sucker
Standing at your door
Bring him in and make him grin
Then take him to the store

Easy money, easy money
Watch out from above
You broke into the bank of love
Easy money

Some people never learn to stop when they've had enough
Easy money, easy money
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough

I've come to the conclusion
It's like the old man said
The only thing you gave me
Was shit and promises

Easy money, whoa whoa whoa, easy money
One day you'll have to earn
All the money that you burn
Easy money

Take it, Jeff

Easy money

Whoa, whoa, yeah

Some people never learn to stop when they've had enough
Easy money, easy money
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough

Funny thing about it
Don't even make me blue
'Cause there's no better deal around
Than saying goodbye to you

Easy money, easy money
You snatched that cash
Right into your stash
Easy money

You got out of control
And you sold your soul
For easy money

Easy money, woo woo woo, easy money
