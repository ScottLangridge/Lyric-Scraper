Falling through the endless sky
The signals dance upon the twilight
Calling out to reach someone
Who waits there in the lonely night

Just for love
Just for love

Soon beyond the melting clouds
The light will shine on everyone
That waits there in the silver rain
To meet the golden sun

Just for love
Just for love
Just for love
Just for love

I came a long way 'cross the water
Came a long way to get here
Round and round in great big circles
Tryin' to ease my fear

Out in all the mysteries
And distant new tomorrows
There goes another one
Don't know which way the wind blows

Just for love
Just for love
Just for love
Just for love

Love
We're gonna get it right
Just for love
We're gonna get it together

Love
We're gonna get it right
Just for love
We're gonna get it together

Love
We're gonna get it right
Just for love
We're gonna get it together
