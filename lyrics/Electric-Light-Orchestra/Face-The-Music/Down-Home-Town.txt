The world outside don't like us much,
Cos they aint got our classy touch,
But they aint good enough to breathe,
This towns good air we make em leave.

Chorus:
But it's no, no, no, you really can't do that,
No, no, no, down homw town.

No monkey business in this town,
Well who do you think you're pushing round,
This towns respectable and clean,
Just look around you'll see what I mean.

Chorus: repeat

Down home town, down home town, etc.

Chorus: repeat

We got the best town band around,
Just listen to their crazy sound.
When they get hot they gonna blow,
Ucedemwinnin** every show.
Down home town, down home town, etc.

Chorus: repeat

Look out.
