I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

I can hear your voice
I can hear your voice
Like the bells on Christmas Day

And in despair I bowed my head
"there is no peace on earth" I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

(Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men)

Till ringin' singin' on it's way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chant sublime
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men
