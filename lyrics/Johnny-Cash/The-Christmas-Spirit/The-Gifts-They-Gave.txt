Jesus our King
Kind and good
Was humbly born
In a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts
Around Him stood
Jesus our King
Kind and good

"I", said the donkey
Shaggy and brown
"I carried
His mother up and down
I carried His mother
To Bethlehem town"
"I", said the donkey
Shaggy and brown

"I", said the ox
"This was my hay
I gave Him my manger
'Twas here that He lay
I gave Him my manger
'Twas here that He lay"
"I", said the ox
"This was my hay"

"I" said the sheep
With pearly horn
"I gave Him my wool
For a blanket warm
He wore my coat
On Christmas morn"
"I", said the sheep
With pearly horn

"I", said the dove
From the rafters high
"I sang Him to sleep
That He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep
My love and I"
"I", said the dove
From the rafters high

And so every heart
By some good spell
In the stable dark
Was glad to tell
Of the gift
That he gave
To Emmanuel
Of the gift
That he gave
To Emmanuel
