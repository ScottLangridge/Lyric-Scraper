I got a crib full of corn, and a turnin' plow
But the grounds to wet for the hopper now.
Got a cultivator and a double tree
A leather line for the hull and gee
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for Country Trash

I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The winds from the south and the fishings good
Got a pot belly stove a quart of wood
Mama turns the left-overs into hash I'm doing alright for
Country Trash

I got a machina and a hunting dog
A cap I ordered from the catolog
A good tall tree that shades the yard A good fat sow for the winters lard
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for
Country Trash

Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And the crops need fertilizer now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for
Country Trash And
God's got a heaven for
Country Trash
I'll be doing alright for
Country Trash
