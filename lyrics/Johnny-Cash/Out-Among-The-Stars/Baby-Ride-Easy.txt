Johnny Cash: If I drove a truck
June Carter: And I were a waitress
Johnny: And I ordered coffee
June: And I poured you some

Both: Then you'd stop by on your way sometimes later
June: And if we arm-wrestled
Johnny: I'd say that you won

Both: I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
June: If your loving is good
Johnny: And your cooking ain't greasy
Both: Well chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

June: If I were a winsome pale senorita
Johnny: And I a bull-fighter, way down in the sand
Both: While the band kept on playing that Old Paso Doable
June: Would you throw me a flower
Johnny: Would you take my hand?

Both: I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
June: If your loving is good
Johnny: And your cooking ain't greasy
Both: Well chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

Johnny: If I ran the country
June: I'd be your first lady and Id pick up the white house while you were away
Both: Waiting while youre passing time with world leaders
June: Left alone together Both: Alone we might lay


Both: I need my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
June: If your loving is good
Johnny: And your cooking ain't greasy
Both: Well chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

June: If your loving is good
Johnny: And your cooking ain't greasy

Both: Hey!
