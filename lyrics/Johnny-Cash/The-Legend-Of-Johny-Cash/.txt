With The Tennessee Three

Well, I saw you with another
It made me lose my mind
Shot you with my.38
And now I'm doing time

And you put me here
You put me here

Well, there's no way to doubt it
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

I've been trying to tell em
That I didn't do no wrong
Only gave you what you been
Deserving all along

And you put me here
You put me here

There ain't no use in denying
You done it with your lying
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Well, the jury found me guilty
They wouldn't hear my plea
I listened as that judge said
Murder in the first degree

And you put me here
You put me here

Well, there ain't
No need to doubt it
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Now the warden and the preacher
They're lettintg me go slow
It won't be long until I'm gone
Just thirteen steps to go

And you put me here
You put me here

There's just one way to figure
Your cheating pulled the trigger
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Well, there ain't
No need to doubt it
There ain't no two ways about it
As sure as your name's Kate
You put me here

Kate, you're just plain bad
You know that
