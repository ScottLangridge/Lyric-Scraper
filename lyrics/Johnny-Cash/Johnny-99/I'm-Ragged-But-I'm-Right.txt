Well, I've come here to tell you folks, I'm ragged but I'm right
I'm a tramp and a gambler, I stay out late at night
But a Porterhouse steak three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer in this big town can afford

Well, I've got a electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy playin' around at my feet
I'm a rambler and a gambler, I've lead a dirty life
Well, I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

Well, then I got married, I knew I'd settle down
And I built a little love nest right here in my hometown
Now, I've got a family, one that I'm proud of
I know that we'll be happy, 'cause they're the ones I love

I've got a big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy playin' around daddy's feet
I'm a rambler and a gambler, I've lead a dirty life
I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right
I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

I'm a rambler and a gambler, I've lead a dirty life
But I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right
