Saw a girl in Tampa
I asked her for a date
She said, "Baby, I'm a sailor
This thing better waits"

I said, "I don't believe you
Would you show me some proof"
She showed me her tattoo
Then I knew that that's the truth

Met a woman on a highway
By the exit sign
You'd bet your last dollar
That she was forty-nine

But she swore to me
That she was still in her youth
When I turned down the lights
I knew that that's the truth

Had a girl on a border
I guess, she was shy
Never spoke a word in years
Not even hi

But one night she said
"Honey, we're gonna raise the roof"
She put on some dancin' shoes
Then I knew that that's the truth

I knew a preacher's daughter
In fact I knew her well
He said, "Son, you better ramble
Unless you've got somethin' to sell"

It's an eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
He pulled out a forty-four
Now I know that that's the truth, that's the truth
