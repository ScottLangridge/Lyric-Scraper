Well, now sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning, honey in the evening, honey at supper time
Be my little honey and love me all the time

Put your arms around me, swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
Sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time
Be my little sugar and love me all the time

Now sugar time is anytime that you're near
Oh, you're so dear
Now don't you roam just be my honeycomb
And live in a heaven of love

Well, sugar in the morning, sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning, honey in the evening, honey at supper time
Be my little honey and love me all the time
