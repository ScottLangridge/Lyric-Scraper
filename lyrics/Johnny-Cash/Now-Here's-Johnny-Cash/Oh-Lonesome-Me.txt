With The Gene Lowery Singers

Everybody's going out
And having fun (having fun)
I'm just a fool for staying home
And having none (having none)

I can't get over
How she set me free
Oh, lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making
By just hanging round
(Hanging round)
I know that I should have
Some fun and paint the town
(Paint the town)

I've thought of everything
From A to Z (A to Z)
Oh, lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys
With all her charms
(All her charms)

But I still love her so
And, brother, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here
In my arms (in my arms)

Well. There must be some way
I can lose these lonesome blues
(Lonesome blues)
Forget about the past and
Find somebody new (somebody)

I've thought of everything
From A to Z (A to Z)
Oh, lonesome me

(Oh, lonesome me)

Well, I'll bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys
With all her charms
(All her charms)

But I still love her so
And, brother, don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here
In my arms (in my arms)

Well. There must be some way
I can lose these lonesome blues
(Lonesome blues)
Forget about the past and
Find somebody new (somebody)

I've thought of everything
From A to Z (A to Z)
Oh, lonesome me
Oh, lonesome me
