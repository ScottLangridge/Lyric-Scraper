Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadows
I'll be here, oh Danny boy, I'll miss you so.
But if you fall, as all the flowers are falling
And If you're dead, as dead you well may be
I'll come and find the place where you are lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for thee.
Repeat But come ye back...
And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me
I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
