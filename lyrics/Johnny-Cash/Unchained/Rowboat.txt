Rowboat Row me to the shore
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
She don't wanna be my friend no more
Pick me up Gimme some food to eat In you . . .
Goin' no place
I'll be home
Talkin' to nobody
You'll be strange
You'll be far away
Big fat moon
And my body's out of tune
With the burnin' waves
She's a billion years away
