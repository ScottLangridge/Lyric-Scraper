What a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning the great speckled bird 

And to know that my name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word 

Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes 

They long to find fault with her teaching but really she makes no mistakes 

[ guitar ] 

I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am glad that my name is on her book 

For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Saviour to look 

And when he come up descending from heaven on a cloud like he said in his word 

I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of the great speckled bird
