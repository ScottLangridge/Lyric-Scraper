One day you'll learn
When you get hurt,
By then it will be too late for ya,

Be too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns, don't you know?

He's just a kid of the estate
We call him little Jake
Today he tried to buy weed with his little mate
Up in the bits, but he's just a kid
So he was open to manipulation
He had to undergo initiation
And when some older boys saw the situation
They took the piss, now look at this
Will you be his up and only friend
The only one that won't pretend
And even gave me the money for depend
From mice to men, and then to rats
But only a snake behaves like that
But the gun don't care for fool shooting gaps
They just happy they could fall for the trap

Playing with fire, it doesn't burn
First time, your hand,
Walk through the pain
Playing with fire, it's too extreme
Oh-oh-oh
Scare tin, skin now
Hell on it's way
Playing with fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Go playing with fire
One day you'll learn
When yo get burned
By then it'll be too late for ya
Too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns
Don't you know
Playing with fire

He's just a kid, but he feels like a man today
He joined a gang today
Been at a house party, you ran away
Doing illegal shit, but he's just a kid
Still he's in luck today
He got a fuck today
Yeah he bust his very first nut today
In some stupid bitch
Today's moving quick
So quick, if you wear the wrong shoes
You'll slip,
Better keep up with the tempo, with a click
Cause what they on is messed up rough
And now that he's rolling with these vexed up thugs
What's next up...
Cause he's gonna it his only mission
To bet his position, in this little gang it's a competition
To a little man with a disposition
Holding though he was born a Christian
What he worships now is the night they listen
Wise men will tell you with age comes wisdom
And you can't be saved by religion unless you have faith
So it makes no difference to the use, to erasing the system
You don't have age on your side
... Row models and lies that provide insight
So he ain't gonna listen
As for Jake, he's already made his decision
And now he's just another poster boy
For David Cameron's Broken Britain

Playing with fire, it doesn't burn
First time, your hand,
Walk through the pain
Playing with fire, it's too extreme
Oh-oh-oh
Scare tin, skin now
Hell on it's way
Playing with fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Go playing with fire
One day you'll learn
When yo get burned
By then it'll be too late for ya
Too late for ya
When the fire spreads and burns
Don't you know
Playing with fire
