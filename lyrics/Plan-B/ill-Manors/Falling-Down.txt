Follow me as I descend into madness
With gladness,
For years I've been surrounded by this badness
No time to waste
It's high time I escaped out the foresters gate
I'm sorry mate but these ends are in a sorry state
You can't relate
Yeah well you can fuck off can't you mate
Your heart is fake
Can't appreciate how this artist paints
My art is great
It's my mind that's in darkest place
I can't erase
The memories I have of a darker days
The darker days
That left a bitter after-taste
I've passed the stage
Of trying hard to mask this rage
I'm letting go
Calling out to god to let him know
I'm falling on my own
No court please don't attempt to save my soul

[Chorus:]

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

No back-pack
Just a tramp making tracks
I'm cool like Keith
Making friends with the rats
Observing how they act
They ain't begging for my scraps
They ain't cats
They'd rather wait until I turned my back
No turning back
Maybe now's the time to turn to crack
I've learned the facts
Way before I learnt to rap
This place is mess
The people here they don't praise success
They hate it yes they don't want to see you make progress
That's why they test
Try to knock you to the ground
You pick yourself up
That's when they knock you back down
The university of life blud
That's where I got my schooling
I know that they can't knock me down
As long as I keep falling

[Chorus:]

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down

You get up off the ground
Take a look around
Lost yourself off that's when they knock Back down
