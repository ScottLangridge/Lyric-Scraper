The night is 75 there was this chick named Janet 
A pregnant heroin addict who said she didn't plan it
So never thought to stop, or ever kick the habit
'Cause Kirby let her do it and she knew he always had it
Down in his cellar with Trevor another addict
Who was at it like an asthmatic trapped in an attic
Sucking on an asthma punt 
Though you never know by looking at him that's the cunt
Who by 1983 was in the national front
Yeah he had a shaved head but still got mashed on drugs
So Kirby didn't mind him hanging round that much
Especially anytime Janet came round to fuck
Get her fix while her kid Chris waited around
A nine year old boy he was healthy and loud
'Cause even when she was pregnant she was smoking around
And she was ducking that he wasn't born disabled somehow

Still when you're too loud you get a clap round your head
Kirby ain't his dad but he does what he says
Stays downstairs in the cellar with Trev
While Kirby's upstairs giving Janet her meds
At least that's what they tell Chris still he ain't that dumb
He knows Kirby's upstairs banging his mum
While he's left in the basement with some racist cunt
Who's been waiting round for ever for his mother fuckin' day to come

Mr drug dealer

What an environment to raise a kid
Round crack dealers, heisters and racist pricks
Trevor, looted the place as well as maiming Chris
Left a permanent scar on his face the same as his
With a, razor blade yeah takes the piss
Whether you prejudice or not man he's just a kid
But that's what Trevor done no one ever saw him after that
6 years past now Kirby's hookin' up the crack
It's the new drug everybody's going crazy for
1989 the year Chris started selling draw
Picking up from Kirby, scar there beneath his eye
Think after everything that's happened he would treat him right
But par him off with just another ounce of weed
'Cause a quarter of the bag is a bunch of fuckin' seeds
Hundreds of them and twigs the size of fuckin' trees 
But if he ever moaned he get a slap across his cheek

1990 is the year that really took it's toll 
'Cause that's the year his mother Janet took an overdose 
Of heroin and died, god rest her tortured soul
Now he's left to fend for himself or by his own

Mr drug dealer

it's 1995, now that he's older stress weighs on his shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but he hides it from his olders
He's been living on the far side since he was a youth
But the way he lives now is a far cry
From the way he, did in the past 'cause he's
Made his way up from sellin' ounces to bars of weed
Out In the streets, where people do their nasty deeds 
He sees em making money so he wants a larger piece
He's a man now, 21 years of age
It's been a couple years since Kirby's palms were raised
Lost in anger, ended up across his face 'cause he's a man now
And Kirby knows he's past his stage of gettin' beats
Still that don't change the way he treats
Chris when he comes round to his, to get his weed
Kirby don't like his attitude he's cocky now believe
So again he palms him off with more twigs and fuckin' seeds

But Chris ain't havin' none of it he ain't no little kid now
He squares up to Kirby who really don't look that big now
And really can't do shit now but pay Chris what he owes
And weed but also pride 'cause that what Chris takes when he goes
Kirby knows he's getting old, and that's what really hurts
He ain't cut out for this work the way he once was upon a time
But he don't know no other way to make a living on the grind	
Selling drugs is all he's been, his only way of getting by

Then the cops come round undercover fed come shut him down, lock him down
15 years away from now, the youth will grow, a big and strong and take control
Have it ah, that's the way it goes
