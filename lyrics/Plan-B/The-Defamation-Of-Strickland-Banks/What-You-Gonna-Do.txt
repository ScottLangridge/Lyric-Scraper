You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do

So here we are again, it's like dj vu
Everyone lookin' at me tryin' to work out if I've been telling the truth
The courtroom's the same, but the jury's changed
And the judge is a she not a he still they all look the same to me, yeah
It's just like it was, when I was here before
'Cept my ex ain't here in the gallery showin' me support
And that breaks my heart, cause I love her no doubt
Still I know a song, I can sing if I ever get out
But the chances of that even with this new evidence
Comin' to light don't change the fact
An innocent man went down first time,
Man I'd be a fool to put my faith in them
Only to be misplaced again, I remember how my heart felt breakin' then
It don't wanna feel that hate again,
Just do your worst cause it won't break again

You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do

Yeah I've been through the wars, up in that jail
What you got to do is look at the scars
On my face to know that I've been through hell
But I'm still breathin', yeah that's right I'm still here
I survived through the darkest days
In the darkest place from my darkest fears
Ain't nothin' you can do to me, ain't already done 'cept shootin' me
And people havin' a pop ain't nothin' new to me,
That's what used to go on usually
When I stay too long in one place,
Will I get this new face by many more fights
How different would things be now, if I'd just made it home that night
Ain't even worth thinkin' about,
What's done is done, you can't change the past
Just please stop torturin' me and make a decision that's all I ask
'Cause I'm ready to accept my fate, whatever the outcome of this case
The only thing I can't stand is the wait,
So hurry up already and decide today

You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do

So what you gonna do, when you gonna make up your minds
I've been here for hours now
And I still ain't got a clue what you got in line
Are you gonna send me back through the prison gates like you did before
Or are you gonna set me free and let me live my life and know the score
I'm sick sittin' here listenin' through
This girl with the lies when I know the truth
And I always have, she has too, the only people left to convince is you
The jury's out on me, once again, what's new
And now I'm past caring what fate they choose for me
Just do what it is you're gonna do and
Do it soon so I can get up out this room

You can let me go, you can let me rot
Wait for parole, wanna do the rest of the years I've got
You can cut me loose, or you can bang me up
'Cause to tell the truth, I don't really give a fuck

You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up (Bang me up)
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturin' me tell me what you're gonna do, what you gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just don't need me on a cliffhanger
