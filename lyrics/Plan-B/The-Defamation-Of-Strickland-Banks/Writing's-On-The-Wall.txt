We used to have fun,
Now all we do is fight.
I know somethings wrong,
It's clear something here ain't right.

We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all.
We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
This time next year we'll be no more.
(oh yeah)

Talk about tomorrow girl,
It's only gonna end in tears baby, yeah.
I challenge my role girl,
All we got left is right here.

We used to talk,
Now all we do is shout.
(oh yeah)
Our heads full of thoughts,
We could both do without.
(ooh ooh)

We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all.
We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
This time next year we'll be no more.
(oh yeah)

Talk about tomorrow girl,
It's only gonna end in tears baby, yeah.
I challenge my role girl,
All we got left is right here.
(ooh ooh yeah)
All we do is try,
Try to make it all okay baby, yeah.
We both know it's a waste of time,
Things are never gonna change.
(oh oh)

We both know we're hanging on here,
But no-one's gonna say it.
So we'll just carry on like always,
Acting like nothing's wrong, yeah.

We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all.
We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
This time next year we'll be no more
(oh yeah)

We ain't over but the writings on the wall,
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all.

This time next year we'll be no more
