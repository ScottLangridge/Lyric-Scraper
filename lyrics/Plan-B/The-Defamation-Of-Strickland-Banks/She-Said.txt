She said I love you boy, I love your soul
She said I love you baby, oh oh oh oh ohh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayayby
So I said, what you sayin girl it can't be right
How can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
So she said, boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door
She said but I love you boy, I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh ohh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayayby (Yes you did)
So now I'm up in the courts
Pleading my case in a witness box
Telling the judge and the jury
The same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
I'm innocent I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by
Someone she's obsessed with
She likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That's why love goes down not to lose it
Cos she can't seperate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
But my girl cries tears in the galleries
Got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song about the Zuton Valerie
So the jury don't look like they're buying it
And she's making me nervous
And I'm just screw faced like I'm trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murderer's
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down
Even though I told them she
She said but I love you boy, I love your soul
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh ohh (Yes you did)
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayayby
So I said, why the hell you gotta treat me this way
You don't know what love is
You wouldn't do this if you did
Oh no no no noo
