I know what's to come
... feeling happy now
I know when I'm drunk
... never lets me down
Cos I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
I'm in a brawl
Cos I wont take it lying down
Right inside the bar
The police are on their way right now
Cos I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
Yeah I always stay too long
The ladies better singa my s-s-s-song, s-s-s-s-song, s-s-s-s-song, s-s-s-song
I got my peeps standing with me shouting pull up your socks
Cos we just broke the law and now we're running from cops
I got my lip bust fighting now there's blood on my top
And I'm still out looking for a party, somewhere to stop
I got my peeps them telling me they know where it's at
So I pull out twenty notes and jump straight into a cab
I'm on my way to where I'm going thinking I need more Jack
But that probably aint the brightest idea I've ever had cos
I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
On the run from the law
I'm looking worse for wear
I go through a door
And suddenly I find myself somewhere
Somethings bound to go wrong
If I stay too long
I know were going to get to dawn
... stay singing my s-s-s-song, s-s-s-s-song, s-s-s-s-song, s-s-s-song
S-s-s-s-song, s-s-s-s-song, s-s-s-song song song
Cmon
Cmon
Cmon, Cmon, Cmon, Cmon
I got my peeps standing with me
At the bar doing shots
Cos now we're so fucking plastered
We don't know when to stop
I got my girlfriend ringing me
Belling me up
I know I should probably answer
But I just can't be fucked
I got my peeps standing with me
And I'm having a blast
I'm feeling so fucking good right now
I want it to last
So I put my phone on silent
And I refill my glass
The music so fucking banging
Feel like I wanna dance
I'm at the bar and I see this chick checking me out
From afar yes you are...
Looking at me as if to say
I'm in with a shot
So I pull a chair up near
And buy us a drink
She says cheers I says yeah
Our glasses go clink
Now I'm being bad, in a cab, groping this girl
Once the cab is paid
We make our way to the hotel
Now I'm in a lift, getting licked, how dumb is this girl
But do I care? do I fuck!
I'm on a roll!
