Lord Above, I just killed a man,
Let somebody take the blame,
Lord above, I'm knelling down,
My pray take away this pain all up in here.

I'm prayin', Lord I'm prayin' to you,
Take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleading, lord I'm pleading with you,
We got some dealings to do before the day I'm dead.

He came for me just like I knew he would,
But this time I was ready and I killed him good.
But we weren't alone, there was one more left
He took my weapon from me, put it to the test.
When this angel appeared out of the dark,
With the devil in his eyes but god in his heart.
He slayed him down,
Saved me from a sudden death,
But I've still done wrong, so now

I'm prayin', Lord I'm prayin' to you,
Take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleading, lord I'm pleading with you,
We got some dealings to do before the day I'm dead.

So there we are,
An angel and a man,
Both just standing there,
With blood on our hands.
What we gonna to do now,
This what I thought.
But before I could say it the angel talked.
He said I'm in here for life, anyway,
Your only in here for five ill take the blame.
So go right now don't feel ashamed,
But 'o lord I do that's why I pray!

I'm prayin', O' Lord I'm prayin' to you,
Save me from these sins weighing down on my soul.
I'm pleading, lord I'm pleading to you,
Got some healing to do inside I'm feeling low.

I'm prayin', Lord I'm prayin' to you,
Take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleading, lord I'm pleading with you,
We got some dealings to do before the day I'm dead.

I'm prayin', O' Lord I'm prayin' to you,
Save me from these sins weighing down on my soul.
I'm pleading, lord I'm pleading to you,
Got some healing to do inside I'm feeling low
