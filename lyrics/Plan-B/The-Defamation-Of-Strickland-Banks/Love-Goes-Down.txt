I Remember When I Was Young
And So Were You, All After Things,
We Both Said We Would Never Do,
But Look How Times Have Changed Baby,
You Know I, I Could Never Say No Baby,
I Can Only Show You How,
My Love Goes Down,
My Loves Goes Down, Down, Down,
Yeah Baby,
Sweep Your Feet Right Off The Ground,
In My Mind I've Got That Real Love For You Now,
Yeah Baby, I Got That Real Love For You Now,
I Remember When I Did You Wrong,
Made You Cry,
Made You Feel So Sad,
I Knew I Had To Apologize,
So I Pulled You Close Baby,
And I Laid You Down On The Bed,
Took Off Your Clothes Baby,
Girl You Know The Rest,
My Love Goes Down,
My Loves Goes Down, Down, Down,
Yeah Baby,
Sweep Your Feet Right Off The Ground,
In My Mind I've Got That Real Love For You Now,
Yeah Baby, I Got That Real Love For You Now,
Baby Can't You See
You're The Only One For Me
Girl You Know it's True
I'm No Hero For You
Love Goes Down
Wohoo Girl My Love Goes Down, Down, Down
Yeah Baby Sweep Your Feet Right Off The Ground
Yeah I Got That Real Love For You Now
Yeah Baby, Know I Got That Real Love For You Now
