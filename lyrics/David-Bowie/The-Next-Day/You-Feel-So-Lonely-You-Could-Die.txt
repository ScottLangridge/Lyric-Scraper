You Feel So Lonely You Could Die
No one else saw you moving through the dark.
Leaving slips of paper somewhere in the park.
Hidden from your friends,
Stealing all they knew.
Love is thrown in airless rooms.
Thin vile rewards for you.
Im gonna tell. Yes, Ive got to tell, gotta tell
The things youve said
When youre talking in the dark.
And Im gonna tell the things youve done
When youre walking through the park.
Some night on a thrill-less street
Will come a silent gun.
Youve got the dangerous part.
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun.
Theyll come such a dart and it's needle
On a crowded train.
I bet youll feel so lonely you could die.
Buildings crammed with people.
Landscape filled with wrath.
Grey concrete city.
Rain has wet the street.
I want to see you clearly
Before you close the door.
A room of blood history.
You made sure of that.
I can see you as a corpse
Hanging from a beam.
I can read you like a book.
I can feel you falling.
I here you moaning in your room.
Oh, see If I care.
Oh please, please, make it soon.
Walls have you cornered.
Youve got the blues, my friend.
And people dont like you.
But you will leave without a sound or a God, an end.
Hopefully, I love you.
Death along shall love you.
I bet youll feel so lonely you could die,
You could die.
Feel so alone, you could die.
You feel so lonely you could die.
