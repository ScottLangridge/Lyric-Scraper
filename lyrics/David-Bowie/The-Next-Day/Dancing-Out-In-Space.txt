Now some guys say they're legman
And other prefers blondes
And some guys go for tna
Of all these I am fall
But there's one thing that I earned for this much as true as I know
The women turns my head like the one who would gamble Joe
Nigga' girls are all from the North
Oooh
With a big... 
Sleakin' out of the slim... 
I ask the one to dance with a yo-yo in her pants
I cannot reason why this tought I can declipse
And nothing get's me quiet as ** lips
I'd like the gamble of Joe because it comes in Andy when
I need another place to hold my pounting pen

...
