(Bowie)

Living in lies
By the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear
That the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

Chorus
So I'll wait
Until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed
And all the same
Full of blood, loving life
And all it's got to give

Englishman going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

With great expectations
I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored,
So I'll never get old

Chorus

Day after
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien
Day after
Day
Day after
Zane, Zane, Zane
Ouvre le chien
Day after
