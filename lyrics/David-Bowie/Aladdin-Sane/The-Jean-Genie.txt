Small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lazers and slash back blazers
Ate all your razorswhile pulling the waiters
Talking bout monroe and walking on snow white
New Yorks a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little greenie, woo ho
Get back home

The jean genie lives on his back
The jean genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean genie let yourself go!

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
Shell scratch in the sand, wont let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little greenie, woh ho

The jean genie lives on his back
The jean genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean genie let yourself go oh

Hes so simple minded he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved
Woh ho
Woh ho

Aoo jean genie lives on his back
The jean genie loves chimney stacks
And he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The jean genie let yourself go! Go

Go

Jean genie lives on his back
Jean genie loves chimney stacks
And he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean genie let yourself go woh ho go
Go go
