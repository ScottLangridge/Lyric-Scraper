Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do [x2]

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise
Can do

Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords
Offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
[x2]
Dance to the noise

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she
Knows what the noise
Can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric
Goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern
Song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but
She knows what the noise
Can do

Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need
You
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
