Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured it's prey it would drape the skeletons
Over it's web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with
Almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew
Thru this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive somehow
On their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They she'd tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry,
Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)

Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise
In your lovin' eye.

God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back
'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you,
Savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along
Before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back
'cause the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back
'cause the water's all gone
