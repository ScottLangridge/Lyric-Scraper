I'm waiting for the man
Twenty six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, One Two Five
So sick and dirty more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man

Hey white boy, what you doing uptown?
Hey white boy,
You're chasing all the women around
Oh pardon me sir
It's furthest from my mind
I'm just looking
For a good friend of mine
I'm waiting for the man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Pr shoes,
And a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is
That you've always got to wait
I'm waiting for the man

Brown stone building
And three flights of stairs
Nobody stops you
'cause nobody cares
He's got the works
And he gives you sweet taste
But then you've got to split
Because you've got no time to waste
I'm waiting for the man

Baby don't you holler,
Darling don't you scream and shout
I'm feeling good,
I'm going to work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow
But that's just another time
I'm waiting for the man

I'm waiting for the man
Twenty six dollars lying there in my hand
Up to Lexington, One Two Five
So sick and dirty more dead than alive
I'm waiting for the man
