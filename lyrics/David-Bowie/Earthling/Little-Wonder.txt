Stinky weather, Fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc,
Grumpy gnomes
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder,
Little wonder you
Big screen dolls,
Tits and explosions
Sleepytime, Bashful but nude
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder,
Little wonder you
I'm getting it

Intergalactic, see me to be you
It's all in the tablets,
Sneezy Bhutan
Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder,
Little wonder you
Mars happy nation,
Sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away
Little wonder then,
Little wonder
You little wonder,
Little wonder you

[CHORUS]
Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

Little wonder
You little wonder, you
Little wonder
You little wonder you
