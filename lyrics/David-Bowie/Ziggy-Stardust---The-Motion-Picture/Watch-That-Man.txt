Shakey threw a party
That lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band
Of married men
Looking up to me
For encouragement
- it was so-so

The ladies looked bad
But the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better
- it was so-so

Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

[CHORUS]
Watch that man!3 Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and
Spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman 1fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits3were joking
The manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled
With the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played
The Tiger Rag3
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

[CHORUS]

Watch that man [repeat ad inf.]
