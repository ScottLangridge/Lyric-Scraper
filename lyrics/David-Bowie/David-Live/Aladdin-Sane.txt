Watching him dash away, swinging an old bouquet - dead roses
Sake and strange divine uh-hu-hu-uh-hu-hu you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, takes him away to war - don't fake it
Sadden glissando strings
Uh-hu-hu-uh-hu-hu - you'll make it

Wholl love aladdin sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Wholl love aladdin sane

Motor sensational, paris or maybe hell - (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for aladdin sane - you'll make it

Oooh wholl love aladdin sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Oooh wholl love aladdin sane

Well love aladdin sane
Love aladdin sane

Oooh wholl love aladdin sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Oooh wholl love aladdin sane

Well love aladdin sane
Well love aladdin sane

Oooh wholl love aladdin sane
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Oooh wholl love aladdin sane

Well love aladdin sane
Wholl love aladdin sane

See the lights shine oh so bright on broadway
