I don't wanna lose the good thing that I've got
For if I have do, I will surely, I will lose a lot
For your love is better than any other love other I've known

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood, baby

I got superstitious about you but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood, yeah

It's no secret but that woman fills my lovin' cup
Thus she sees to it that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known

It's like thunder
It's like lightning, yeah
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood

Baby, oh yeah
I better knock, knock, knock
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
I better knock, knock, knock
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)

Oh, knock, knock wood
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
You know that I would [Incomprehensible], alright
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)

It's no secret
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
No, oh, you better
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)

Yeah that I've known
(Yes, you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
I can't leave her alone
Oh no, baby, knock on wood
