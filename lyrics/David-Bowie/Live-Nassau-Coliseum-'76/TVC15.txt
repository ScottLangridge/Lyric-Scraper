Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, he's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my tvc15, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in my [Incomprehensible]
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my tvc15
Oh, so demonic, oh my tvc15

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
"Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature"
My tvc15, he just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby
Then we'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

My baby's in there someplace, love's rating in the sky
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

Transition, transmission, transition, transmission

Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15
Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15
Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15
Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading
Send back my dream test baby, she's my main feature
My tvc15, he just stares back unblinking
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby
Then we'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

She's my baby, somewhere, someplace, love's rating in the sky
So hologramic, oh my tvc15

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh

Transition, transmission, transition, transmission

Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15
Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15
Oh my tvc15, oh oh, tvc15
