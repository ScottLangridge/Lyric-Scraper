This aint rocknroll. This is genocide!

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod brownings freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(will they come?)
Ill keep a friend serene
(will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the diamond dogs
Young girl, they call them the diamond dogs

The halloween jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of manhattan chase
The elevators broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, diamond dogs are sableized

(will they come?)
Ill keep a friend serene
(will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the diamond dogs
Young girl, they call them the diamond dogs

Oo-oo-ooh, call them the diamond dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the diamond dogs

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(there's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

(will they come?)
Ill keep a friend serene
(will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.
Come out of the garden, baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the diamond dogs
Young girl, they call them the diamond dogs

Oo-oo-ooh, call them the diamond dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the diamond dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the diamond dogs
Dogs
Call them the diamond dogs, call them, call them
Call them the diamond dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the diamond dogs

Keep cool
Diamond dogs rule, ok
Hey-hey-hey-hey

Beware of the diamond dogs
Beware of the diamond dogs
Beware of the diamond dogs
Beware of the diamond dogs
Beware of the diamond dogs
