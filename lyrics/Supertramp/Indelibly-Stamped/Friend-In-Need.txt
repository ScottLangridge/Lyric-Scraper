Hey buddy want to  talk to you
'Bout a  friend in need, a friend indeed
I hear you got a few friends too
Live up the stairs, selling their wears
And they don't care, 'cause they don't know that

Oooh he's very lonely
Oooh he's lost his one and only
Woman that he's ever had
He sure feels bad, can you make him glad?
Hey mister can you help him out?
Can you put him straight, before it gets too late
And show what it's all about

Hey mister well he's got the dough
How much will it be, to pay the fee?
I guess that you can see through me
So I'll be straight with you, I'll tell the truth
Friend in need is just really me
