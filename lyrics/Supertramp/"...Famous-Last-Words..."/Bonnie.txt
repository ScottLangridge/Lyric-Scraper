Your silver nights and golden days
I try to reach you in a million ways
I'm crazy 'bout you Bonnie
Can you tell?

Your diamond rings and fancy clothes
Do I want you babe, well heaven knows
I'm wild about you Bonnie
Can't you see hey Bonnie

I've love you oh so long
I know we'd get along
Hey Bonnie will you ever notice me

Yes I know you oh so well
Just one look and I fell
Please tell me that our love will always be

I've seen your films and all your plays
I read about you every single day
I'd lke to get my lovin' arms 'round you
