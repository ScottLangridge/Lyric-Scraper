Just look at the comfort that you call your home,
Just kidding yourself that you're never alone;
Well, maybe there's something, just one thing, you shouldn't have said,
So, you better beware.
And, you better get, and you better get, light in your head
And, you better get, and you better get, peace in your head.
If you wanna get, if you wanna get high.

You're watching the movie go blistering by
Just look at the sadness, I wish I could die;
Well, maybe there's something, just one thing, that I should have said.
Well, it better be said.

Has the record been, has the record been holding your heart,
It's beginning to, it's beginning to squeeze you apart.
Don't you wanna get, don't you wanna get high.

You're holding the world in the palm of your hand,
Watch'ya tellin' your children you don't understand

If you know what the meaning is X7
Meaning is X3

Oh-oh so you better beware,
So you better get, so you better get light in your head,
So you better get, so you better get peace in your bed;
Don't you wanna get, don't you wanna get high

Just look at the madness that glows in your eyes,
Don't you frighten the children, who'll steal your disguise,
If you know what the meaning is X8
If you know what the answer is X4
If you know what the meaning is X4
