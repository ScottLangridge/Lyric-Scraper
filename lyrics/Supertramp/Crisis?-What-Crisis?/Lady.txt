Lady, you come across the water,
Well don't you think you oughta?
Be waiting a while,
Are you acting, on what your heart has told you,
Is nothing gonna' hold you, from flying away, a-ha
Flying away a-ha, flying away.

'Cause there's nowhere to go,
Though the road is out stretching before you,
And the farther you go,
I said,
-Ain't nothing gonna get you to heaven-
I said,
-Ain't nothing gonna get you to heaven-
And you know just who you are
And you know that there's something between us,
And you like what you feel, but
-I can tell that you're not gonna turn back-
-Well I can tell that you're not gonna turn back-
And don't you know I'm a little bit sad, oh-no

Oh-la-la-la-la *4   Arrgh *3

Mister, you better get a move on
You better get a fix on,
Mmm-you better walk straight.
I said Lady, oh just take me if you want me, oh,
Take me as you find me,
Oh, I'm needing your love so bad *3

And there's nowhere to go,
Though the road is out stretching before you,
And the farther you go,
I said,
-Ain't nothing gonna get you to heaven-
I said,
-Ain't nothing gonna get you to heaven-
And you know just who you are
And you know that there's something between us, and,
You like what you feel, but,
-I can tell that you're not gonna turn back-
But,
-I can tell that you're not gonna turn back-
And don't you know I'm a little bit sad, sad, sad, sad.
(Takin' the long way, and no turning back)
