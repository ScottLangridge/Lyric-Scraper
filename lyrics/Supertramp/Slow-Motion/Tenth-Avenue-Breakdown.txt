Well now how you doin' do I know you
Are you living round here or just passing through
Seems like I met you before well how you do

Take care while you're in there, the lights are low
Though the gals are good, they're not the kind you want to know
Just sit back, and drink a stiff one - enjoy the show

They got nothing on me, nothing I can see, nothing that could do me wrong
Cos I'm in my disguise they'll never get wise
Ain't nothing that can cause alarm

One hit that'll do you. You won't look back
You'll be feeling no pain. Put you right on track
Why don't you do it again ah now you're getting the knack

Let's go to a new place, the lights look good
Reflecting the rain across the neighborhood
Who's that over there, looks like he's up to no good

"Hey what you doing to me, is that a knife that I see
Well are you trying to bring me down
I'm a tryin' to run but my legs are all numb
It's like I'm messin' with the wrong side of town"

You're on the wrong station, you're on the wrong track
You've lost your reservation, now you can't get back
You're getting a shake down, unlucky for you
Tenth Avenue breakdown...

"It's getting rough, just  too tough
I'm all abused and so confused
I've got to go, I feel so low, just can't wait
It's gettin' late... "

Spoken: {Policeman's words]
Get down now...
Put your hands behind your head......
You have the right to remain silent....
Anything you say can be used against you....

"Don't know who came he just set upon me
It's kind of vague and I'm, I'm kind of  groggy
But you must believe me, he just stopped breathing
I didn't do it, it wasn't me
I know it wasn't me"

Gettin' late we can't afford to wait
It's gettin' late we can't afford to wait [repeat]
You're on the wrong station, you're on the wrong track
You lost your reservation and you can't get back
You're getting to shake down, unlucky for you
Tenth Avenue breakdown

It's getting rough, it's  just  too tough
I'm all abused and so confused
I've got to go, feel so low
Just can't wait
