So you think you're a Romeo, playing a part in a picture-show
We take the long way home, take the long way home
Cos you're the joke of the neighbourhood, why should you care if you're feeling good
Take the long way home, take the long way home
There are times that you feel you're part of the scenery, all the greenery is comin' down boy
Then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture, oh it's peculiar, she used to be so nice

Lonely days turn to lonely nights, you take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home, take the long way home
You never see what you want to see, forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home, take the long way home
When you're up on the stage it's so unbelievable, unforgettable, how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity, oh calamity, well is there no way out?

(Ooh, take the long way home)
(Take it, take it, take it home)

Does it feel that you life's become a catastrophe, oh it has to be for you to grow boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been, oh what might have been if you'd had more time
So when the day comes to settle down, who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home, you took the long way home, you took the long way home (Same thing again)
You took the long way home, you took the long way home (For luck), you took the long way home
You took the long way home, you took the long way home

Long way home, long way home, long way home
