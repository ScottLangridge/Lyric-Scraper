Jimmy Cream was keen, his brain was always winnin',
I can't keep tabs on mine, it's really quite a joke
I see him down the road, I ask if he'd be willing
To lend me 15p - I'm dying for a smoke
Don't arrange to have me sent to no asylum
I'm just as sane as anyone
It's a just a game I play for fun - for fun.
I told em - look! - I said I'm not the way you're thinkin,
Just when I'm down, I'll be a clown, I'll play the fool.
Please don't arrange to have me set to no asylum
It's just a game I play for fun - for fun.
Will he take a sailboat ride?
He is very likely to,
Will he feel good inside?
He ain't very likely to,
Will he tell you he's alive?
He is always trying to
But nothin', no nothin', does he say
In the morning when the day's begun
- "Hello Good morning, how are you?"
And in the evening or the noonday sun
- "What a lovely afternoon!"
Well I've been living next to you

Bluesy Monday is the one day that they come here,
When they haunt me and taunt me in my cage.
I mock them all, they're feelin' small, they got no answer
They're playin' dumb but I'm just lauging as they rage
Don't arrange to have me sent to no asylum
It's only a game I play for fun
I've been foolin' everyone - everyone.
Will he take a sailboat ride?
He is very likely to
Will he feel good inside?
He ain't ever likely to
Will he tell you he's alive?
He is always tryin' to
But nothin', no nothin' does he ever say
In the morning when the day's begun
- "Do you think it looks like rain"?
And in the evening or the noonday sun
- "You know I nearly missed my train"
Well I've been living next to you my friend
But what kind of friend are you?
Is it the beginning or the sorry end?
Will I ever see it through?
I've never been insane
Oh what's the game?
I believe I'm dying...
He's mad, mad, mad...
Not quite right...
Oooooooooo..............
