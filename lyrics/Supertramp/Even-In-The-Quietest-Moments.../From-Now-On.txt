Monday has come around again
I'm in the same old place, the same old faces always watching me
Who knows how long I'll have to stay?
Could be a hundred years of sweat and tears at the rate that I get paid
Sometimes I slowly drift away from all the dull routine that's with me every day
A fantasy will come to me
Diamonds are what I really need
Think I'll rob a store, escape the law and live in Italy
Lately my luck has been so bad
You know the roulette wheel's a crooked deal, I'm loosing all I had
Soon be like a man that's on the run and live from day to day, never needing anyone
Play hide and seek throughout the week

My life is full of romance

Guess I'll always have to be, living in a fantasy
That's the way it's got to be, from now on
Guess I'll always have to be, living in a fantasy
Though it won't be really me, from now on
You think I'm crazy, I can see
It's you for you and me for me
Living in a fantasy from now on
Guess I'll always have to be (Guess I'll always have to be), living in a fantasy (Living in a fantasy)
That's the way it's got to be (That's the way it's got to be), from now on
Guess I'll always have to be (Guess I'll always have to be), living in a fantasy (Living in a fantasy)
It's you for you and me for me (It's you for you and me for me), from now on
Guess I'll always have to be (Guess I'll always have to be), living in a fantasy (Living in a fantasy)
That's the way it's got to be (That's the way it's got to be), from now on
Guess I'll always have to be (Guess I'll always have to be), living in a fantasy (Living in a fantasy)
It's you for you and me for me (It's you for you and me for me), from now on and on and on
Guess I'll always have to be (Guess I'll always have to be), living in a fantasy (Living in a fantasy)
That's the way it's got to be (That's the way it's got to be), from now on
