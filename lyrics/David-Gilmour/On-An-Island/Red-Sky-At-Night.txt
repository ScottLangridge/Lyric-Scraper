This kind of love is hard to find
I never got to you by being kind
If I'm the one to throw you overboard
At least I showed you how to swim for shore

When you're down is where you'll know yourself
That if you drown there's nothing else
When you're lost you need to find yourself
Then you'll find out that there's no-one else
