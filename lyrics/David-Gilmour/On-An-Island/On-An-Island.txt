Remember that night
White stairs in the moonlight

They walked here, too
Through empty playground
This ghosts town

Children again on rusty swings
Getting higher

Sharing a dream
On an island
It felt right

We lay side by side
Between the moon and the tide
Mapping the stars for awhile

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow, let it go
Feel the warmth beside you

(1st solo)

Remember that night
The warmth and the laughter
Candles burn
Though the church was deserted

At dawn we went down
Through empty streets to the harbor
Dreamers may leave
But they're here ever after

Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da)
Da, da, da, da, da, da

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow, let it go
Feel the warmth beside you...

(2nd solo to fade)
