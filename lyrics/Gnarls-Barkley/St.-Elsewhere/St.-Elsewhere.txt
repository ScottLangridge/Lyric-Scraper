St. Elsewhere

I packed a few of my belongings
Left the life that I was living
Just some memories of it
Mostly the ones I can't forget

Whenever you need me I'll be here
Until then my dear
I'm going, I'm going, going there

Don't ask me to make time
To travel back and forth
Let nature take it's course
Maybe I'm open from all this ocean air

And if it weren't for you I'd be without
A care setting sail to St. Elsewhere

Anywhere you sit you can see the sun
Unfortunately on this island I'm the only one

And same rules apply on a rainy day
Then it's not such a pretty place to be
It just rains and rains and rains on me

Send a simple sign I can understand
Then a flower grew out that sand
Before you know it I was back out on that sea
Now I don't mind it so much because it's normal
I'm not there, anywhere, St. Elsewhere

Way over yonder there's a new frontier
Would it be so hard for you
To come and visit me here?
I understand
Well just send me a message in a bottle then baby
