Storm Coming - Gnarls Barkley

I could paint a picture with a pen,
But a song will only scratch the skin.
And there are still places I haven't been,
Because I know what's in there, it's already in the air.

There's a storm on the way.
There's a storm on the way.
Alright.
There's a storm on the way.
Uh huh.
And it's coming no matter what I say.

Here I come, I come, I come, I come.

Hey hey hey!
There's truth in the thunder,
Love in the lightning,
The feeling is frightening
And isn't it exciting?
I'm something like stormy weather,
If I weren't we'd never,
Huddle together.

Do I have to tell you,
That I'm also the sunlight,
That shines shortly after.
I just pray cause I have to.
On to a new chapter.
I wish you lots of laughter.
Till the next time you see me
Just remember you need me.
I'm the storm coming.

Here I come, I come, I come, I come.
Here I come, I come, I come, I come.

Run towards the hills to avoid the high flood.
I can do a dance that will make the sky cry blood.
Skills provoking
Seals will be broken open.
All that's left to do is try my love.

I'm singing the cyclone.
I'm writing a raging sea.
Searching for a sign of the times.
It's insane to say it's me.
Listen to our lives.
The wind will whisper the way it is.
I'm going to heaven, what a lovely day it is

Don't ask why, just live and die.
