What did you do? What did you say?
Did you walk or did you run away?
Where are you now? Where have you been?
Did you go alone or did you bring a friend?
I need to know this 'cause I noticed you're smilin'
Out in the sun, havin' fun and feelin' free
And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smilin' for me (I'm very proud at you, I'm very proud at you)
What went right? What went wrong?
Was it the story or was it the song?
Was it overnight or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made you strong?
Or all the above, oh how I love to see you smilin'
And oh yeah take a little pain just in case (Take it just in case)
You need something warm to embrace to help you put on a smilin' face
(I'm very proud at you, I'm very proud at you)
Hey, put on a smilin' face
Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about
Say for instance, my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time (Oh see me)

I want to be you whenever I see you smilin', 'cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
(Hardest things to do)
Your worries and fears become your friends and they end up smilin' at you
Put on a smilin' face
