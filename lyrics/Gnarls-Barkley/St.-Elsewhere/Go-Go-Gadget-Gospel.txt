Pump up the peculiar while I yell, "Unique"
Let me show you right here
I'm wondering what you look like, look at me
Let me show you how to do it

I'm well on my way
I'm almost everything
And this is my day
Make me wanna sing
I'm free, look at me
And all and everything
I'm allowed to see
Free, come and see
Look at me
I'm shapeless, I'm formless
My heart is enormous
I've born this, I've worn this
No never what the norm is
Come here, this is fearless
Contrast in colour
Wisdom's a woman
Listen and love her
I'm free, look at me
Freedom in Hi-Fidelity
Free, come and see
Look at me
What are you waiting on?
I want action, passion, smiling
Laughing, yielding, feeling, helping, healing
Introduce your neighbour to your saviour
I'm free, look at me
Freedom in Hi-Fidelity
Free
