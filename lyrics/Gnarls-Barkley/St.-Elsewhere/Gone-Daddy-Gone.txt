Beautiful girl, lovely dress,
High school smiles, oh yes,
Beautiful girl, lovely dress,
Where she is now I can only guess.

'cause it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
It's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone away.

When I see you,
Eyes will turn blue,
When I see you,
A thousand eyes turning blue.

'cause it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
It's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone away.

I can tell by the way that you,
Switch your walking,
And I can see by the way,
That you baby talk.
And I can know by the way that you,
Treat your man.
I can love you baby, 'til it's a crime!

Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
It's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone away.

Beautiful girl, lovely dress, (it's gone daddy gone)
Fifteen smiles, oh yes, (it's gone daddy gone)
Beautiful girl, lovely dress, (it's gone daddy gone)
Where she is now I can only guess.

'cause it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
It's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone.
Yeah it's gone daddy gone,
The love is gone away.

Going away... Going away... Going away... Going away... Going away... Going away.
