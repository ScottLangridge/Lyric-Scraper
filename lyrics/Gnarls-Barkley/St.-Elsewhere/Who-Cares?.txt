Basically I'm complicated.
I have a hard time taking the easy way.
I wouldn't call it schizophrenia.
But I'll be at least 2 people today.

If that's ok

And I can go on and on and on... But who cares?

It's deep how you can be so shallow.
And I'm afraid 'cause I have no fear.
And I didn't believe in magic.
Until I watched you disappear.

I wish you where here

And I can go on and on and on... But who cares?

You see, everybody is somebody.
But nobody wants to be themselves.
And If I ever wanted to understand me
I'll have to talk to someone else.

'cause every little bit helps.

And I can go on and on and on... But who cares?

Feels like... The surreal life.
But it's still nice.
Wish I could live twice,
And I still might,
If these wounds heal right.
I see a little light,
Even though it's still night.
