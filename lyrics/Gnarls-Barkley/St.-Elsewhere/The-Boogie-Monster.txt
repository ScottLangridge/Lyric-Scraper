Dracula was the name and the boogie man is my thing
I've got a monster in my closet
Someone's underneath my bed
The wind's knocking at my window
I'd kill it but it's already dead
It waits 'till the midnight hour to come to torture me for the wrong I've done
It just sits there and stares at me and it won't let me get any sleep (Just let me sleep)
I've got a monster in my closet
Someone's underneath my bed
The wind's knocking at my window
I'd kill it but it's already dead
At first I was scared when I looked at his eyes but now that I know him, I'm not that surprised
I'm just waiting on the sun to rise
Oh how I wish that old sun would rise
I've got a monster in my closet
Someone's underneath my bed
The wind's knocking at my window
I'd kill it but it's already dead
I used to wonder why he looked familiar
Then I realized it was a mirror
And now it is plain to see
The whole time the monster was me
Oh there's a monster in my closet
Someone's underneath my bed
The wind's knocking at my window
I'd kill it but it's already dead

The living dead, only thing that could bring it back alive, woman, is some good, good head
