In this house the decor is obvious obscure.
It's clearly the theory of less is more.
A plant, a pet, and books on the shelf.
And a frame on the wall where you can
Picture yourself.
And you're welcome to stay.
But even your company must complement
The Feng Shui.
Even down to what I have on.
They do wonder to what extents I have gone.
Tailored and tapered couture to the curb.
Demanding the attention that it does deserve.
Fabrics for the forecast of the day.
I admit it.
Everything is fitted to fall in Feng Shui.
More importantly the way that I move.
If I'm in your town, my needles down,
On the groove.
On site they know my song.
It ain't slow and it sho' ain't long.
You see I do not play.
Forgive me Father, I was forced, out of Feng Shui.
A flow as subtle as a summer breeze.
Like the whispering winds and the talking trees.
To big to be boxed in, it bobs and weaves.
It evolves, it solves, it gives and recieves.
And everything I say is calculated appropriated, written and arranged, in Feng Shui!
