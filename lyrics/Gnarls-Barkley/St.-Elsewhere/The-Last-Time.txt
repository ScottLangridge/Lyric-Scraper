All work and no play .
That's the way it is, ain't it?
There's a rhythm deep inside of you.
And you must get reaquainted (ooh).

Hook
When was the last time you danced?
When was the last time you danced?

Well come rock with me baby.
Dance with me darlin'.
Step with me sweetheart.
The world is watching.

Under an endless sky.
Wish I could fly away forever (and ever).
And the poetry is so pure
When we are on the floor together (It's been a long time, remember?).

Repeat hook.

Don't deny me any further.
Let me have my way.
Ohhh, come closer, yeah.
Let's dance the night away.

Come rock with me baby.
Dance with me darlin'.
Step with me sweetheart.
The world is watching.
