This could be one of those days
That we must go our separate ways.
Scared for you to be out of my sight,
Because you never know, you might.

And I carry this, it's heavy.
And I miss you already...

You were perfect babe.

My time will come yours too.
I'll gladly go before you.

I hope you live forever,
Or maybe we can go together.

It would be perfect baby.

And I carry this, it's heavy.
And I miss you already...
