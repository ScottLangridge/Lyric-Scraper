She has never seen the sunshine,
Yet she's getting along just fine.
She's not staying, she's just passing through.
Hey, do you mind if I follow you?
You.

I love Mary.
Blind Mary, marry me.
I love Mary.
Yeaaaah.

I heard a horse say catch me if you can.
Before you know it I was holding her hand.
It's harder to imagine then understand
How she knows exactly who I am.
Yeah.

I love Mary.
Blind Mary, marry me.
I love Mary.
Yeah.

She's my friend, she doesn't judge me.
She has no idea I'm ugly.
So I've absolutely nothing to hide.
Because I'm so much prettier inside.
Yeah.

I love Mary.
Blind Mary, marry me.
I love Mary.
Blind Mary follow me.
