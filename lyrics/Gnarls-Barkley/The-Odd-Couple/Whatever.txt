[Cee-Lo]
I don't have any friends at all
Cause I have nothin in common with y'all
So who's gonna catch me if I fall?
My back's always against the wall
I don't have anything to say
I want everything to go my way
Shut up mom! It is not okay
I'm alone almost every day

[Chorus:]
But it's cool (it's cool)
It could be better (could be better)
I don't care... (I don't care)
Whatever (whatever) Hold up my man
La la la la lah-lah-lah, whatever [3X]
La la la la lah-lah-lah

[Cee-Lo]
Talk to my counselor 'bout how I feel
Everyone agrees I could use some help
I love my girl more, than I love myself
But she's goin steady with someone else
I don't know what else to do
Said fuck me? Well fuck you too!
I know it sounds real sad but true
Bein alone is nothin new

[Chorus:]
But it's cool (it's cool)
It could be better (could be better)
I don't care... (I don't care)
Whatever (whatever) Whatever bitch!
La la la la lah-lah-lah, whatever [3X]
La la la la lah-lah-lah
