Up, up
And away she goes
Now I know
That I know she knows
Could one live a lie?
Well neither will I
If she still try to try
But remarkably, my son
All my work is done
Wouldn't surprise me
To see her ghost
She would like me
To know she knows
And I'm almost sure
I was absolutely
Nothing before
Now I'm so
So much more

The one word
That describes the past
I'm pretty
Much possessed
We are the reason
I suppose
And we've spoken
So I know she knows
There was one
To sacrifice
When you live
More than twice
Or when I bet it's nice
Gonna be just like you
I'm giving my life, too
No other woman
Would wear your clothes
And it goes
Without saying she knows
She knows
