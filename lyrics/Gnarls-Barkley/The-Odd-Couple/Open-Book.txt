Eyes fill with fire
Wish I was a better liar
It hurts
When it's happening
And so I cry

The winter is here
And colder
I guess
That I could have
Told ya
That I am
Safe and warm
From the hell inside

Karma (karma)
Take me (take me)
Karma (karma)
Break me
I am
An open book (ooo)

The drumbeat of my heart
Is tribal
Oh the sweet sound
Of survival
Shouts serenade
This voice forevermore

The sun would have
To be frozen
For anything
Out there opposing
Got to be left
In it's own blood
On the jungle floor

(War)

Karma (karma)
Break me
Karma (karma)
Shake me
I am an open book (ooo)
An open book

Wwhen I sing
A song of peace
It soothes
The savage beast
Even it understands
That I understand
At least

So you mortals
Must keep this in mind
This is the way
I'm designed
And I have no power
So i'll only die one time

Karma (karma)
Kill me
You have (karma)
To kill me
I am
An open book (ooo)
An open book

Karma
Karma-aaaaa-oooo
