Now I can sing you the storyline
And If you like my story fine
But ain' t none of the glory mine
See my life was a lonely one
And I was dear mama' s only son
With no idea what I' m gon' become
And I didn' t have long to know
That you don' t have to be grown to go
I could have died so long before
Then I finally saw the sign
And I made it on down the line
One step at a time

I feel better
I can smile at it now, I feel better
Oooh better
And even a little is still better
Oh have mercy on me

Ooh it' s probably plain to see
That I got a whole lotta pain in me
And it will always remain in me
So cold it' s a crying shame
Yea here I am trying again
Cuz I refuse to die in pain
The circumstances put soul in me
And there ain' t no holding me
I have a heart made of gold in me
Can you believe this is where I' ve been
And when adversity comes again
I' ll deal with it then

I feel better
I can laugh at it now, I feel better
Oooh better
And even a little is still better
Oh have mercy on me

I say everythings fine, You can take your time
With what be on your mind, If  you knew you was dying
I would wanna just feel this one more time
I say everythings fine, Take your time
With what be on your mind, If you knew you was dying
I would wanna just feel this one more time yea

(I wanna thank...)
