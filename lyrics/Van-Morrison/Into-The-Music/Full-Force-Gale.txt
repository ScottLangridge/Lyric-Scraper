Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again
I was lifted up again by the lord

And no matter where I roam
I will find my way back home
I will always return to the lord

In the gentle evening breeze
By the whispering shady trees
I will find my sanctuary in the lord

I was headed for a fall
The I looked up and saw the writing on the wall

Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again
I was lifted up again by the lord

I was headed for a fall
The I looked up and saw the writing on the wall

In the gentle evening breeze
By the whispering shady trees
I will find my sanctuary in the lord

And no matter where I roam
I will find my way back home
I will always return to the lord

Like a full force gale
I was lifted up again
I was lifted up again by the lord
