Put on your lipstick
Apply your makeup
Sometimes youre living in a dream
And then you go steppin out queen

Well you go to a party
And you laugh loud and hearty
You stay all night you know you make the scene
As you go steppin out queen

Its just a windfall away
Its a love keeps getting stronger every day
You gotta look up and say
Its just a windfall away

Its just a windfall away
It keeps getting stronger every day
You gotta look out and say
Its just a windfall away

Well you go through the drama
And you work in the dharma
Then you stand up and wipe your mirror clean
And then you go steppin out queen

Come in the garden and just look at the flowers
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
Its just a windfall away
Its a love its a love keeps getting stronger every day
Ill come in your garden and then well go steppin out
