Among the rolling hills Ill live my life in him
Oh I will live my life in him among the rolling hills

With my wife and child Ill do no man no ill
Oh I will do no man no ill among the rolling hills

Among the rolling hills Ill read my Bible still
Oh I will read my Bible still among the rolling hills

With my pen Ill write my song among the rolling hills
With my pen Ill write my song among the rolling hills

I will do my jig among the rolling hills
Oh I will do my jig and live among the rolling hills

With my pen Ill write my song among the rolling hills
Ill take out my pen and write my song among the rolling hills

And Ill stand and watch it all among the rolling hills
Oh I will stand and watch it all among the rolling hills
