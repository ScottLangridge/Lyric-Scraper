Many a tear has to fall
But its all in the game

All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You had words with him
And your futures looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above

Once in a while he wont call
But its all in the game

Soon hell be there by your side
With a small bouquet

And hell kiss your lips
And caress your fingertips
And your heart will fly away

You had words with him
And your futures looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above

Once in a while he wont call
But its all in the game

Soon hell be there by your side
With a small bouquet

And hell kiss your lips
And caress your fingertips
And your heart will fly away
