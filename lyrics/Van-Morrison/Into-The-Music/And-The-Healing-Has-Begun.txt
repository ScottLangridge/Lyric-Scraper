And well walk down the avenue again
And well sing all the songs from way back when
And well walk down the avenue again and the healing has begun

And well walk down the avenue in style
And well walk down the avenue and well smile
And well say baby aint it all worthwhile when the healing has begun

I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes, yes, yes when the healing has begun

When you hear the music ringin in your soul
And you feel it in your heart and it grows and grows
And it comes from the backstreet rock & roll and the healing has begun
I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes, yes, yes and the healing has begun

Were gonna make music underneath the stars
Were gonna play to the violin and the two guitars
Were gonna sit there and play for hours and hours when the healing has begun

Spoken: wait a minute, listen, listen,
I didn't know you stayed up so late.
I just got home from a gig and I saw
You standing on the street.
Just let me move on up to this window-sill a lot yeah, I got some sherry.
You want a drop of port.
Lets move behind this door here.
Lets move on up behind this letter-box behind this door.
Lets go in your front room,
Lets play this muddy waters record you got there,
If you just open up a little bit
And let me ease on in this backstreet jellyroll....

Were gonna stay out all night long
And then were gonna go out and roam across the field
Baby you know how I feel when the healing has begun

When the healing, when the healing
Were gonna stay out all night long
Were gonna dance to the rock & roll
When the healing when the healing has begun
Baby just let me ease on a little bit, dig this backstreet jellyroll
