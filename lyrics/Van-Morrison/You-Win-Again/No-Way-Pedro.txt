No way pedro, no way jose
I just wanna know, are you goin my way?
Oh, I saw you standin by the borderline
You can never make up your mind

No way cisco, no way pancho
Why don't you meet me, back at the rancho?
Well, if you get there, please don't be late
How can I get you now, if I hesitate?

No way kemosabe, no way tonto
Come here quick, ya gotta make it pronto
Well, when you head them, off at the pass
Baby, I just want a love to last

No way pedro, no way jose
Just wanna know, are you goin my way?
Oh, I saw you standin, by the borderline
I just want you to make up, your goddamned mind

Youll never make up your mind

Well, youll never make up your mind
