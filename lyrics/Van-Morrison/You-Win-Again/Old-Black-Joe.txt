Gone are the days
When my heart was young and gay
Gone are toils
Of the cotton fields away
Gone to the fields
Of a better land, I know
I hear those gentle voices callin me
Old black joe

I'm comin, I'm comin
Though my head is bendin low
I hear those gentle voices calling
Old black joe

I'm comin home (I'm comin home)
Well, I'm comin home (I'm comin home)
Though my head (my head, my head is bendin low)
I hear those gentle voices calling
Old black joe

Gone are the days
When my heart was young and gay
Gone are the toils of the cotton fields, away
Gone to the fields of a better land I know
I hear those gentle voices calling
Old black joe

I'm comin home (I'm comin home)
Oh, an I'm comin home (I'm comin home)
Well oh well, my head (my head) is bendin low
I hear those gentle voices calling
Old black joe

I'm comin home (I'm comin home)
Oh, an I'm comin home (I'm comin home)
Can ya see my head (my head) is bendin low
I hear those gentle voices calling
Old black joe

Old black joe

Old black joe
