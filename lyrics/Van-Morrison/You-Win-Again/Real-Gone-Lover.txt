I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
And if ya love me one time
Youll soon come back for more

Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play
Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play
Like the old saying goes
When sunshines, lets make hay

Well, I'm a nervous fella (hes a nervous fella)
I'm a nervous fella (hes a nervous fella)
I'm a little-little nervous fella
(hes a nervous fella)
I'm a little-little nervous fella

Don't make me wait all night

I'm a real gone lover
I'm hip, I'm in the know
(sing it with me)
I'm a real gone lover

And if ya love me one time
Youll soon come back for more

Come over to my pad
Come over to my pad and play

Like the old saying goes
When the sun shines, lets make hay, ha

I'm a nervous fella (I'm a real gone lover)
