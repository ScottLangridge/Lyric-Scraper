We talked about the birdies
That fly up in the trees
We talked about the moon
And the stars we couldn't see
But you keep on pretending
You don't know whats wrong with me

Come on, lets talk, about us

We talked about the good times
That made us laugh and sigh
We talked about the bad times
That brought tears to our eyes
Now, I think its about time
For you to realize

Come on, lets talk, about us

(hey)
Dear, I swear Ill love you, til the very end
But I don't plan on stickin around
If its just to be your friend

Weve talked, an talked, an talked, an talked
But theres been nothin said
The things that youve been talkin about
Just don't stick to my head

Sometimes I think, little girl
That your heart is filled with lead

Come on, lets talk, about us

Well, dear I swear Ill love you
Oh, til the very end
Well, I don't plan on stickin around
If its just to be your friend

Weve talked, an talked, an talked, an talked
And theres been nothin said
The thing that youve been talkin about
Just don't stick to my head
My darlin little girl
I think that your heart is made of lead

Come on, lets talk, about us

Come on, lets talk, about us

Well, well, well, well, well

Come on, lets talk, about us
