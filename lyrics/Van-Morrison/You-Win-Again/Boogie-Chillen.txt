Spoken:
When I first came to town, people
I was walking down hasting street
Everybody was talkin about, henry swing club
I decided to stop in there for awhile
And man, when I got there
Yeah, they were really havin a ball

Sings:
Well, I feel so good
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Well, to the break of day
(say, it again)

Well, I feel so good
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Well, to the break of day
(alright)

When I was a young boy
I was layin down one night
And I heard ma and pa talkin
I heard pa tell ma
Hey, come on, let that boy boogie-woogie
cause you know its in him
And its just got to come out
cause its in him
And its just got to come out

Well, feels so good, child
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Lord, til the break-a day
(chillen, Im chillen here)

Well, feels so good, now lord
I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie, I wanna boogie
Yeah-ow, til the break of day
