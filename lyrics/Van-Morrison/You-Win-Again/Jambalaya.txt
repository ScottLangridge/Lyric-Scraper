Goodbye joe, me gotta go down the bayou
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My yvonne, sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou

Well, jambalaya an a crawfish pie an a file gumbo
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar an be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux, fontaineaux, the place is buzzin
Hey, an the kinfolk come to see yvonne by the dozen
Well, and-a dress in style, go hog wild an be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have big fun on the bayou

Well, jambalaya an a crawfish pie, an a file gumbo
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Well a pick guitar, fill fruit jar an be gay-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have a big fun on the bayou

Wanna settle down, far from town, get me a pirogue
Gonna catch all the fish in the bayou
Gonna swap my mon, to buy yvonne, what she need-o
Son of a gun, we gonna have a big fun on the bayou

Well, jambalaya, an a crawfish pie, an a file gumbo
Cause, tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar an be gay-o
Son of a gun, were gonna have big fun on the bayou
