(Van Morrison)
I'm stranded at the edge of the world
It's a world I don't know
Got no where to go
Feels like I'm stranded
And I'm stranded between that ol' devil and the deep blue sea
And nobody's gonna tell me, tell me what, what time it is
Everyday, everyday, it's hustle, hustle time, hustle time
Everyday and every way, one more, one more mountain to climb
It's leaving me stranded
In my own little island
With my eyes open wide
But I'm feeling stranded
Every, every, everyday, it's hustle time
Every way, one more mountain to climb
I'm stranded between the devil and the deep blue sea
There ain't no where else to be
