(Van Morrison)
You gotta fight every day to keep mediocrity at bay
Gotta fight every day to keep mediocrity at bay
Got to fight with all your might not to get in the bleeding heart's way
You gotta fight for your rights, you can't bury your head in the sand
You gotta fight for your rights, you can't just bury your head in the sand
Politics and religion, superstition go hand in hand
Well you're going through the motions and they can't hear a word you say
Well you're going through the motions, they don't want to hear a word you say
Got to keep boredom at bay and keep mediocrity away
Gotta fight every day to keep mediocrity at bay
Gotta fight every day to keep mediocrity at bay
Got to fight with all your might not to get in the bleeding heart's way
