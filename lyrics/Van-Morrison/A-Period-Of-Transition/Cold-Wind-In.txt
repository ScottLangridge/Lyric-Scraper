I waited for you
You waited for me
That it seemed like, seemed like a mighty long time

Baby I had to have you
Oh, I had to have you
Come rain, rain or shine

It was a cold wind in august
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin in your garden
In the california pine

I was standing shivering
I've got the fever in the rain
But I can't come on back to see you
Again and again and again

I said I, I had to have you
Baby I had to have you
Come rain, come rain or shine

It was a cold wind in august
Shivers up and down my spine
And I was standing in your garden

In the california pine
California pine

(instrumental)

It was a cold wind in august
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin in your garden
In the california pine
In the california pine it was a cold wind in august
I was pushed on through september
Oh pushin through september
In the rain
Pushin through, pushin through september
In the rain

Ooh
It was a cold wind in august
Shivers up and down my spine
I was standin standin in your garden
In the california pine
