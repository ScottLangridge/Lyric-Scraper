How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet again

Oh! - I think you know it well
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Hey! - I think you know it well
Whenever we meet again

Just let it in and let it out, ba da da da da de da de da
Then you begin to know without a doubt
That grace will follow us
Wherever we go, wherever we go
That grace will follow us
Whenever we meet again

Just let it in and let it out, ba da da da da de da de da
Then you begin to know without a doubt
That grace will follow us
Wherever we go, wherever we go
That grace will follow us
Whenever we meet again

How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
How sweet that joyous sound
Whenever we meet again

Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
Whenever we meet, whenever we meet
Whenever we meet again
