Soul is a feeling, feeling deep within
Soul is not the color of your skin
Soul is the essence, essence from within
It is where everything begins

Soul is what youve been through
Whats true for you
Where you going to
What youre gonna do

Soul is your station for the folk of your nation
Something that you wear with pride
Soul can be your vision or something that is hidden
Its not something that you gotta hide

Soul is what youve been through
And whats true for you
Where you going to
What youre gonna do

Soul can be your station for the folk of your nation
Something that you wear with pride
Soul can be your vision, it can be your religion
Something that you just cant hide

Oh, soul is a feeling, feeling deep within
Soul is not the color of your skin
Soul is the essence, essence from within
Soul is where everything begins
