People come and people go
One monkey dont stop no show
Im getting too tired to start all over again
'Cause it aint gonna change no thing

Theres just all of this here land
Been trampled on by man
And all around me, all these birds of prey
And all Im trying to do is just get by one more day

Only a fool would ever think
Things could ever be the same
Only a fool would surmise
Everyone is sane

Though I watch them come and go
Im fed up with the status quo
And Im feeling too tired to start all over again
'Cause I know that it aint gonna change no thing

Only a fool could think
That things would ever be simple again
Only a fool would surmise
Everyone is the same

Oh, I watch them come and go
I dont have time for the status quo
I say, blessed be and Im on my way, on my way
'Cause it aint gonna change no thing
No, no, no, no, no, no

Well, it aint gonna change no thing
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, it aint gonna change no thing
