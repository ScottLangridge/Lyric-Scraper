Mocked me when I was singing the songs
Trying to get back to something more simple than we have
They mocked me cause I told it like it was

Wrote about disappointment and greed
Wrote about what we really didnt need in our lives
Make us feel alive and whole

Illusions and pipe dreams on the one hand
And straight reality is always cold
Saying something hard edged is off the wall
And it might seem too bold

Mocked me when it got out of hand
Nobody tried to understand
Now we got to keep it simple and thats that

Illusions and pipe dreams on the one hand
And straight reality is always cold
Saying something hard edged is off the wall
And it just might be too bold

Well, Im down here on the running board
Where Ive been many times before
But we got to keep it simple to save ourselves

Mocked me when I tried to get back
Said the train was completely off the track
And we got to get back to something simple to save ourselves

Whoa, we got to get back to something simple
Just to save yourselves
Well, got to get back to something simple
Just to save yourselves

Well, you got to keep it simple
Keep it simple just to
And thats that

Whoa, you got to keep it simple nowadays
And thats just that
Whoa, whoa, you got to keep it simple nowadays
And thats just the way it is

And you got to keep it simple these days
Cause thats the way it is
Well, you got to keep it, keep it simple
And thats that
