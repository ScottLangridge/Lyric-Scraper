I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Tell me whos gonna patronize me now?
They've brainwashed the suckers again
And perpetrated the myth, propaganda far and wide

No wavelength, no mileage
No current, currency
No answers, just silence
And nothing is what its supposed to be

I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Tell me whos gonna patronize me now?
I got shipwrecked and got stranded on the rocks
Everybody left me high and dry

I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Whos gonna patronize me now?
Brainwashed the suckers again
And perpetrated the myth, propaganda far and wide

No wavelength, no mileage
Theres no current, currency
No answers, only silence
Nothing looks like its meant to be

I was educated by the school of hard knocks
Whos gonna patronize me now?
Just got shipwrecked and stranded on the rocks
And it left me high and dry

And it's left me sitting high and dry
And it left me sitting high and dry
And it left me sitting high and dry
