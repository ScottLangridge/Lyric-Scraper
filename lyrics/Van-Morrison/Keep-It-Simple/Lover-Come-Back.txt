The sound of the evening breeze
Is calling you back to me
The sun behind the clouds
Reminds me that youre not around

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart

The sound of the roar of the waves
The misty evening haze
Playing that sad refrain
Going through it all over again

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart

Since you went away
Im a lonely, lonely, lonely one
Come on back to stay
You are the only one

The clickety clack of the train
Is easing all of my pain
Im seeing it all too plain
Im calling you home again

Lover come back to my heart
Lover come back to my arms

Since you went away
Oh Lord, and Im a lonely one
Come on back to stay
You be my only one

The clickety clack of the train
Is making it all so plain
Is easing some of my pain
And Im calling you home again

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back
Lover come back to my heart
Lover come back

Lover come back to my heart
Love come back
Lover come back to my heart

Lover come back to my arms
Lover come back to my heart
