Id love to write another song
But nothing seems to come
Id love to write another song
To carry me along
Make some money, pay the bills
Keep me busy too
Id love to write another love song

Id love to write another song
Im searching everywhere
Though I look for inspiration sometimes
Its just not there
I have to work, I have to play
I have to get in step
If I could write another love song
I know it sure would help

Id love to write another song
Baby especially for you
Id love to write another song
And feel things bright and new
In poetry Id carve it well
Id even make it rhyme
Id love to write another song
Just to get some peace of mind

Id love to write another song
To get some peace of mind

Id love to write another song
Baby for some peace of mind.
