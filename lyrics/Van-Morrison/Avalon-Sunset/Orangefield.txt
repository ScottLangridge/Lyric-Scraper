On a gold autumn day
You came my way in orangefield
Saw you standing by the riverside in orangefield
How I love you then in orangefield
Like I love you now in orangefield

And the sun shone on your hair
When I saw you there in orangefield
Saw you standing by the riverside in orangefield
How I loved you then in orangefield
Like I love you now in orangefield

And the sun shone so bright
And it lit up all our days
You were the apple of my eye
Baby its true

On a golden autumn day
All my dreams came true in orangefield
On a throne of ulster day
You came my way in orangefield
How I loved you then in orangefield
Like I love you now in orangefield

And the sun shone so bright
And it lit up all our lives
And the apple of my eye
Baby was you

On a throne of ulster day
You came my way in orangefield
Saw you standing by the riverside in orangefield
How I loved you then in orangefield
Like I love you now in orangefield
How I loved you then in orangefield
Like I love you now in orangefield.
