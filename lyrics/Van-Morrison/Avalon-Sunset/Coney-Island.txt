Coming down from downpatrick
Stopping off at st. Johns point
Out all day birdwatching
And the craic was good
Stopped off at strangford lough
Early in the morning
Drove through shrigley taking pictures
And on to killyleagh
Stopped off for sunday papers at the
Lecale district, just before coney island

On and on, over the hill to ardglass
In the jamjar, autumn sunshine, magnificent
And all shining through

Stop off at ardglass for a couple of jars of
Mussels and some potted herrings in case
We get famished before dinner

On and on, over the hill and the craic is good
Heading towards coney island

I look at the side of your face as the sunlight comes
Streaming through the window in the autumn sunshine
And all the time going to coney island I'm thinking,
Wouldnt it be great if it was like this all the time.
