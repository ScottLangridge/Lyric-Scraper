Chop that wood
Carry water
Whats the sound of one hand clapping
Enlightenment, don't know what it is

Every second, every minute
It keeps changing to something different
Enlightenment, don't know what it is
Enlightenment, don't know what it is
It says its non attachment
Non attachment. Non attachment

I'm in the here and now, and I'm meditating
And still I'm suffering but that's my problem
Enlightenment, don't know what it is

Wake up

Enlightenment says the world is nothing
Nothing but a dream, everythings an illusion
And nothing is real

Good or bad baby
You can change it anyway you want
You can rearrange it
Enlightenment, don't know what it is
Chop that wood
And carry water
Whats the sound of one hand clapping
Enlightenment, don't know what it is

All around baby. You can see
Youre making your own reality. Everyday because
Enlightenment, don't know what it is

One more time

Enlightenment. Don't know what it is
Its up to you
Enlightenment. Don't know what it is
Its up to you everyday
Enlightenment, don't know what it is
Its always up to you
Enlightenment, don't know what it is
Its up to you, the way you think
