Justin, gentler than a man
I am down on my knees
At the wireless knobs
I am down on my knees
At those wireless knobs
Telefunken, telefunken
And Im searching for
Luxembourg, luxembourg,
Athlone, budapest, afn,
Hilversum, helvetia
In the days before rock n roll

In the days before rock n roll
In the days before rock n roll

When we let, then we bet
On lester piggott when we met
We let the goldfish go

In the days before rock n roll

Fats did not come in
Without those wireless knobs
Fats did not come in
Without those wireless knobs
Elvis did not come in
Without those wireless knobs
Nor fats, nor elvis
Nor sonny, nor lightning
Nor muddy, nor john lee

In the days before rock n roll
In the days before rock n roll

When we let and we bet
On lester piggott 10/1
And we let the goldfish go
Down the stream
Before rock n roll
We went over the wavebands
Wed get luxembourg,
Luxembourg and athlone

Afm stars of jazz
Come in, come in, come in, ray charles
Come in, the high priest

In the days before rock n roll
In the days before rock n roll

When we let and we bet
On lester piggott 10 to 1
And we let the goldfish go
And then the killer came along
The killer, jerry lee lewis
A whole lotta shakin goin on,
Great balls of fire
Little richard

Justin, gentler than a man
Justin, justin, where is justin now?
Whats justin doing now?
Just, where is justin now?
Come aboard
