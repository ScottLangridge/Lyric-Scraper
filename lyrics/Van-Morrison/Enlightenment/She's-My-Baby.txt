Well I'm so blue
I'm thinking about you
I'm feeling so blue
I'm feeling so sad
I just don't understand
I'm feeling so sad
And in the midnight
I don t turn off the light
Until the daylight
Well I toss and I turn
And my heart it still burns
'Til I see her again
She's my lady, she's my baby, she's my lady
She's my baby, she's my lady, she's my haby
She's my lady, now, now, now, now
In the morning I wake
To go get food on my plate
But I just can't eat
And when I go in the cafe
To sit down at my seat
I don't have egg on my face
When it stops and it starts
It just tears me apart
Like a pain in my heart
But it's been misunderstood
Somebody's breaking the rules
And I'm nobody's fool
Well, well, well
She's my lady, she's my baby, she's my lady
She's my baby, she's my lady, she's my baby
She's my lady, now, now, now, now
When it's so high
I can reach for the sky
But when it's so low
I got nowhere to go
When it goes wrong
I just don't belong
When it goes right
It's clean out of sight
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm feeling so glad
I'm on top of the world
When I see you again
Well it's so true
I been thinking about you
Baby you're my flame
When it goes down
Down on the ground
When it goes down
But when it goes up
It just fills up my cup
When it goes up
Well, well, well
She's my lady, she's my baby, she's my lady
She's my baby, she's my lady, she's my baby
She's my lady, now, now, now, now
