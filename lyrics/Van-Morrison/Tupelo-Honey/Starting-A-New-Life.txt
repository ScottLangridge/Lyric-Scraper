When I hear that robin sing
Well I know it's coming on spring
Ooo-we and were starting a new life

I've been shovelling the snow away
Working hard for my pay
All I gotta say is were starting a new life

Were gonna move
Way on down the line
Girl, we been standing in one place for too long a time
When I hear that robin song
Well, I know it wont be long
Frank, I know we belong
And were starting a new life

We gonna move, move way on down the line
Girl, we been standing in one place for too long a time
When I hear that robin song
Well, I know it wont be long
Frank, I know we belong
And were starting a new life
