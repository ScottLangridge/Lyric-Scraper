Oh dont it get you
Get you when youre through
Feel the breezes blowing all around your coat
Oh dont it get you
When you gotta roam
Hear the children singing
daddys coming home

Going down to old old woodstock
Feel the cool night breeze
Going down to old old woodstock
Going down to give my baby a squeeze
Going down to old old woodstock
Feel the cool night breeze
Going down to old old woodstock
Way behind the shady trees

Here I come a swaggering
Way on over the ridge
See the water flowing way beneath the bridge
And my womans waiting
By the kitchen door
Im driving along
In my old beat up car

Going down to old old woodstock
Feel the cool night breeze
Going down to old old woodstock
Give my child a squeeze
Going down to old old woodstock
To feel the cool night breeze
Going down to old old woodstock
Way behind the shady trees

Listen, oh dont it get you
Get you in your throat
Feel the breezes blowing
All around your coat
Lord dont it get you
When youre bound to roam
Hear your children sing
daddys coming home

Going down to old old woodstock
To feel the cool night breeze
Give my child a squeeze
Going down to old old woodstock
To feel the cool night breeze
Going down to old old woodstock
Way behind the shady trees
Going down to old old woodstock.....
