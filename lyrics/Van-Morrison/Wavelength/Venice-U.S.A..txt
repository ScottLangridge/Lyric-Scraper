Found myself, found myself, oh, in a restaurant in Venice
Found myself, oh, in a restaurant in Venice
I was talkin' to my baby, in a restaurant down in Venice

When I found myself down in Venice and I'm cryin'
But my tears, but my tears are filled with joy
And I'm walkin' in Venice and I'm cryin'

Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah

Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah

As I'm leaving Venice, as I'm leaving Venice
As I'm leaving Venice, all the streets are wet with rain
And in my memory and in my memory
And in my memory, I remember it well

And I take a stroll, oh, see the ships come sailing in
In the harbor, in the harbor down in Venice

And I'm cryin'
But my tears, but my tears are filled with joy
And I'm walkin' in Venice and I'm cryin'

Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah

Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah

Walkin' in Venice and I'm cryin'
Oh, as I'm walkin' in Venice, walkin' in Venice
And I'm cryin', well, I'm walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk walk, walk, walkin' in Venice

Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I walk and I walk
And I walk and I walk, well, I'm walkin' in Venice
I walk and I walk and I walk and I feel you
And I see you as I'm walkin' down in Venice
Now sing a song, goes like this

Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah

Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
Dum, derra, dum, dum, diddy, diddy, dah, dah
