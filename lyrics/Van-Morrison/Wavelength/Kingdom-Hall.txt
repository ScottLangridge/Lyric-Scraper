So glad to see you
So glad youre here
Come here beside me now
We can clear inhibition away
All inhibitions
Throw them away
And when we dance like this
Like weve never been dancin before

Chorus:
Oh, they were swingin
Down at kingdom hall
Oh, bells were ringin
Down at the kingdom hall
A choir was singin
Down at the kingdom hall
Hey, liley, liley, liley
Hey, liley, liley, low
Do do do do do do, do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do, do
Do do do do do do

Good body music
Brings you right here
Free flowin motion now
When were shakin it out on the floor
Good rockin music
Down in your shoes
And when we dance like this
Like weve never been dancin before

Repeat chorus

Down at the kingdom hall
They were havin a party
They were havin a ball
Bells were ringing out
And the choir was singin
Hey, liley, liley, liley
Hey, liley, liley, low
Do do, do do, do do, do do
Sugar was there
Did you see sugar
Down at the kingdom hall
Sugar was tough
