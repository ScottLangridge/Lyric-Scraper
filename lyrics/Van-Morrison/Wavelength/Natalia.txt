I'm walkin down the street
I'm on that midnight beat
I'm on a lonely avenue
Baby, wont you walk with me
Baby, wont you talk with me
Oh that's all I want you to do, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
Call your name out

Chorus:
Na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na, natalia
Here on a summer night
I wanna kiss and hold you tight
Just the way we used to do
Walkin down the same old street
People that we used to meet
Such a long, long time ago, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
And I call out your name

Repeat chorus two times

On a magic night like this
I hunger for your kiss
On a magic night like this

Repeat chorus

Walk with me
Talk with me
Walk with me
Talk with me
Natalia, natalia, natalia
Natalia, natalia, natalia

Fade
