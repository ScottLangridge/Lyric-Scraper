The wine beneath the bed,
The things weve done and said
And all the memories that come glancing back to me
In my loneliness
Youre standing in the breach
Beyond that stretch, but our love will reach
Unconsciousness that find me sometimes wondering
Where youre at.
Hmm, take me back again,
Take me back one more time, spanish rose.

The way you pulled the gate
Behind you when you said, it aint too late,
Come on, lets have a ball
And swing the town tonight.
And hoping youd come through
And many others, too,
And all the friends we used to have in days gone by,
I'm wondering
If youll take me back again,
Take me back one more time, spanish rose.

And when the lights went out
And no one was abandoning the country in full bloom,
In the room we danced
And many hearts were torn
And when the word went around that everything was wrong
And couldn't be put right
It tore me up, it tore me up.

In slumber you did sleep,
The window I did creep
And touch your raven hair and sing that song
Again to you.
You did not even wince,
You thought I was the prince
To come and take you from your misery
And lonely castle walls.
Ah, take me back again,
Take me back one more time, spanish rose.

(fadeout)
Ah ah, ah ah,
Mmmj, mmm,
Da da da di da da da...
