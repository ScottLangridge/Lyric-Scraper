Who drove the red sports car from the mansion
And laid upon the grass in summer time
And who done me out high time fashion
And made me read between the lines
And who said follow the man its your only chance
Sit on your throne, you got to make it on your own, on your own

And who said
Look at you, look at you
You got jam on your face and
Who did your homework and read your bible,
And signed your name everyplace and
Who said fortunes untold dont go by gold,
Youre much better known
You got to make it on your own, on your own.

And do you remember, do you remember
I said a long time ago when I came walkin down
I came walkin down
Maggies place
It started comin on rain,
It started comin on rain,
cause I had nothin on but a shirt
And a pair of pants
And I was gettin wet,
And I was gettin wet,
Saturated, saturated
And maggie opened up the window
And jane swung out her right arm,
She said, hi! I said, hi! ya.
Howre your doin baby.
She said, come on in out of the rain
Come on in out of the rain, lord,
Come on in out of the rain.

Sit down by the fireside
Dry yourself,
Do, do it,
I got caught,
I got caught,
In a bag.
