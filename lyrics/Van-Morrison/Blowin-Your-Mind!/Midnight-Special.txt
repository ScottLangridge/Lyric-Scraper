Well you wake up in the mornin'
When the ding-dong ring (ding 'em man, ding 'em)
Go over to the table
See the same old (damn) thing

Nothing put upon the table
And nothin' in my pan
Say anything about it
I get in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on me

If you ever go to houston
Oh well you better walk right
You better not stagger
And you better not fight

Or the sheriff gonna 'rrest you
Lord, and carry you down
And if the jury find you guilty
You're penitentiary bound

But let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on me

Let the midnight special (hoo)
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on me

Yonder comes miss rosie (yeah) (oh yeah)
How in the world do you know? (i be low)
Well i know her by her apron (oh yeah)
And the dress she wore

Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand (yeah)
She's a-gonna tell the captain
You tell him listen man

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on me
(me, me, me)

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Well let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on me

Well i done my time boy (well, yeah)
Who they caught with a crime
Well the man ain't call me
He done be ridin' down the line

But let the midnight special
Shine a light on me (yeah)
Let the midnight special
Shine it's ever lovin' light on me
