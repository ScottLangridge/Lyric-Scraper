Little gal, little girl, lord, you know its true,
Little gal, little girl, lord, you know its true,
I don't wanna stop rockin and rollin with you.

Are you gonna let me stand alone?
Are you gonna let me stand alone?
Caught you this morning before your daddy came home.

And I done more for you than your daddy has ever done,
I done more for you than your daddy has ever done,
Gave you my jelly roll and he aint give you none.
Lets go, eric.

Don't you ever go down, down on curzon street, its bad.
Don't you ever go down, down on curzon street.
That's where old john flogs his daily meat.

Maybe sometime he say leave the little boy and the girl behind.
I got messed up round somewhere called notting hill gate,
I lived there for a while, but I moved out and when I moved out I was in such a state,
I've never gone back there,

But I, I'm sure I done more for you than your daddy has ever done, baby,
Made you learn your syllables.
Done more for you than your daddy has ever done, all right, ha ha,
Gave you my jelly roll and he aint give you none.
Stay on the move.

In the back street, in the back street I gave you my jelly roll,
Ah, I gave it to you, ha ha.
Remember when we were down in the, the alley
And I said the lights were out, baby this is it you know, ha ha ha,
All right, we got a good thing going.
You can leave now if you don't like whats happening.
You know we got a... A few things going, you know, ha ha,
Its a drag, ha ha, huh, that's what you call it.
