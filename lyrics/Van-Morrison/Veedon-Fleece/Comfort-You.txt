I wanna comfort you
I wanna comfort you
I wanna comfort you
Just let your tears run wild
Like when you were a child

Ill do what I can do
I wanna comfort you
You put the weight on me
You put the weight on me
You put the weight on me

When it gets too much for me
When it gets too much, much too much for me
Ill do the same thing that you do
And Ill put the weight on you
Huh
Ill put the weight on you
Ill put the weight on you

And Ill do the same thing that you do
Ill put the weight on you
I wanna comfort you
I wanna comfort you

And I wanna comfort you
Just let your tears run wild
Like when you were a child
Ill do what I can do
I just wanna comfort you
