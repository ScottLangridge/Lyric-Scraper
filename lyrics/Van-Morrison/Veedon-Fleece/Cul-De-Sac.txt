In the cul de sac, so smooth
I look down
Be less sure, sir
And take your rest

Its been much too long
Since we drifted in song
Lay it down wet
In this hide-away

Oh I travelled far
To the nearest star
And met palomar, ...mar..., mar...
And we dont care just who you know
Its who you are
And when they all go home
Down the cobblestones
You can double back (spoken this is it)
To a cul de sac
Mmm

Oh, I travelled far
The nearest star
And mount palomar, palomar, palomar, palomar
And we dont care just who dyou know who dyou know
And who you really are, really are

And when they all,
All go home
Down the cobblestones
You will double back
To a cul de sac
You know, you know you will
You will, oh, will double back
And not very far
To a cul de sac
You, you, you... will double back
To a cul de sac
You know, you know its not very far away
No, no
Its just a cul de sac

And you know, and you know, and you know... its not very very far away,
No
Its just a cul de sac
Donn, donn, donn...
Youre not very far away, no ohhh
Its not, its not very far away
Its not as far as a country mile
(you got it)
Its just a cul de sac
