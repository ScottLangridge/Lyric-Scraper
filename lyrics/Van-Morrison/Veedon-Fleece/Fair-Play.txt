Fair play to you
Killarneys lakes are so blue
And the architecture Im taking in with my mind
So fine...

Tell me of poe
Oscar wilde and thoreau
Let your midnight and your daytime turn into love of life
Its a very fine line
But youve got the mind child
To carry on
When its just about to be
Carried on...

And theres only one meadows way to go
And you say geronimo
Theres only one meadows way to go
And you say geronimo

A paperback book
As we walk down the street
Fill my mind with tales of mystery, mystery...
And imagination

Forever fair
And Im touching your hair
I wish we could be dreamers
In this dream, ohhh
Let it dream

And theres only one meadows way to go
And you say geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And you say geronimo

Fair play to you
Killarneys lakes are so blue
High-ho silver, tit for tat
And I love you for that
High-ho silver, tit for tat
And I love you for that, love you for that, love you for that
High-ho silver, tit for tat, tit for tat
And I love you for that
High-ho silver, tit for tat, hah!
Yeah, yeah
And I love you for that

And theres only one meadows way to go
And i, and I say geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And we say geronimo
Geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And we say geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And we say geronimo

Fair play to you
