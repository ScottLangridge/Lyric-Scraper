(da da da....)

When you were a child, you were a tomboy
Gimme soul satisfaction
Way back in shady lane
Do you remember darlin?

And its the woman in you, and its the woman in you
Gimme soul satisfaction
And it takes the child in you to know
The woman an you are one

Were goin out in the country to get down to the real soul,
I mean the real soul, people,
Were goin out in the country, get down to the real soul

You don't pull no punches, but you don't push the river
You don't pull no punches, and you don't push the river
You don't pull no punches, and you don't push the river, no, no
Goin as much with the river as not

Were goin out in the west, down to the cathedrals

And the sisters of mercy, behind the sun
Oh behind the sun

With the river as not, with the river as not, goin as much,
