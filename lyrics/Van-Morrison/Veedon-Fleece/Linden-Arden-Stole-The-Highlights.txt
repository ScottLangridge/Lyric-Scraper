Linden arden stole the highlights --
With one hand tied behind his back --
Loved the morning sun, and whiskey
Ran like water in his veins
Loved to go to church on sunday
Even though he was a drinking man
When the boys came to san francisco
They were looking for his life
But he found out where they were drinking
Met them face to face outside
Cleaved their heads off with a hatchet
Lord, he was a drinkin man
And when someone tried to get above him
He just took the law into his own hands

Linden arden stole the highlights
And they put his fingers through the glass
He had heard all those stories many, many times before
And he did not know nor care to ask
And he loved the little children like they were his very own
You say, someday it may get lonely.
Now hes livin, livin with a gun
