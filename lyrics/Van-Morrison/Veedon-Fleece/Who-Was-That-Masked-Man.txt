Oh aint it lonely
When youre livin with a gun
Well you cant slow down and you cant turn round
And you cant trust anyone

You just sit there like a butterfly
And youre all encased in glass
Youre so fragile you just may break
And you dont know who to ask

Oh aint it lonely
When youre livin with a gun
Well you cant slow down and you cant turn round
And you cant trust anyone

You just sit there like a butterfly
Youre well protected by the glass
Youre such a rare collectors item
When they throw away whats the trash
You can hang suspended from a star
Or wish on a toilet roll
You can just soak up the atmosphere
Like a fish inside a bowl

When the ghost comes round at midnight
Well you both can have some fun
He can drive you mad, he can make you sad
He can keep you from the sun
When they take him down, hell be both safe and sound
And the hand does fit the glove
And no matter what they tell you,
Theres good and evil in everyone
