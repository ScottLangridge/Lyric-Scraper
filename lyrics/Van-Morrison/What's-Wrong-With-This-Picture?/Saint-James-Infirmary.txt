(Instrumental & horn intro)

(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

I went down to Saint James Infirmary
For to see, for to see my baby there
Man, she was laid out on a long white table
She was so cold, an' so pure, an' so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she might be
Yeah, you can search this whole
Search this whole wide world over
But she ain't never gonna find
Another lover man like me

When I die
I want you to dress me in straight-lace shoes
I want a boxback coat and a Stetson hat
I wanna twenty dollar gold piece, on my watch chain
So ev'rybody gonna know that I died standin' pat!

(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

(Instrumental & horns to end)
