Let us free you from the pain
Let us see you smile again
Let us unlock all the chains
Youre broken-hearted

Let us help you to forget
Let us help you unlock it
Its not nearly time to quit
Youve only started
You gotta

Sit down funny face
Let your laughter fill the room
Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Let your laughter fill the room
Let your laughter fill the room

Let us shake you by the hand
Let us help you understand
Take your head out of the sand
And shake it free now

Let us help you to go on
We are here to lean upon
Now you know exactly just who
You want to be now
Come on

Sit down funny face
Let your laughter fill the room
Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Let your laughter fill the room
Let your laughter fill the room

Let us lift you up on high
See the twinkle in your eye
Raise your head up to the sky
And say its easy

Hey let the trumpets ring it
Let the angels sing it
Let your pretty feet go dancing
Let your worn out mind go prancing
And

Sit down funny face
Let your laughter fill the room
Light up your golden smile
Take away all your misery and gloom
Let your laughter fill the room
Let your laughter fill the room
Etc.
