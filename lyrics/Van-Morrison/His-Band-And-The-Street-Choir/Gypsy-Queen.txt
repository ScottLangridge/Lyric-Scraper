Dance on gypsy queen
And if its all night,
Its alright
Rave on, let your love
Come tumbling down
And if you let your love come tumbling down,
Its alright

Dance on, you know its all right
Gypsy queen
Dance on, you know its all right
Gypsy queen

Rave on, there beneath the silvery moon
Dont stop your carburetor
Let your car run
And if it starts to rain
Keep on dancin in the rain
And if its all night
Its alright

Dance on, you know its all right
Gypsy queen
Dance on, you know its all right
Gypsy queen

Ooh la la la la la la la la la la
Dance dance dance the night away
Ooh la la la la la la la la la la
Dance dance dance the night away
Come on come on come on let me hear you say
Youre gonna dance on gypsy queen
Stars shine down on you
And its alright

Ooowee I wanna throw my arms around you
Im so glad Ive found you
Gypsy queen

Dance on, you know its all right
Gypsy queen
Dance on, you know its all right
Gypsy queen
Etc.
