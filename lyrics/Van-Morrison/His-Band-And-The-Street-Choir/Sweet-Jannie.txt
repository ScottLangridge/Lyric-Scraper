Oh sweet jannie wont you come out tonight
Oh sweet jannie girl wont you come out tonight
I want to take you walkin way out in the clear
Moonlight

Oh baby come on and take me by my hand
Oh baby come on and take me by my hand

I don't want to stop walkin till we
Get up to the preacher man

I've been in love with you baby
Ever since you were in sunday school
I've been in love with you baby
Ever since you were in sunday school

And I knew right there and then
I just wanted to be your fool

Oh sweet jannie wont you come out tonight
Oh sweet jannie girl wont you come out tonight
I want to take you walkin way out in the clear
Moonlight.
