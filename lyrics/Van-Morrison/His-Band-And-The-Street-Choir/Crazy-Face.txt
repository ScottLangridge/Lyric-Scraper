All the people were waiting for crazy face
He said hed meet them at his favourite place
Dressed in black satin, white linen and lace
With his head held high and a smile on his face

He said:
Ladies and gentlemen, the prince is late
As he stood outside the church-yard gate
And polished up on his .38 and said
I got it from jesse james.
