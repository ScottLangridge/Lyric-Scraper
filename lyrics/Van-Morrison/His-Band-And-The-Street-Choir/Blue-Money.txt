The photographer smiles
Take a break for a while
Take a rest, do your very best
Take five, honey

You search in your bag
Light up a fag
Think its a drag, but youre so glad
To be alive honey

Hey when this is all over
Youll be in clover
Well go out and spend
All of your blue money

Do do you do. .. Etc.

Well the cameraman smiles
Take a break for a while
Do your best, do your very best
Take five, honey

You search in your bag
Light up a fag
Say its a drag, but youre so glad
To be alive honey

When this is all over
Youll be in clover
Well go on out and spend
All of your blue money

Do do you do. .. Etc.

Blue money
Breau money
Juice money
Loose money
Blue money, honey
Breau money.
