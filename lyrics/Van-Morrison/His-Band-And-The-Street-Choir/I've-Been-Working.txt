I've been workin
I've been workin so hard
I've been workin
I've been workin so hard

When I come home
I make love to you, make love to you

I've been grindin
I've been grindin so long
I've been grindin
I've been grindin so long

I been up the thruway,
Down the thruway
Up the thruway, down the thruway,
Up the thruway, down, up down, back
Up again

I said woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel alright
I said woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
Make me feel alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
