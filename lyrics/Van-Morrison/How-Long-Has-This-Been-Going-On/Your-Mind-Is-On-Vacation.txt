Sitting there yakkin right in my face
Coming on like you own the place
If silence was golden
You couldnt raise a dime
Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime

Youre quoting figures, you're dropping names
Youre telling stories, you're playing games
You always laugh when things aint funny
You try to sound like you don't need money
If talk was criminal, you'd lead a life of crime
Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime

You know that life is short and talk is cheap
Don't make promises that you can't keep
If you don't like the song Im singing, just grin and bear it
All I can say is if the shoe fits wear it
If you must keep talking please can you make it rhyme
Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime
Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime
Cause your mind is on vacation and your mouth is working overtime
