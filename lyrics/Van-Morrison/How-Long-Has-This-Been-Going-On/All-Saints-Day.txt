Here comes sue and she looks crazy
Skipping down the hillside gaily
Looking like the flowers that bloom in may
Wont you make your reservation?
I will meet you at the station
Wont you come and see me, all saints day?

Follow my lead, it is no wonder, I seem to be so high
Living my dreams the way I ought to
As the days go rolling by
See me strolling through the meadow
With you baby by my side
Wont you come and see me, all saints day?

See the streamline blue horizon
With you baby by the way
Wont you come and see me, all saints day?
You can make your reservation
I will meet you at the station
When you come to see me, all saints day

When you come to see me, all saints day
When you come to see me, all saints day.
