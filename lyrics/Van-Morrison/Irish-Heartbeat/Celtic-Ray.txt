When lewellyn comes around
And he goes through market town
Youll be on the celtic ray
Are you ready?

When mcmannus comes around
On his early morning rounds
Crying hey...
Youll be on the celtic ray

Ireland, scotland, england and wales
I can hear the mothers voices calling
Children, children, children

When the coal brick man comes round
On a cold november day
Youll be on the celtic ray
Are you ready? are you ready?

Ireland, scotland, england and wales
I can hear the mothers voices calling
Children, children, children

Listen to me! I want to go home.
Listen to me! I want to go home.
Ive been away from the ray too long
Ive been away from the ray too long

All over ireland, scotland, england and wales
I can hear the mothers voices calling
Children, children, come home children
Children, come home on the celtic ray
In the early morning well go walking
Where the light comes shining through
On the celtic ray

Come home children
Come home on the celtic ray
