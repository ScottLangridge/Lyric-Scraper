Chorus:
Step we gaily on we go,
Heel and heel
And toe for toe,
Arm and arm
And row and row,
All for maries wedding.

Over hillways, up and down,
Myrtle green and bracken brown,
Past the sheilings through the town
All for the sake of marie.

Chorus

Red her cheeks as rowans are,
Bright her eyes as any star.
Fairest of them all by far,
Is our darlin marie.

Chorus
Plenty herring, plenty meal,
Plenty peat to fill her kreel.
Plenty bonnie bairns as well,
That's the toast for marie.

Repeat chorus
