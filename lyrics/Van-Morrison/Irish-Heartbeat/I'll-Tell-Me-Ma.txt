Ill tell me ma when I go home,
The boys wont leave the girls alone.
Theyll pull my hair, they stole my comb,
Well thats alright till I go home.

Chorus:
She is handsome. she is pretty.
She is the bell of belfast city.
She is courtin one, two, three.
Please wont you tell me, who is she?

Albert mooney says he loves her.
All the boys are fighting for her.
They knock at the door and ring at the bell
Sayin oh my true love, are you well?
Out she comes as white as snow,
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.
Oul jenny murray says shell die
If you dont get the fella
With the roving eye.

Let the wind and the rain and hail blow high
And the snow come tumbling from the sky,
Shes as nice as apple pie.
Shell get her own lad by and by.
When she gets a lad of her own,
She wont tell her ma when she gets home.
Let them all come as they will
For its albert mooney she loves still.

Repeat 1st verse and chorus
