Precious time is slipping away
But youre only king for a day
It doesn't matter to which God you pray
Precious time is slipping away

It doesn't matter what route you take
Sooner or later the hearts going to break
No rhyme or reason, no master plan
No nirvana, no promised land

Because, precious time is slipping away
Yuu know youre only king for a day
It doesn't matter to which God you pray
Precious time is slipping away

Say que sera, whatever will be
But then I keep on searching for immortality
Shes so beautiful but shes going to die some day
Everything in life just passes away

But, precious time is slipping away
You know shes only queen for a day
It doesn't matter to which God you pray
Precious time is slipping away

Well this world is cruel with its twists and turns
Well the fires still in me and the passion burns
I love a medley til the day I die
Til hell freezes over and the rivers run dry

Precious time is slipping away
You know shes only queen for a day
It doesn't matter to which God you pray because
Precious time is slipping away

Precious time is slipping away
You know youre only king for a day
It doesn't matter to which God you pray
Precious time is slipping away

Precious time is slipping away
You know youre only king for a day
It doesn't matter to which God you pray because
Precious time is slipping away
