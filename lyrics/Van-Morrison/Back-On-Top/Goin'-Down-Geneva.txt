Goin down geneva, give me a helping hand
I'm goin down geneva, give me a helping hand
Its not easy baby, living on the exile plan

Down on the bottom, down to my new pair of shoes
Down on the bottom, down to my new pair of shoes
I'm down by the lakeside, thinking bout my baby blue

Last night I played a gig in salzburg, outside in the pouring rain
Last night I played a gig in salzburg, outside in the pouring rain
Flew from there to montreux and my heart was filled with pain

Look out my window, back at the way things are
Look out my window pane, back at the way things are
Just wonder how, how did things ever get this far

Vince taylor used to live here, nobodys ever heard of him
Vince taylor used to live here, but nobodys heard of him, aint that a shame
Just who he was, just where he fits in

He was goin down geneva. Give him helping hand
He was goin down geneva, give him helping hand
It wasnt easy living on the exile plan

Vince taylor used to live here, nobodys even heard of him
Vince, vince taylor lives here, nobodys even heard of him
Just who he was, just where he fits in

Just who he was, just where he fits in
