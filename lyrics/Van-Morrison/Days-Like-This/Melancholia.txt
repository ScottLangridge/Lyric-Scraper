In the afternoon, baby in my room
When the lights are dim way beyond the hill
In the afternoon, baby in my room
When I'm really down get me off the ground
Melancholia, melancholia, melancholia

In the morning time when I go outside
In the morning time its like that all the while
In the afternoon when I'm in my room
Every single day, it wont go away
Melancholia, melancholia, melancholia

And its in my heart, when were apart
And it stops and starts, and its in my heart
Every single day its always in my way
When I'm making hay, all I've got to say
Melancholia, melancholia, melancholia

Well its in my blood and its in my veins
Here it comes again, when I'm in the rain
In the wind and rain, well the sun don't shine
Well its always mine, all of the time
Melancholia, melancholia, melancholia

And its in my life and its all the time
It doesn't go away when the church bells chime
In the evening time when I drink my wine
In the evening time when its on my mind
Melancholia, melancholia, melancholia

Its only melancholia
Oh melancholia, oh melancholia, oh melancholia, oh melancholia
Melancholia, melancholia
They call it, call it melancholia, call it melancholia, call it melancholia, call it melancholia
Call it melancholia, melancholia, melancholia, melancholia
