Im a songwriter and I know just where I stand
Im a songwriter, pen and paper in my hand
Get the words on the page
Please dont call me a sage,
Im a songwriter

Im a songwriter and I do it for a living
Im a songwriter and I write about men and women
I can write about love and the stars up above
Im a songwriter

Im a songwriter and Im hot on your trail
Im a songwriter and my cheques in the mail
I can move with the scene, I can make up a dream
Im a songwriter

Na na na nana, na na na nana

Im a songwriter I can do it for certain
Im a songwriter even do it when Im hurtin
And if it comes to the bit, have to write another hit
Im a songwriter

Im a songwriter I can put it in words
Im a songwriter and its not for the birds
I can spin you a yarn, its as long as my arm
Im a songwriter

Na na na nana, na na na nana
Im a songwriter
Na na na nana, na na na nana
Im a songwriter
