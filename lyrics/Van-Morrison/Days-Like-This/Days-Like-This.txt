When its not always raining therell be days like this
When theres no one complaining therell be days like this
When everything falls into place like the flick of a switch
Well my mama told me therell be days like this

When you don't need to worry therell be days like this
When no ones in a hurry therell be days like this
When you don't get betrayed by that old judas kiss
Oh my mama told me therell be days like this

When you don't need an answer therell be days like this
When you don't meet a chancer therell be days like this
When all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit
Then I must remember therell be days like this

When everyone is up front and theyre not playing tricks
When you don't have no freeloaders out to get their kicks
When its nobodys business the way that you wanna live
I just have to remember therell be days like this

When no one steps on my dreams therell be days like this
When people understand what I mean therell be days like this
When you ring out the changes of how everything is
Well my mama told me therell be days like this

Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
