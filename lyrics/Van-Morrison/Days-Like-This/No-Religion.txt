We didn't know no better, and they said it could be worse
Some people thought it was blessing
Other people think that its a curse
Its a choice between fact and fiction
And the whole world has gone astray
that's why theres no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And theres no straight answers
Of what this thing called love is all about
Some say its unconditional
Other people just remain in doubt
Well I cleaned up my diction, I had nothing left to say
Except theres no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And they ask what hate is
Its just the other side of love
Some people want to give their enemies
Everything they think that they deserve
Some say why don't you love your neighbours
Go ahead, turn the other cheek
But theres nobody on this planet that can ever be so meek
And I can't bleed for you
You have to do it your own way
And theres no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And they ask what hate is
Its just the other side of love
Some people want to give their enemies
Everything they think that they deserve
Some say why don't you love your neighbours
Go ahead, turn the other cheek
But have you ever met anybody whos ever been the meek
And its so cruel to expect the saviour to save the day
And theres no religion, no religion, no religion here today

And theres no mystery, and theres nothing hidden
And theres no religion here today

And theres no religion, no religion, no religion here today
