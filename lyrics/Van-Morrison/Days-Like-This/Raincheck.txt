Its not high finance, its called heart and soul
If its rock and roll, got to go, go, go, go, go
Gonna keep moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I got to stand my ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Wont let the bastards grind me down
Wont let the bastards grind me down
Wont let the bastards grind me down

Call me raincheck in the afternoon
Call me raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
Call me raincheck, on a golden autumn day
Call me raincheck, I wont fade away, I wont fade away
I dont fade away, I dont fade away, unless I want to

Cant take my love away, ah cause its here to stay
If it fades away, come back another day
Gonna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Gonna keep on moving on up, oh gonna stand my ground
Wont let the bastards grind me down
Wont let the bastards grind me down
Wont let the bastards grind me down

My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I dont fade away, I dont fade away
I dont fade away, I dont fade away, unless I want to

Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Grind me down, grind me down, grind me down

My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I dont fade away, I dont fade away
I dont fade away, I dont fade away, unless I want to

Put on your dancing shoes, dance away your blues
When Im feeling like this, I got nothing to lose
Wanna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Wanna keep on moving on up and Ill stick around
Wanna keep on moving on up, got to stand my ground
Wont let the bastards grind me down
Wont let the bastards grind me down
Oh, wont let the bastards grind me down

My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I dont fade away, I dont fade away
I dont fade away, I dont fade away, unless I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose

No, I dont fade away, I dont fade away, I dont fade away
Unless I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
No, I wont fade away, I wont fade away, I dont fade away
Unless I want to
