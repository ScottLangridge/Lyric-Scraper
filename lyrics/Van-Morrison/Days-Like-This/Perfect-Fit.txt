Now baby just lately youve been holding back too much
Your looks and my language, this could be the perfect touch
What you are asking fits with everything on my list
This could be the perfect fit

Tell me that its madness to want something quite like this
But they don't understand the magic that I can't resist
Oh and wouldnt it be so tragic if everything just went amiss
And this could be the perfect fit

They say no-one is perfect some people might take the piss
And we say were just friends come on, tell me whats wrong with this
But I say keep it simple, well we haven't even started yet
And this could be the perfect fit

See that dress youre wearing baby suits you right down to the ground
Tell me where in my world a better loving woman can be found
Well I've searched high and low now and from where you and I sit
Baby, this could be the perfect fit
Baby, this could be the perfect fit
Come on baby, this could be the perfect fit

Fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, say again
This could be the perfect fit
Fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit
This could be the perfect fit
