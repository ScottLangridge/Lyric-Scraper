Well I'm higher than the world
And I'm livin in my dreams
Ill make it better than it seems
Today

And I'm higher than a cloud
And I'm living in the sound
Ill make it better than it seems
Today

Higher than the world
But my head is in a swirl
I gotta give a life a whirl
Today

Higher than the clouds
Wrapped up in the sound
Ill make it better all around
Today

Higher than the world
But my head is in a swirl
I gotta give a life a whirl
Today

Higher in my mind
I'm going leave these blues behind
And Ill find what I find
Today

Cause I'm higher than the world
And I'm wrapped up in my dreams
Ill make it better than it seems
Today

Yes, I'm higher than the world
And I'm livin in my mind
I got to hold on to what I find
Today

Just a little bit higher
Little bit higher
