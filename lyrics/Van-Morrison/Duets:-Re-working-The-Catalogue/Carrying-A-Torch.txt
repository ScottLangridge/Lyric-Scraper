I'm carryin a torch for you
I'm carryin a torch
You know how much it costs
To keep carryin a torch

Flame of love it burns so bright
That is my desire
Keep on liftin me, liftin me up
Higher and higher

Youre the keeper of the flame
And you burn so bright
Baby why don't we re-connect
Move into the light

I've been going to and fro on this
And I'm still carryin a torch
You must know how much its worth
When I'm carryin a torch (alright)

Baby youre the keeper of the flame
And you burn so bright
Why, why, why, why, why, why don't we re-connect
And move on further, into the light

I've been calling you on the phone
'cause I'm carryin a torch (yeah)
I can do it all on my own
'cause I'm carryin a torch

I'm carryin a torch for you, baby
I'm carryin a torch
You know how much its worth
Because I'm carryin a torch (one more)

I'm carryin a torch for you, baby
I'm carryin a torch
You know how much its worth
Because I'm carryin a torch.
