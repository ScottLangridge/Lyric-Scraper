They can be keen
To be everything
But it comes with the state
When you were born to sing

Reasons as I walked in
It's not done on a whim
Passions everything when
You were born to sing

Feeling good singin the blues
It aint easy  keep on payin them dues
When it gets to the part
Well let's not stop and start
Deep down in your heart you know
You were born to sing

Instrumental Bit

When you came in
No original sin
You were a king because
You were born to sing

Reasons as I walked in

It's not done on a whim
Passions everything when
You were born to sing

Yeah - feeling good singin the blues
Keep on keepin on  keep on
Payin them dues
When it comes to the part
Well let's not stop and start
Deep down in your heart  baby
You were born to sing

When it gets to the part
When the band start to swing
Then you know everything
Cause you were born to sing

When it gets to the part
When the band start to swing
Then you know everything
Cause you were born to sing Instrumental to end
