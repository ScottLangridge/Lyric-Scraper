You see me on the street, well you guess I'm doing fine
Oh but its fantasy baby, almost all the time
I've got to get away, by myself
Oh the way its going, soon be needing help
'cause I'm just a man, doing the best I can
Don't you understand, I just want some peace of mind

You see me on the stage, doing my job
I learn to do it well, keep on singing the song
But sometimes it gets, so lonely out there
When youre on the road and youre going nowhere
Because I'm just a man, oh I aint got no plans
Don't you understand, I'm just trying to find some peace of mind

I have to stand in line, baby when I'm in queue
I got to do it all, just the same as you
Got my doubts about it, oh but I try
Oh make it work with tears in my eyes
Because I'm just a man, only trying to do the best I can
Don't you understand, I want some peace of mind

Oh I'm just a man, baby I aint got no plan
Oh don't you understand, got to get some peace of mind
Oh got to get, got to get some peace of mind
Oh got to get, got to get some peace of mind
Got to get, got to get some peace of mind
Got to, got to, got to get, got to get, get some peace of mind
Got to get, got to get, get some peace of mind
Get me some, get me some, get me some, get me some peace of mind
Get me some, get me some, peace of mind
Get me some baby, get me some peace of mind.
