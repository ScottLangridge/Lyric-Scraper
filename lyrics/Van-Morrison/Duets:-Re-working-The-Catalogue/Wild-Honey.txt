Open your arms in the early mornin
When the light comes shinin through
can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
Its beating so wild, honey.
And light comes shinin
Singin my song
And the band is playin
And the music is tried and true
can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
Its beating so wild, honey.
And light comes shinin
Ill be waiting for you
Ill be waiting here for me
Way up on the mountain
Where the hillside rolls down to the sea
Tell me whats real?
What I feel inside
Any time of day or night will do
Its alright
can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
Its beating so wild, honey.
And your light comes shining through.
Tell me whats real
What I feel inside
Any time of day or night will do
Its alright.
Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
Its beating so wild, honey.
And the light comes shining through
And the light comes shining through. ..
Its beating so wild. ..
And the light comes shining through
And the light comes shining through.
