(Sam Cooke)
If you ever (play it slowly) change your mind
About leavin-a, leavina me behind-a
Bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin' home
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Home to me
I've given ya jewelry and money, too
Then I know, hu, I can do for you
Ooh, honey, bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home
God, knows I've tried to treat you right
I just stayed out, stayed out all night
Oh, want cha ta to bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on home to me
Jack!
[Instrumental
