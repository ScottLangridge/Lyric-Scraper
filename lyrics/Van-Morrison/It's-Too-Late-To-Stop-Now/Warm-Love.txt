Look at the ivy on the cold clinging wall
Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall
Its not a matter of when push comes to shove
Its just an hour on the wings of a dove

I dig it when you're fancy dressed up in lace
I dig it when you have a smile on your face
This inspirations got to be on the flow
This invitations got to see it and know

Its just warm love
Its just warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love

To the country Im going
Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring, bring your guitar along
Well sing some songs, well have some fun

The sky is crying and it's time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
Its raining outside from the skies up above

Inside it's warm love
Inside it's warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
Warm love
Warm love
