(Sonny Boy Williamson, Ralph Bass, Willie Dixon)
You gotta help me
Can't do it all by myself
Yout gotta
Can't do it all by myself
You don't help me darlin'
Find someone else
When I walk, I walk with you
When I talk, I talk to you
Oh baby, can't do it all by myself
Don't help me darlin'
Find someone else
Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
Bring me my nightshirt
Put on your morning gown
I don't feel tired
But I, sho' feel like lyin' down
Oh Lord, help me
[Instrumental
