Youve got to try, for the kingdom
Youve got to try, for the kingdom
On high, youve got to try,
By his grace, by his grace

Youve got to live your religion
Deep inside, when you try
For the kingdom on high
By his grace, by his grace

Open your mind to the wisdom
When you try for the kingdom, on high
By his grace, by his grace

Open your heart to the wisdom
In your mind when you try
For the kingdom on high
By his grace, by his grace

One day at a time, you got to try
Open your eye, it will come
By and by, when you try
By his grace, by his grace
By his grace, by his grace.
