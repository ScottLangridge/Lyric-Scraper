So complicated, so complicated
Just wanna blow my horn
So complicated, so complicated
Just wanna know the score

Are you telling me that everythings fine
When I cant even tie my shoes
Better get into a new frame of mind
When I dont have to think about the business no more
'cause I just wanna blow my horn

The telephone is ringing out
But it dont understand my blues
And how much longer will it take
Until they get the news

The weather man said it was good
He forecast it was truly great
So if you change your train of thought
You know it wont be late

Too complicated, too complicated
You know this crazy scene
Too complicated, too complicated
No one says what they mean

Are you telling me that everythings fine
When I cant even tie my shoes
Better get into a new frame of mind
When I dont have to think about the business no more
'cause I just wanna blow my horn.
