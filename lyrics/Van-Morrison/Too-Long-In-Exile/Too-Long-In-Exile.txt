Too long in exile
Too long not singing my song
Too long in exile
Too long like a rolling stone
Too long in exile

Too long in exile
Baby those people just aint, just aint your friends
Too long in exile my friend
You can never go home again

Well that isolated feeling
Drives you so close up against the wall
Till you feel like you can't go on
Youve been in the same place for too long

Too long in exile
Baby you can never go back home
Too long in exile
Anyway you want

Oh that isolated feeling
Drives you up against, up against the wall
Cos youve been on the mainland baby
Been on the mainland, cominon strong

Too long in exile
Too long people keep hanging on
Too long in exile
Too long like a rolling stone

And the wheeling and the dealing
All takes up too much time
Check your better self baby
Youd better satisfy, satisfy your mind

Too long in exile
Too long youve been grinding at the mill
Too long in exile
Man, I've really just had my fill

Too long in exile
You can never go back home again
Too long in exile
Youre about to drive me just insane

Too long in exile, been too long in exile
Just like james joyce, baby
Too long in exile
Just like samuel beckett baby
Too long in exile
Just like oscar wilde
Too long in exile
Just like george best, baby
Too long in exile
Just like alex higgins, baby
Too long in exile
