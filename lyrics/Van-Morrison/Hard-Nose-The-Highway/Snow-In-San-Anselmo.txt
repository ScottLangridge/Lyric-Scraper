Snow in san anselmo
The deer cross by the lights
The mission down in old san rafael
A madman looking for a fight
A madman looking for a fight

The massage parlors open
The clientele come and they go
The classic music station
Plays in the background soft and low
Plays in the background soft and low

The silence round the cascades
The ice crisp and clear
The beginning of the opera
Seem to suddenly appear
Seem to suddenly appear

The pancake house is always crowded
Open 24 hours of every day
And if you suffer from insomnia
You can speed your time away
You can speed your time away

Snow in san anselmo
My waitress my waitress my waitress
Said it was coming down
Said it hadnt happened in over 30 years
But it was laying on the ground
But it was laying on the ground
