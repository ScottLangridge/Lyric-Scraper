I ate it and at once my eyes could see you
No sooner had I ooped it down
I felt so far off from the ground I stood on.

My legs they seemed to me like high-rise buildings
My head was high up in the sky
My skin the sun began to fry like bacon.

And then somebody old appeared and asked had I come far. ..
And hadnt they just seen me up on haleakala. ..
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadnt heard
There was someone there beside me, swimming like richard iii
And I'm still smiling

Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools. ..
Lone-ranger smoking doobies said youre breaking all the rules. ..
Youd better get your clothes on or else therell be a row. ..
If it wasnt for my sunstroke I would take you on right now. ..
And I'm still smiling.

I fell in love with my soft-hearted hana
She entered right in through my heart
And now although were miles apart
I still feel her.

She lives beneath the crater in the meadow
She moves among the fruit and grain
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallen.
