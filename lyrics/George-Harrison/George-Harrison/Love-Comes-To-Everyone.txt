Go do it,
Got to go through that door,
Theres no easy was out at all. ..
Still it only takes time
til love comes to everyone.

For you who it always seems blue
It all comes, it never rains
But it pours,
Still it only takes time. ..
Til love comes to everyone.

There in your heart. ..
Something that's never changing;
Always a part of. ..
Something that's never ageing,
that's in your heart. ..

Its so true it can happen to you all; there,
Knock and it will open wide,
And it only takes time
til love comes to everyone.
