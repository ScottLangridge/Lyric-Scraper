Baltimore oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the tangipaho - down in louisiana
Where a two - timin jaybird
Met the divine miss o

Id like to ruffle his plumage
That baltimore oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin is easy - its a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing
Send her back home
Home aint home without her warbling
How she can sing
Make a lonely man happy, baltimore oriole
Come down from that bough
Fly to your daddy now
