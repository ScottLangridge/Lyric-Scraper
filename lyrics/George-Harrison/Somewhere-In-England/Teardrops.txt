Teardrops - I've had my share of crying buckets
Full of
Teardrops - so hard to take - I got a soaking
With those
Teardrops - and it feels like I have taken over from
The rain.

In the heart of the lonely man
In and out of love more often where most others can
He walks the streets like the losers in some
Lovers game
He talks so sweet but the news is always much
The same.

Teardrops - I've had my share of crying buckets
Full of
Teardrops - so hard to take - I got a soaking
With those
Teardrops - and it feels like I have taken over from
The rain.

In the eyes of the lonely one
Everything is cold and hopeless that he looks
Upon
He needs a friend a lover who can comfort him
His deeds offend he knows that he has brought
On him.

Teardrops - I've had my share of crying buckets
Full of
Teardrops - so hard to take - I got a soaking
With those
Teardrops - and it feels like I have taken over from
The rain.
