Its the story of a very unfortunate coloured man
Who got arrested down in old hong kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old buddhas gong

And now hes poppin the piano just to raise the
Price
Of a ticket to the land of the free
Well, he says his homes in frisco where they
Send the rice
But its really in tennessee

Thats why he says
I need someone to love me
Need somebody to carry me home to san
Francisco
And bury my body there
I need someone to lend me a fifty-dollar bill
And then
Ill leave hong kong far behind me
For happiness once again

Wont somebody believe
Ive a yen to see that bay again
Everytime I try to leave
Sweet opium wont let me fly away
I need someone to love me
Need somebody to carry me home to san
Francisco
And bury my body there

Thats the story of a very unfortunate coloured man
Who got arrested down in old hong kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old buddhas gong
