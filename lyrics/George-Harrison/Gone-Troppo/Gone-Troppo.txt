There he, sitting in the moonlight
Not found, livin no city
He smile, mucho in a sunshine
High life, counting de fruit bat

Troppo, gone troppo, troppo
Its time you know I gone troppo

Plant me, in de helicona
No thank, meeting de peoples
Wake me, eata the papaya
Much hot, not much on the body

Troppo, gone troppo, gone troppo
Its time you know I gone troppo

Warm sea, see right to the bottom
No like, shoveling snowfall
Good time, drinking on me bottle
The high wide moreton bay fig

Troppo, gone troppo, troppo
Its time you know I gone troppo

Quite like, you aint seen a sunset
Could be, living in rain hill
Sun hot, you don't got a backache
Brown skin and very a peeling

Troppo, gone troppo, gone troppo
Its time you know I gone troppo
