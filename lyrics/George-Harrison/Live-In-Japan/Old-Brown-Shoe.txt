I want a love that's right
Right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

Now Im steppin out this old brown shoe
Baby Im in love with you
So glad you came here, it wont be the same
Now Im telling you

You know you picked me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing evry thoughtless frown

Got me escaping from the zoo
Baby Im in love with you
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same
Now Im telling you

If I'll grow up I'll be a singer
Wear rings on evry finger
Not worrying about what they or you'll say
Live and love and maybe someday, who knows baby
You may comfort me (yeah)

I may appear to be imperfect
But my love is something you can't reject
Changing faster than the weather
You and me should get together, who knows baby
You may comfort me

I want the love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
Ill make an early start
Im making sure that Im not late

For your sweet lip Im in the queue
Baby Im in love with you
Im so glad you came here, it wont be the same
Now Im telling you

So glad you came here
It wont be the same now Im telling you
So glad you came here
It wont be the same now when Im with you
Oh yeah yeah
