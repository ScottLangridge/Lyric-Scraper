Remember, now, be here now
As its not like it was before.
The past, was, be here now
As its not like it was before - it was

Why try to live a life,
That isn't real,
No how
A mind, that wants to wander,
Round a corner,
Is an un-wise mind

Now, is, be here now
And its not what it was before,
Remember, now, be here now
As its not like it was before - it was
