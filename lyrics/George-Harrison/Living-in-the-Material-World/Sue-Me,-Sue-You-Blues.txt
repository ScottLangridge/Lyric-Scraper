You serve me
And I'll serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer
And I'll bring mine
Get together, and we could have
A bad time

Its affidavit swearing time
Sign it on the dotted line
Hold your Bible in your hand
Now all that's left is to
Find yourself a new band . . .

Were gonna play the sue me, sue
You blues
Were gonna play the sue me, sue
You blues

Hold the block on money flow
Move it into joint escrow
Court receiver, laughs, and thrills
But in the end we just pay those
Lawyers theit bills

When you serve me
And I serve you
Swing your partners, all get screwed
Bring your lawyer
And I'll bring mine
Get together, and we could have
A bad time

Were gonna play the sue me, sue
You blues

Im tired of playing the
Sue me, sue you blues
