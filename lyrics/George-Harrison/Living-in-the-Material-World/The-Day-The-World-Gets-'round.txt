The day the world gets round
To understanding where it is,
Using all its found,
To help each other, hand in hand

The day the world gets round
To understanding where its gone
Losing so much ground
Killing each other, hand in hand
Such foolishness in man
I want no part of their plan - oh no

If youre the destructive kind
Now Im working from day to day
As I dont want to be like you
I look for the pure of heart
And the ones that have made a start,

But lord, there are just a few
Who bow before you,
In silence they pray,

Oh how they pray for the day the
World gets round

Using all theyve found
To help each other, hand in hand

The day the world gets round
