Give Me Love
George Harrison

{Refrain}
Give me love, give me love
Give me peace on Earth
Give me light, give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope to help me cope
With this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you
With heart and soul

My Lord
Please
Take hold of my hand
That I might understand you
Won't you please, oh won't you

{Refrain}

My Lord
Won't you please, oh won't you

{Refrain x 2}
