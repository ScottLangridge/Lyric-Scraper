I don't want you
But I hate to lose you
You got me in between the devil and the
Deep blue sea

I forgive you
'Cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the
Deep blue sea

I want to cross you off my list
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you
But I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the
Deep blue sea
