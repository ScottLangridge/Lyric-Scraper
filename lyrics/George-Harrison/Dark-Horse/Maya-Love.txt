Maya love - maya love,
Maya love is like the sea
Flowing in and out of me
Maya love - maya love,
Maya love is like the day
First it comes, then it rolls away
Maya love - maya love,
Maya love is like the wind
Blowing hard on everything
Maya love - maya love,
Maya love is like the rain
Beating on your window brain
Maya love - maya love,
Maya love is like the stream
Flowing through this cosmic dream
