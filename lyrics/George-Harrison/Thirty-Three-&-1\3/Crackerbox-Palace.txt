I was so young when I was born
My eyes could not yet see
And by the time of my first dawn
Somebody holding me, they said

I welcome you to crackerbox palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in crackerbox palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true

While growing up or trying to
Not knowing where to start
I looked around for someone who
May help reveal my heart - someone said

While you're a part of cracerbox palace
Do what the rest all do
Or face the fact that crackerbox palace
May have no other choice than to deport you

I welcome you to crackerbox palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in crackerbox palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true

Sometimes are good, sometimes are bad
That's all a part of life
And standing in between them all
I met a Mr. Grief - and he said

I welcome you to crackerbox palace
Was not expecting you
Lets rap and tap at crackerbox palace
Know that the lord is well and inside of you

And we welcome you to crackerbox palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in crackerbox palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true

You bring such joy in crackerbox palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true
