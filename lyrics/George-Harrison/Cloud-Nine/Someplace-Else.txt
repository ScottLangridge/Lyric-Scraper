(someplace else)

You got into my life
I don't know how you found me, but you did
It stopped me heading someplace else

Took me a while to say
Wish you belong to me
But now I'm saddened like I've never been
Regretting that well leave

And for a while you could comfort me
And hold me for some time
I need you now to be beside me
While all my world is so untidy

Loneliness (oh-o-oh)
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)
In someplace else

(someplace else)

I hope you wont let go
Maybe youll let me know
That youll be saddened like youve never been
Regretting that well leave

And for a while I could comfort you
And hold you in my mind
I need you now to be beside me
While all my world is sad and crazy

Loneliness (oh-o-oh)
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)
In someplace else

And for a while you could comfort me
And hold me for some time
I need you now to be beside me
While all my world is so untidy

Loneliness (oh-o-oh)
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)
In someplace else

Loneliness (oh-o-oh)
Empty faces (oh-o-oh)
Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)
In someplace else

(someplace else)

I think I'm gonna leave them all
In someplace else

(someplace else)
