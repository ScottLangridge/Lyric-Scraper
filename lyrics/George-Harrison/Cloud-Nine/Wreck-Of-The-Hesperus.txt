I'm not the wreck of the hesperus
Feel more like the wall of china
Getting old as methuselah
Feel tall as the eiffel tower

I'm not a power of attorney
But I can rock as good as gibraltar
Aint no more no spring chicken
Been plucked but I'm still kicking
But its alright, its alright

Poison penmen sneak, have no nerve to speak
Make up lies then they leak m out
Behind a pseudonym, the rottenness in them
Reaching out trying to touch me

Met some oscars and tonys
I slipped on a pavement oyster
Met a snake climbing ladders
Got out of the line of fire
(but its alright)

Brainless writers gossip nonsenses
To others heads as dense as they is
Its the same old malady
What they see is faulty

I'm not the wreck of the hesperus
Feel more like big bill broonzy
Getting old as my mother
But I tell you I got some company
(but its alright)

But its alright, its alright
But its alright, its alright
Its alright, alright
Its alright
