Chorus:
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...

Can I start with a goodbye
You are there with...
This is so...
Combinations that will...

Chorus:
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...

... What I saw and what was before my eyes

... That will take you...

Chorus:
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Chorus:
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...
Bi, bicycles rode so smooth,
Under the clouds, over the skies the stars
All I be get...
