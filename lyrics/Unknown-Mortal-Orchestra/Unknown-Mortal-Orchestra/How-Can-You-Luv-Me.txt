How can you love me
When you dont like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see
The lonely tears?

And I dont know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

How can you love me
When you dont like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see
The lonely tears?

And I dont know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

How can you love me
When you dont like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see
The lonely tears?

And I dont know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

How can you love me
When you dont like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see
The lonely tears?

And I dont know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground
