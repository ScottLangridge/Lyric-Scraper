Its fun to pretend
That were not in love
So we can fall in
To love again (X2)

Love is quite easy to find (love is very easy)
When youre unsleazy and kind
Theres a madness in your mind

Jenny my friend
Its fun to pretend
That we are strangers
So we can be strange
Like strangers are strange (X2)

Love is quite easy to find (love is very easy)
When youre unsleazy and kind
Theres a madness in your mind
