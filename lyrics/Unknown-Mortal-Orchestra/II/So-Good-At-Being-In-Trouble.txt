Now that youre gone
Its been a long lonely time
Its a long, sad lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
Its a strange old state of mind

Memories they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad being in love

Now that youre gone
Its been a long lonely time
Its a long, sad lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
Its a strange old state of mind

Memories they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny, to deny
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad being in love.
