I'm going to hide from the rain
I am tired of running round while these nuns eat my grain
Ransacking, wolfpacking rats in a cult of fame, so lame

Secret Christians are all the same
Don't be grumpy and cold
If you want to I can burn up a hole in this coal

Don't be surprised if it warms up right when we die
Tonight

Secret Christians
Are not too bright
