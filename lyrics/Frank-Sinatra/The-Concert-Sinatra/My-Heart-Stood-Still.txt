[Version 1]

[Frank and chorus] (chorus only)

[Frank speaks]
When most us saddle up for the old trail for our last ride, we leave little
enough behind to show that once we have camped here. Some leave more than
others, some a memory and some a fortune, some a song. And a song can be as
fine a memorial to a man as anything that can be left behind, 'cause you see
it's gold, and it's gold that all can share. We have a great song to
remember Lorenz Hart by, that wonderful melody that he and Dick Rodgers
wrote for the Connecticut Yankee, of course you know, My Heart Stood Still
[sings]
I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still.
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still.
(That unfelt clasp of hands told me how well you knew, hmmmm)
I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools
(A house in Iceland was my heart's domain)
(I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!)
[a brief interlude through the first verse]
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well that you knew
I never lived at all [until the thrill of that moment]
[When my heart stood still.]


[Version 2]

I took one look at you,
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me very well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still
