Though my world may go awry
In my heart 't will ever lie
Just the echo of a sigh

I'll see you again whenever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between but what has been is past forgetting
This sweet memory across the years will come to me

Though my world may go awry
In my heart 't will ever lie
Just the echo of a sigh goodbye
