I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront
In search of my love
And I'm covered by
A starless sky above

Here am I patiently waiting
Hoping and longing oh, how I yearn
Where are you? Are you forgetting?
Do you remember and will you return?

I cover the waterfront
And I'm watching the sea
For the one I love
Must soon come back to me

For the one I love
Must soon come back to me
