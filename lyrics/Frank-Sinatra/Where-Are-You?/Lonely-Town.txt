New York, New York or a village in Iowa
The only difference is the name
If you're alone whether on Main Street or on Broadway
If you're alone they are both the same

A town's a lonely town when you pass through
And there is no one waiting there for you
Then it's a lonely town, you wander up and down
The crowds rush by, a million faces pass before your eyes

Still it's a lonely town unless there's love
A love that's shining like a harbor light
You're lost in the night unless there's love
The world's an empty place and every town's a lonely town
