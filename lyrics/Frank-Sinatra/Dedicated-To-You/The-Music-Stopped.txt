The music stopped

But we were still dancing

Which goes to show

That music has charm

The lights were low

So we kept on dancing

I fealt the glow

Of you in my arms

[Bridge:]

The band had left the stand

And we were in heaven

Dancing on a cloud

Way off in the blue

The music stopped

And people were glancing

But we went on dancing

For we didn't know

Because the lights were low

And we were in love
