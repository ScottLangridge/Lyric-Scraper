Did you say (that) I've got a lot to learn, well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn, teach me tonight
Starting with the abc of it, getting right down to the xyz of it
Help me solve the mystery of it, teach me tonight
The sky's a blackboard high above you, a nd if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you", a thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear my love, teachers shouldn't stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love, you'd better teach me tonight
I've played loves scenes in a flick or two, and I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two, hey teach me tonight
I who thought I knew the score of it, kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it, hey teach me tonight
The midnight hours come slowly creeping when there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping single in a bed for two
What I need most is post graduate, what I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate, you'd better teach me tonight
What do you get for lessons, teach me - come on and teach me - teach me tonight
