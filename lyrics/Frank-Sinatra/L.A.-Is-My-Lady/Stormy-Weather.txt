Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When she went away, the blues walked in and they met me
If she stays away, that old rockin' chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time

Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time, the time
Keeps rainin' all the time
