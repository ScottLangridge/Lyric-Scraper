Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel the real mccoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it granada I see or only asbury park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?
