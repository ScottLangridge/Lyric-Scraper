I must confess what you say is true
I had a rendezvous with somebody new
That's the only one I ever had
Baby, baby, don'cha go away mad

Cheatin' shows and it never goes
You got a reason to be mad I suppose
But she only was a passin' fad
Ba-by, don't you be mad

Her kind's a dime a dozen
And that's not the kind I want
Who'd ever dream your cousin
Would wander into that restaurant?

I understand that you feel upset
Whaddya you say that you forgive and forget?
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad
Baby, baby don'cha go away mad

[instrumental]

Now, her kind's a dime a dozen
I should've passed her by
Who'd ever dream your cousin
Would come along and give us the eye?

I understand that feel upset
Whaddya you say that you forgive and forget?
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad
Baby, don'cha go away mad

Understand that you're quite upset
Whaddya you say that you forgive and forget?
Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don'cha go
'way mad

Now, don'cha go away mad
