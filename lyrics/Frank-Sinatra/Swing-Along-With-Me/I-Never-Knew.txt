I always thought that I'd prefer single-blessed-ness
Thought that I'd like to stay free
I never thought my time would come to marry,
No wedding bells for me, I've changed my mind after all,
You are the one made me fall, for...
I used to smile at all the songs that were popular,
Nothing but love in each song,
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish,
Now I admit I'm wrong.
Love songs are part of my plan, show me the minister man, for...

I never knew I could love anybody,
Honey, like I'm loving you
