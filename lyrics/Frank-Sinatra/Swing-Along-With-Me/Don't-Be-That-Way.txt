April skies are in your eyes, but darling, don't be blue
Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way.
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of May
Tears are in vain, so honey please don't be that way
As long as we see it through, you'll have me, I'll have you
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart, oh honey, please don't be that way

Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of May
Tears in vain, so honey please don't be that way
As long as we will see it through
You'll have me and I'll have you
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
Don't break my heart, nh honey, please don't be that way,
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
