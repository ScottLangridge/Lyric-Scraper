And when I hear you call so softly to me,
I don't hear a call at all, I hear a rhapsody.
And when your sparkling eyes are smiling at me,
Then soft through the starlit skies, I hear a rhapsody
My days are so blue when you're away,
My heart longs for you, so won't you stay?
My darling, hold me tight and whisper to me
Then soft through the starry night I hear a rhapsody
