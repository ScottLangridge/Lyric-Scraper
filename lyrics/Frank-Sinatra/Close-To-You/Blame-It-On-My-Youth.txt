You were my adored one
Then you became the bored one
And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away

If I expected love when first we kissed, blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist, blame it on my youth
I believed in everything like a child of three
You meant more than anything all the world to me

If you were on my mind all night and the day, blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray, blame it on my youth
And if I cried a little bit when first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on my heart, blame it on my youth
