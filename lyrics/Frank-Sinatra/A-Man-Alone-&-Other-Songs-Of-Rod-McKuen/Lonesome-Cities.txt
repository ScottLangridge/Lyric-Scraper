There's a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see,
While the wine of wondering is still inside of me,
There's a few more pretty women that I'd like to know,
Bridge or two I'd like to cross, a few more oats to sow,
Maybe when I've done it all, seen all there is to see,
I'll find out I still cannot run away from me.
But as long as trains keep running, restless man I'll be
And there's a few more lonesome cities that I've yet to see.

One or two more lonesome cities that I've yet to see.
