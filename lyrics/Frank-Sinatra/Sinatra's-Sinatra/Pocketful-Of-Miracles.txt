Pee-rac-ti-cal-i-ty de-us-nt interest me
Love the life that I lead
I've got a pocketful of miracles
And with a pocketful of miracles
One little miracle a day is all I need

Tee-rub-bles, more or less
Bee-ar-the-me, I guess, when the sun doesnt shine
But there's that pocketful of miracles
And with a pocketful of miracles
The worlds a bright and shiny apple that's mine, all mine

I hear sleigh bells ringing, smack in the middle of May
I go around like there's snow around
I feel so good, it's Christmas every day

Lee-ifes a carousel, fee-ar as I can tell
And I'm riding for free
So if youre down and out of miracles
I've got a pocketful of miracles
And there will miracles enough for you and me

(I hear sleigh bells ringing), smack in the middle of May
I go around like there's snow around
(I feel so good, it's Christmas every day)

Lee-ifes a carousel, fee-ar as I can tell
And I'm riding for free
(I've got a pocketful of miracles)
But if I had to pick a miracle
My favorite miracle of all is you and me
