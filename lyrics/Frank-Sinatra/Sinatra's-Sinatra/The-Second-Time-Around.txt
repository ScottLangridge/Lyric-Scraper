Love is lovelier, the second time around
Just as wonderful, with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Loves more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say, what brought us to this miracle weve found

There are those whod bet
Love comes but once - and yet
I'm oh so glad we met
The second time around
