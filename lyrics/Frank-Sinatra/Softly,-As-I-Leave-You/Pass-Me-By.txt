(Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen
To like it, pass me by)
I got me ten fine toes
To wiggle in the sand
Lots of idle
Fingers snap to my command
A loverly pair of heels
That kick
To beat the band
Contemplating nature
Can be fascinating
Add to these a nose
That I can thumb
And a mouth
By gum have I
So tell
The whole wide world
If you don't happen
To like it
Deal me out
Thank you kindly
Pass me by

Behold me two great shoes
That never saw a shine
Houses I could hold up
With a laundry line

A loverly patch that hide
An awful lot of spine
Shirtails flying
I'm a blooming dandelion
Add to these
A grin from ear to ear
All the proper gear have I
So tell
The whole wide world
If you don't like
The thought of it
Bail me out
Thank you kindly
Pass me by
