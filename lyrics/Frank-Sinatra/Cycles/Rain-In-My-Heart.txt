My eyes are dry, my love
Since you've been gone
I haven't she'd a tear
I'll never cry, my love
Though every day
Seems like a hundred years
For I'm just a fool
Who clings to his pride

But when I'm alone
I can hear
The sound of rain
In my heart
Of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart
'Cause I keep them inside
I can't get away
From the sound of the rain
In my heart

How could I know, my love
I was a toy
Only a game to you?
How could you go, my love
Without a thought
Of what I'm going through?

How can I forget
I still love you so
It echoes each time that I hear
The sound of rain in my heart
From the tears that I hide
So it tears me apart
I still keep them inside

But I can't escape
From the sound
Of the rain in my heart
I hear that rain in my heart
Of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart
'Cause I keep them inside
