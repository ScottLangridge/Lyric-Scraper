She says she's sleeping well, she says she's lost some weight
She says she's seen some shows, she says the city's strange
(So she says) She says the weather's cold, she says there's been some rain
She says there's lots to see, she says she hopes we're fine (So she says)
(So she says) The price is high, high as the sky
And she says, she says, she's comin' home
