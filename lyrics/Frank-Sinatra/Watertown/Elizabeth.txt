Dressed in dreams for me, you were what I wished to see, Elizabeth, Elizabeth
Love was very new, make believe was coming true, Elizabeth, Elizabeth
You were all much too much, out of reach and out of touch
When you came to me, I found it could never be, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth
So a dream has to end when it's real, not pretend, dressed in memories
You are what you used to be, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth
