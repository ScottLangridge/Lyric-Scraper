Lost in day to day, turn another way
With a laugh, a kind hello, some small talk with those I know
I forget that I'm not over you for a while
A wave an easy grin, a smile to put them in
With other lives to listen to and some work I've got to do
I forget that I'm not over you for a while
Days go by with no empty feeling until I remember you're gone
People say to me, you need company
When you have some time to spend, drop around and meet a friend
They forget that I'm not over you for a while
They forget that I'm not over you for a while...
