Old Watertown, nothing much happenin', down on Main, 'cept a little rain
Old Watertown, everyone knows, the perfect crime, killin' time
And no one's goin' anywhere, livin's much too easy there
It can never be a lonely place when there's the shelter of familiar faces
Who can say it's not that way, Old Watertown, so much excitement
To be found hangin' round, there's someone standing in the rain
Waiting for the morning train, it's gonna be a lonely place
Without the look of familiar faces, but who can say it's not that way
