Moonlight mood when twilight is ending
You're in my moonlight mood and our hearts are blending
There on the same old wall that we used to know long ago
You walked there in a ribbon of moonlight
There you are as lovely as ever
You vowed by every star to love me forever
Although you're far away we meet in my solitude
You are mine when I'm in my moonlight mood...
Then in the moonlight you are mine
When I'm in my moonlight mood...
