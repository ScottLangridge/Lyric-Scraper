And here's to you, mrs. Robinson
Jilly loves you more than you will know
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh bless you please, mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey; hey, hey, hey)

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our file
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are - sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you - feel at home

The pta, mrs. Robinson
Won't ok the way you do your thing
Ding, ding, ding

And you'll get yours, mrs. Robinson
Foolin' with that young stuff like you do
Boo, hoo, hoo; woo, woo, woo

So how's your bird, mrs. Robinson
"dandy", mrs. Robinson you'd say
Hey, hey, hey

Well have you heard, mrs. Robinson
Mine is fine as wine, and I should know
Ho, ho, ho
