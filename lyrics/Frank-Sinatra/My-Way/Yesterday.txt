Yesterday
All my troubles
Seemed so far away
Now it looks
As though
They're here
To stay
Oh, I believe
In yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not
Half the man
I used to be
There's a shadow
Hanging over me
Oh, yesterday
Came suddenly

Why she
Had to go
I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said
Something wrong
Now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such
An easy game
To play
Now I need
A place
To hide away
Oh, I believe
In yesterday

Why she
Had to go
I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said
Something wrong
Now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such
An easy game
To play
Now I need
A place
To hide away
Oh, I believe
In yesterday
