A day in the life of a fool, a sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue, and hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you, coming my way
I stop just across from your door, but you're never home any more
So back to my room, and there in the gloom
I cry tears of good bye
That's the way it will be every day in the life of fool
