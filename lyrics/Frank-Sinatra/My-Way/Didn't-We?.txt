This time we almost made the pieces fit, didn't we?
This time we almost some sense of it, didn't we?
This time I have the answer right here in my hand,
Then I touched it, and it has turned to sand.
This time we almost sang the song in tune, didn't we?
This time we almost made it to the moon, didn't we?
This time, we almost made (almost made) a poem rhyme
And this time we almost made that long hard climb.
Didn't we almost make it this time... This time.
