(Gus Kahn, Matty Malneck, Frank Signorelli)

I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once used to be.

And the song birds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once Love was king
But kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart
There's such a lot
That a smile can hide
I know deep inside

I'll never be the same
Never be the same again
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart
There's such a lot
That a smile can hide
I know down deep inside

I'll never be the same
Never be the same again
