[Intro:]
I've seen that face before, that face that I see in the mirror
I know that face, I've seen that face before
I knew that dopey guy when he didn't know how to tie his tie
He stood right there and he had hair galore

The man in the looking glass, who can he be?
The man in the looking glass, can he possibly be me?
Where's our young Romeo, the lad who used to sigh?
Who's the middle-aged lothario with a twinkle in his eye?
He seem so much wiser now, less lonely but then
Could be he's only pretending again
Man in the looking glass, smiling away, how's your sacroiliac today?

Where's your first love affair, that tragedy d'amour?
The true love you thought would be the end of you for sure
Man in the looking glass, have no regrets
The man who's wise never forgets
That life is worth living if once in a while
You can look in that looking glass and smile
