Yesterdays, Yesterdays, days I knew as happy sweet sequestered days
Olden days, golden days, days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine, and truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life forsooth was mine
Sad am I, glad am I, for today I'm dreaming of, of yesterdays
Then gay youth was mine, the truth was mine
Sad am I, glad am I, for today I'm dreaming of, of yesterdays
