Look at me,
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm hanging from a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
This magic I hear,
I get misty the moment you're near
You could say that you're leading me on,
But it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see just how hopelessly I'm drawn,
That's why I'm following you
On my own, would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left,
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love
On my own would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat and my glove
I get misty and too much in love
Look at me...
