Hey, look, no crying, though she has one foot out the door
I should be crying, it ought to hurt a little more
I should resent her, try to prevent her, whatever for?

Hey, look, I knew it, she's not the type to hang around
Some day she was bound to go
With that fact in mind, my tears were never apropos

Hey. look, no sorrow, I have been luckier than most
And if tomorrow I still feel haunted by her ghost
I will remember how I loved her and how it was
Who needs crying? With those memories in tow
Me, I'm flying, I got memories to show

Hey, look, no crying
Just "Goodbye", I'm letting go
