It started out like a song
We started quiet
And slow with no surprise
Then one morning
I woke to realize
We have a good thing going

It's not
That nothing went wrong
Some angry moment of course
But just a few
And only moments
No more because we knew
We had a good thing going
And if I wanted too much
Was that such a mistake?

Half the time
You never wanted enough
Oh, wake up
I don't make that a crime
And while it's going along
You take for granted
Some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot
And still I say
It could have
Kept on growing
Instead of just kept on
We had a good thing
Going, going, gone

And if I wanted too much
Was that such a mistake?
Half the time
You never wanted enough
Oh, wake up
I don't make that a crime
And while it's going along
You take for granted
Some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot
And still I say
It could have kept on going
Instead of just kept on
We had a good thing
Going, going, gone
