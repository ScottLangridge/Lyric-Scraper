Your eyes are blue, your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can't believe that you're in love with me

You are telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind, each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me

I have always placed you far above me
I just can't imagine that you love me
After all is said and done to think that I'm the lucky one
Cannot believe that you're in love with me

I have always placed you way up there above me
Could never imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done to think that I'm the only one
I can't believe that you're in love, can't believe that you're in love
Can't believe that you're in love with me
