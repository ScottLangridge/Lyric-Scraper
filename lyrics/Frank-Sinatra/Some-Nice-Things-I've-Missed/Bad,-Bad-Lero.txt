Now the south side of Chicago is (it's) the baddest part of town
And if you (you're gonna) go down there, you better (just) beware
Of a man (cat) named Leroy Brown
Now Leroy (Brown) he's trouble, and he stands about six feet four
All the downtown ladies call him: "treetop lover," the studs they call him: "Sir"
(Yeah) He's bad, bad Leroy Brown, meanest (baddest) man (cat) in the whole damn town
Badder that old King Kong and (he's) meaner that a junkyard dog
Now Leroy he's a gambler, and he likes (digs) his (those) fancy clothes
He likes to wave his (that) (great big / big fat) (shinny) diamond ring(s)
Under (In front of) everybody's nose
He's got a custom Continental, he's got an El Dorado too
He's got a 22 (32) gun in his pocket for fun
He's got a razor in his (the razor in the) shoe
(Yeah) He's bad, bad Leroy Brown, meanest (baddest) man (cat) in the whole damn town
Badder that old King Kong, and (he's) meaner that a junkyard dog
Now Friday - 'bout a week ago, Leroy shootin' dice
And at the end (edge) of the bar, sat (was) a lady (chick) named Dorris (Morris)
Man she sure looked nice
And (Well/Then) he laid his eyes upon her,
That's when the big scene (trouble soon) began
And Leroy Brown he learned a lesson 'bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man
(Yeah) He's bad, bad Leroy Brown, meanest (baddest) man (cat) in the whole damn town
Badder that old King Kong, (and) (he's) meaner that a junkyard dog
