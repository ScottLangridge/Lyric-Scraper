What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like bein' in love

There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like bein' in love

All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringin' for me

And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peel
I would swear I was fallin'
I could swear I was fallin'
It's almost like bein' in love

Almost like bein' in love
Just like bein' in love

All the music of life seems to be
Just like a bell that is ringin' for me

And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peel
I would swear I was fallin'
I could swear I was fallin'
It's almost like bein' in love
