Grab your coat and snatch your hat, leave your worries on the doorstep
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet, on the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with the blues on parade
No longer afraid, the rover crossed over

If I never had a cent I'll be rich as Rockfeller
The gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid 'cause the rover, he got over

If I never had a cent, I'd be rich as Rockfeller
All those chicks 'round my feet on the sunny, sunny side of the street
