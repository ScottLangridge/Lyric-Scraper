It seems to me I've heard that song before
It's from an old familiar score I know it well, that melody

It's funny how a theme recalls a favorite dream
Dream that brought you so close to me

I know each word because I've heard that song before
The lyrics said, "Forevermore" Forevermore's a memory

Please have them play it again
And I'll remember just when I heard that lovely song before

It's funny how a theme recalls a favorite dream
Dream that brought you so close to me

Please have them play it again
And I'll remember just when I heard that lovely song before
