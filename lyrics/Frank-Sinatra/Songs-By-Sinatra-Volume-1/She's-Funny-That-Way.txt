I'm not much to look at, I'm nothing to see
I'm just glad I'm living, lucky to be
I've got a woman who's crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way

I can't save a dollar, I ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler, she'd live in a tent
I've got a woman, crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way

Though she loves to work and slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off if I went away

But why should I leave her?, why should I go?
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got a woman who's crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way
