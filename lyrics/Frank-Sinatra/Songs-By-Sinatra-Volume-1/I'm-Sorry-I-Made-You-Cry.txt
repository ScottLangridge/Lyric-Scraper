I'm sorry dear, so sorry dear, I'm sorry I made you cry
Won't you forget, won't you forgive, don't let us say goodbye
One little word, one little smile, one little kiss won't you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh, I'm sorry I made you cry
One little word, one little smile, one little kiss won't you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh, I'm sorry I made you cry
