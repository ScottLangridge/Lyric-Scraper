A foggy day,
In london town,
It had me low,
And it had me down
I viewed the morning,
With much alarm,
The british museum,
Had lost it's charm
How long I wondered,
Could this thing last,
But the age of miracles,
It hadnt past
And suddenly,
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy london town,
The sun was shining everywhere
