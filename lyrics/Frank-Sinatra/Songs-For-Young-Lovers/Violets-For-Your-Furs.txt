It was winter in Manhattan
Falling snow flakes filled the air
The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I learned about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just within a thrice
I bought you violets for your furs 
And it was spring for a while, remember?
I bought you violets for your furs 
And there was April in that December
The snow drifted down and the flowers
And that is where it lay
The snow looked like dew 
And the blossoms as on a summer day
I bought you violets for your furs 
And there was blue in the wintry sky
You pinned my violets to your furs 
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day I bought you violets for your furs
