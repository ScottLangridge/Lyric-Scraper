Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends but not like before
To think of what weve been
And not to kiss again

Seems like pretending
It isnt the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends but one broken heart

We loved, we laughed, we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends and were just friends

We loved, we laughed and we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends and were just friends
