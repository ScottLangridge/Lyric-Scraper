(I'll never smile again until I smile at you)
(I'll never laugh again) What good would it do?

For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

(I'll never love again, I'm so in love with you)
(I'll never thrill again to somebody new)

Within my heart
I know I will never start
(To smile again)
Until I smile at you

[instrumental]

Within my heart
I know I will never start
(To smile again)
Until I smile at you

[very brief instrumental]

(Until I smile at you)
