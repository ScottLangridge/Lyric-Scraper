What's new? How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit, lovely as ever, I must admit
What's new? How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then

Gee, but it's nice to see you again
What's new? Probably, I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand and you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand, Adieu, pardon my asking, what's new
Of course, you couldn't know, I haven't changed, I still love you so
