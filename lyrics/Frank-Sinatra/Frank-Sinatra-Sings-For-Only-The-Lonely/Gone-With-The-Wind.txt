Gone with the wind, just like a leaf that has blown away.
Gone with the wind, my romance has flown away.
Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips,
I had a lifetime of heaven on my fingertips.
But now all is gone, gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart.
Just like a flame, love burned brightly
Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone,
Gone with the wind.
