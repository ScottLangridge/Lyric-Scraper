My mama done told me, when I was in knee-pants
My mama done told me, son a womanll sweet talk
And give you the big eye but when the sweet talkins done
A womans a two-face, a worrisome thing
Wholl leave you to sing the blues in the night

Now the rains a-fallin, hear the trains a-callin', whooee
My mama done told me hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin cross the trestle, whooee
My mama done told me a-whooee ah-whooee old clickety-clacks
Echoin back the blues in the night

The evenin breeze will start the trees to cryin and the moon
Will hide its light when you get the blues in the night
And take my word, the mocking bird will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong and hes so right

From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds they might blow
I been in some big towns and I heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A womans a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who will leave you to sing the blues in the night

My mama was right, theres blues in the night
