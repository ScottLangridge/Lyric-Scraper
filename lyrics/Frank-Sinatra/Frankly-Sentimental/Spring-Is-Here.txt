Spring is here, why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here, why isn't the waltz entrancing?

No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me?

Spring is here, why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?

Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here, I hear

Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here, I hear
