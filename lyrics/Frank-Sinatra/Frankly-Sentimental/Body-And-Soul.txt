My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, just for you only,
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I spent my days in longing
And wondering why, why it's me that you're wronging?
I tell you that I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending? Because it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear...

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours just for the taking
I would gladly surrender,
Surrender myself to you, body and soul!

...

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours, I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender... Myself to you
Body and soul!...
