I can't stop lovin' you, so I've made up my mind
To live in memory of old lonesome times
I can't stop wantin' you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, yeah they make me feel blue,
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop lovin' you, yes so I've made up my mind
To live in memory of old lonesome times
I can't stop wantin' you, it's so useless to say
So I'll just live my life, live my life in dreams of yesterday.
