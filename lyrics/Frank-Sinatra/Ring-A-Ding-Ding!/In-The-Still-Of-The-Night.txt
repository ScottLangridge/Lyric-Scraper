In the still of the night as I gaze out of my window
At the moon in its flight, my thoughts all stray to you
In the still of the night while the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number when I say to you
Do you love me, as I love you
Are you my life to be that dream come true
Or will this dream of mine will it fade way out of sight
Just like that moon growing dim, on the rim of the hill
In the still, still of the night.
