When I take my sugar to tea, all the boys are jealous of me,
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes,
When I take my sugar to tea.
I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me, she's a high hat baby, that's she,
So I never take her where the gang goes,
When I take my sugar to tea.
Every Sunday afternoon, we forget about our cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz, with those millionaires.
When I take my sugar to tea, I'm as ritzy as I can be,
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes,
When I take my sugar to tea.
(musical interlude)

Every Sunday afternoon, we forget about those cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz, with those zillionaires.
When I take my sugar to tea, I'm as ritzy as I can be,
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes,
When I take, take my sugar to tea.
