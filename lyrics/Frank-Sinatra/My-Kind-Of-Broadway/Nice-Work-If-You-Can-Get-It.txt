Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it won't you tell me how?

[very brief instrumental]

Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky
[last two lines are instrumental]

And strollin' with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
[last two lines are instrumental]

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it won't you tell me how?
