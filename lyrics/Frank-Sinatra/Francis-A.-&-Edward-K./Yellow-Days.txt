I remember when the sunlight had a special kind of brightness
And laughter held a lover's kind of lightness, Yellow days, yellow days.
She would hold me and the smile would spread around us so completely
And the softness of a kiss would linger sweetly, Yellow days, yellow days.
But then came thunder and I heard her say "goodbye"
Through tears of wonder, Now I'm alone and my heart wants to know
Yellow days, where'd you go?
Life is empty and the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender
And the laughter's just an echo I'll remember Yellow days, yellow days.
Now I'm alone and my heart wants to know
Yellow days, where'd you go?
Life is empty and the sunlight seems so harsh instead of tender
And the laughter's just an echo I'll remember Yellow days, yellow days
