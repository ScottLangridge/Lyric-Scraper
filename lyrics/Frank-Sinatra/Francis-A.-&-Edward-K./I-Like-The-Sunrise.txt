I like the sunrise 'cause it brings a new day,
I like a new day, it brings new hope, they say.
I like the sunrise blazing in the new start,
Night time is weary, oh and so am I.
Every evening I wish upon a star
That my brand new bright tomorrow isn't very far.
When that heavy blue curtain of night is raised up high,
Out of sight, I like the sunrise, oh heavenly day,
I like the sunrise, I hope it lights for me

[Full musical interlude]

Every evening I wish upon a star
That my brand new bright tomorrow isn't very far.
When that heavy blue curtain of night is raised up high,
Way out of sight, I like the sunrise, so heavenly to see,
I like the sunrise, I hope it lights for me.
I hope it lights for me.
