Summer, you old indian summer
Youre the tear that comes after june-times laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when summertime was new

You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken
Youre the ghost of a romance in june going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
Farewell  to you, indian summer

You are here to watch over
A heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken
Youre the ghost of a romance in june going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
Farewell  to you, indian summer

You old indian summer
