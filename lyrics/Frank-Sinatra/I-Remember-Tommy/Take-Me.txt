Take me, I'm yours if you'll take me, I want you to make me a part of your heart.
And hold me, I dreamed you would hold me, now really enfold me, say we'll never part.
All the love I have to give, I want to give to you,
And as long as I shall live, I'll only live for you,
Take me, and never forsake me,
My darling, please take me and make your own, and make me your own.
