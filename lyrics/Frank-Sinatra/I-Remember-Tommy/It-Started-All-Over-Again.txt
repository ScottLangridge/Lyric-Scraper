It started all over again the moment I looked in your eyes
It started all over again, the thrill we can never disguise
The day that we parted, so broken hearted, will never return again
Dreams I've delayed, promises made are starting anew just for you

It started all over again the moment I held you so tight
It started all over again when we kissed away the night till dawn's early light
Now we're together, sweethearts forever, we'll build our romance anew
It started all over again the moment I looked at you

It started all over again the moment I held you so tight
It started all over again when we kissed away the night, the dawn's early light
Now we're together, sweethearts forever, we'll build our romance anew
It started all over again the moment I looked at you
