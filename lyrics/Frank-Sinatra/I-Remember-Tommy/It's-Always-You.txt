Whenever it's early twilight, I watch till a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see, it's always you.
Whenever I roam through roses, and lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch, it's always you
If a breeze, caresses me, it's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody, it's merely the way you sigh
Wherever you are you're near me, you dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love, it's always you
