In the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much, a word, a smile and a kiss
When a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realize

She may be weary, women do get weary, wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness
She may be waiting, just anticipating things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care
And a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear
You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness and it's all so easy, try a little tenderness
