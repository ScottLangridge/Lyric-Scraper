The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain
No more strain
Now I'm sane
But I'd rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur of cat and cur
The fine mismating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson
But I wish I were in love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words, "I love you 'til the day I die"
The self deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care
No, no despair
Now I'm all there now
But I'd rather be punched, drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet
And I wish I were in love again
In love again, in love again
