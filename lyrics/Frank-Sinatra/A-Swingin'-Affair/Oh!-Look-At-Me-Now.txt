I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
I never cared much
Oh, look at you now! 

I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
I never knew much

Oh, look at you now! 

You're a new man better than Casanova at his best

With a new heart and a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

So you're the guy who turned out a lover

Yes I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things

But, look at you now! 

He's not the guy who cared about love
And he's not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
He never cared about much
But, look at him now! 

I'm a lover.

He never knew the technique of kissing
He never knew the thrill he could get from her touch
He never knew much
But, look at him now! 

He's a new man better than Casanova at his best
With a new start and a brand new heart

He's so proud he's bustin' his vest

So he's the guy who turned out a lover
So he's the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things

But, look at me now! 

He's a new man better than Casanova at his best
With a new start and a brand new heart

I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

He's a lover
Yes, we know he's a lover, yes

I laughed at those blue diamond rings
Just one of those things

But, look at him now! 

Jack, I'm ready! 

Look at him now!
