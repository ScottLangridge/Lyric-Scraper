What now my love, now that you've left me, how can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn to ashes, and my hopes turn to bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel, now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night, without a goal, stripped of my heart and my soul
What now my love, now that it's over, I feel the world falling all around me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me, there's the sky, where that sea should be
What now my love, now that you're gone, I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry, if I should live if I should live or die
What now my love, now there is nothing, only my last, my last good-bye
