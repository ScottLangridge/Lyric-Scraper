"That's life!" (That's life)
That's what all the people say.
You're ridin' high in April,
Shot down in May.
But I know I'm gonna change that tune,
When I'm back on top, back on top in June.

I said that's life (That's life)
And as funny as it may seem.
Some people get their kicks,
Stompin' on a dream;
But I don't let it, let it get me down,
'Cause this fine, ol' world,
It keeps spinnin' around.

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,
A pawn, and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out,
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face,
I pick myself up and get back in the race!

That's life! (That's life)
I tell ya, I can't deny it.
I thought of quittin', baby,
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try,
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly.

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,
A pawn, and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out,
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face,
I just pick myself up and get back in the race!

That's life! (That's life)
That's life, and I can't deny it!
Many times I thought of cuttin' out,
But my heart won't buy it.
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July,
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die!

My, my!
