To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
(1)To be better far than you are(1)
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
(2)To be willing to give when there's no more to give (2)
(3)To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live (3)
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars,
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star

[Notes:]
The Broadway cast's version is quite similar with a few exceptions:
(1)To love pure and chaste from afar
(2)To fight for the right without question or pause
(3)To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause
