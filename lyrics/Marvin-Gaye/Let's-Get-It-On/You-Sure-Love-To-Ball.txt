"You sure love to ball"-  marvin gaye
(the real lyrics as Marvin sings it)

Oh baby, please turn yourself around
Oh baby, so I can love you girl
Oh baby, I'll make you feel so good
Oh suga... just like you want me to

Oh baby, you sure love to ball
Oh baby, you sure love to ball

Oh honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Oh baby baby
Don't ever go away
Oh stay with me baby... I'll love you night and day

Oh baby, you sure love to ball
Oh honey, you sure love to ball

Oh...now.... I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
Ah, there's no doubts oh baby
That you're my foxy lady

Oh baby, you sure love to ball
Oh suga, you sure love to ball

Oh...all I know now baby,
Hey baby, is love you some more...
Oh, come on in...and let me love you
Aww baby, climb the wall

Oh, oh, oh baby, you sure love to ball
Oh lady, you sure love to ball

Awww....

Pretty little s*** baby, you sure love to ball
Pretty little s*** mama, you sure love to ball
Pretty little s*** baby, you sure love to ball
Pretty little s*** mama, you sure love to ball
Pretty little s*** baby, you sure love to ball
Pretty little s*** mama, you sure love to ball

All night long...(debatable)

Oh I know, if we ever part
Oh that one thing would surely break my heart
I gotta get ready for my baby

Oh baby, you sure love to ball
Oh baby, you sure love to ball

(give all your love to me...pretty little s*** mama you sure love to ball...pretty little s*** mama you sure love to ball...give all your love to me....)
