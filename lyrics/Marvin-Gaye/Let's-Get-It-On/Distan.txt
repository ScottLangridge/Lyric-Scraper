You know, when you're in love and your lover leaves you
And you've got nobody, the lonely hours over here
Sittin' home and thinkin', you say:

Distant Lover, Lover
Ooh, So many miles away ooh heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day.

Distant Lover! Oooh lover you should think about me say a prayer
For me. Please Please baby think about me sometime, think about me yeah.
Hey in Misery, Misery

As I reminisce, ooh baby through our joyful summer together, the promises we made of the daily letter, then all of a sudden everything seemed to explode. Now I gaze out my window sugar down the lonesome road.

Distant lover ooh ooh sugar, how can you treat my heart so mean and cruel, don't you know sugar that every moment that I spent with you I treasured it like it was a precious jewel. Oooh Baby

Lord have mercy!

Ooh baby don't go, please come back baby.
Something I wanna say, when you left you took all of me with you now lord I wonder do you wanna hear me scream and plead. Please, please come back home girl, please baby come back home.

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Ooo, something I wanna say
When you left to go away
No 'ther do I want, do you wanna have me plead and scream
Please! Please, oh please baby
Come back home, girl
Oh baby, come back
Oh oh
