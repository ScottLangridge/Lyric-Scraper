I've been really tryin baby
Tryin to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on, oh come on, ooh

Let's get it on, ow baby
Let's get it on, let's love baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, woo

We're all sensitive people with so much to give
Understanding sugar
Since we got to be, let's live, I love you
There's nothin' wrong with me lovin' you, baby no no
And givin' yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby ooh

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be, ooh ooh
I'm askin' you baby to get it on with me, ooh ooh ooh
I ain't goin' to worry, I ain't goin' to push, won't push you baby
So come on come on come on come on come on baby
Stop beatin' round the bush, hey

Let's get it on, ooh ooh
Let's get it on, you know what I'm talkin' about
Come on baby, hey hey, let your love come out
If you believe in love let's get it on, ooh
Let's get it on baby, this minute, oh yeah
Let's get in on ee___
Please get it on, hey hey
Come on come on come on come on come on darlin'
Stop beatin'round the bush, oh, gonna get it on
Beggin'you baby I want to get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you, let me groove you
Good, let your love come down, oh
Get it on, come on baby, do you know I mean it

Girl you give me good feelings, so good
Somethin' like summer time
