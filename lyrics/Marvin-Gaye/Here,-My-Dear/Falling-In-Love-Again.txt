In this life.... Of.... Happiness and sadness
When you've lost.... Out on love...
And it all... Ends up in madness
And you say.... Love.... Please go away don't torture me, night and day
Then someone real..... Someone who feel comes in.

Chorus
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody, she says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
Once again........ Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...
She's so wonderful..... I tried not to let my heart step in.......
But what to do... Baby... What could I...... Do......
When somebody  real comes in.....
Someone who feel...... Comes in........

Chorus
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody,  she says she love me
I'm falling in love again.... Awwww beautiful woman
Falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love

Music plays
I......... Love........ You...........
