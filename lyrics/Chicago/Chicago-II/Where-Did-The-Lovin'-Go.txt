I recall the look in your eyes, and the way that I felt
When I heard you say,
"Where did the loving go?"
Funny how it all slipped away.

I remember all that we had, 'cause our love was so right,
And so very strong.
I would give anything,
Knowing where we might have gone wrong.

I recall the moment you said,
"It doesn't work anymore,
And it's come to the end. "
I would do anything babe just to see you again.

I remember all that we had,
And it's so very sad
When there's nothing to say.
(Background:) Gonna say,
Where did the lovin' go?
Funny how it all slipped away.

Something's coming over me now,
Something that I don't understand,
But I would give all the world if I could have you back again.

I want to make it publicly clear,
I'm never gonna make it from here.
I can only say that I love you, woh.

I just want you to know that I love you, yes I do
