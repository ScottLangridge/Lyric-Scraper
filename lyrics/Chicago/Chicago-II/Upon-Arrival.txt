A chauffeur dressed in gray, holds a sign, in leather gloves,
With instructions to meet the vip upon arrival.
Father, mother, and sister trading smiles and playful shoves;
And their son is coming back home, coming to stay, ooh, woh, woh;

A lovely teenage queen stands there, waits for the boy she loves;
And she dreams of the summertime with him, upon arrival.
Now announcing the touchdown of the flight, it's right on time;
And a wave of excitement sweeps the room, ooh, woh, woh; ooh, woh, woh.

Bridge:
Each second of every minute seems eternal, time standing still;
Hearts beating quicker, minds racing fast.
Then suddenly shouts of laughter, tears of joy, flashes of light;
Handshake, introductions, lover's kiss.

Now, as the people go separate ways, I stand amazed;
Everyone has a story you could tell, upon arrival.
Still a girl in dark glasses waits until everyone's gone.
And she weeps, she's all alone, her love is lost, ooh, woh, woh; ooh, woh,
Woh.
