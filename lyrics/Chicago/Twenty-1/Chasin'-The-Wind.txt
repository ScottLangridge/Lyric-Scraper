Did the best I could
To make you mine
If you ever felt anything for me
Well, you never gave a sign
Thought time would make you change
Make you want me
But baby I never had a chance
Now I know that there's just some things
Just not meant to be

[Chorus:]
No use
Thinking you'd care about me
No way
That I'm gonna win
Oh darlin'
I might as well be
Chasin' the wind
Oh, I'm just
Chasin' the wind

Opened up my heart
Let you inside
If love was what you were lookin' for
Well, I guess it wasn't mine
So I guess I better go
It's over and done
But you know I'm not really sad at all
'Cause you can't really say it's over
When it never had begun

[Chorus:]

Can't reach the sea
If you can't get past the sand
Can't touch the sky
If you can't reach up your hand
Can't give if you give nothing back

[Chorus:]
