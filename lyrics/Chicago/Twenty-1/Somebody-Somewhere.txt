The sun is coming up
But I don't see the light
I keep goin' on and on
Thinking 'bout where we went wrong
I've always heard that love
Could stand the test of time
But somethin' that we had is gone
Maybe we just stayed too long
I wish that I could lie
And tell myself it's alright
It was nothing at all
[Chorus:]
Somebody, somewhere
Is falling in love tonight
Is it nothing at all
Somebody, somewhere
Is saying their last goodbyes
I gotta know
Is it the same when it comes
And when love goes

Where do I go from here
Don't know where to turn
Will you find another face
Or disappear in yesterday
Should I hold on
Should I let all the memories go
Was it nothing at all
[Chorus:]
She comes and goes...
[Chorus:]
