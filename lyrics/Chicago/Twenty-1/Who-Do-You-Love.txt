I never know
What you're gonna do
You're always so far away
Down below
You used to tell the truth
Now you're lookin' for something to say
You give me those eyes
And then look away
Do you want me down on my knees
Are you livin' a lie
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please
Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come
Right out and say
(Chorus)
Who do you love
What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love
I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love

I wish that you'd lie
Or tell me the truth
So I can decide for myself
Maybe you've tried
What we used to do
With somebody, somewhere else
Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come
Right out and say
(Chorus)
