Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Should I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

[Chorus:]
But if angels come to say
I might live another day
Then down on my knees I'll pray
Blessed Savior guide my way

God bless mom and daddy too
Wish that I was there with you
Grandma and brother, dear
Missed you these many years

[Chorus:]

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
