She said, "it's lonely here tonight." she's always sad when she's alone.
She said, "i need you here tonight." she couldn't wait 'til I get home.
She loves me, and that's all I need to know.
She's part of my life; just a part I won't let go.
Then she said,

"love me tomorrow. Won't you please promise me? Love me tomorrow like today.
Love me tomorrow; hurry back. Can't you see I need you much more than
Yesterday? "

You know it's always cold at night; it's always lonely 'til the dawn.
And though it's not what we both want, knowing she's there, i'll carry on.
Because she loves me, and that's all I need to know.
She's part of my life; just a part I won't let go.
Then she said,

"love me tomorrow. Won't you please promise me? Love me tomorrow like today.
Love me tomorrow; hurry back. Can't you see I need you more than any words can
Say? "
