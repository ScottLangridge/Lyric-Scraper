She said, "Tell me what it's all about."
I said "Why, why, why?
It's just something you could do without.
You better try, try try. "
She said, "I can't reach you on the telephone.
I can't call you when you're not at home.
You keep saying that you're all alone.
That's a lie, lie, lie. "

Bad advice,
Has me down and undone.
Got to try again,
To believe in myself
Look at me,
I'm alone in the end.
Can you see me falling, falling down?

I said, "Mama Can you get it straight?"
She said "Why, why, why?"
"I wanna tell you that it just can't wait, so let's try, try, try"
She said, "I don't care where you might have gone.
I don't care 'cause you've done me wrong.
You been doin' it far too long,
So goodbye, bye, bye. "
