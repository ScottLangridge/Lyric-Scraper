You had it so good for so long
You thought you were so very strong
You had too much glory
Just a little too much too soon

You thought you could never be wrong
She would always buy your song
What a sad, sad story
It's an age old story

Every man will get his chance to play the fool
Every time he takes the chance and thinks he's cool

Sonny think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
And you don't know what to do
When it all comes down to you

If you're so afraid to be loved
Because you see too much
What a sad, sad story
But you brought it upon yourself

If they'd been all up for fun
Now you got nowhere to run
With your sad, sad story
It's an age old story

Every man will get his chance to play the fool
Every time he takes the chance and thinks he's cool

Sonny think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
Sonny think twice

Now you don't know what to do
When it all comes down to you

Don't think that she don't care
'Bout your Saturday night affair
And you better watch out
Somebody is gonna be there

Sonny think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone

Sonny think twice
Before you close the door
Take my advice
Your love can't take much more
Something about your life is wrong
When the lady who loves you more is gone
