Used to think that you'd do anything for me.
I thought your heart was pounding at my door.
Now it seems that things aren't right.
You've been crying ev'ry night.
You're rainy season just ain't slowing down.
I still love you even though there's things you can't explain.
I don't want to know if you've been lying all along.

You've been running away. Now you've run out of places to hide.
I can no longer stand here waiting for you to decide
If there's a heart still left inside.
There's someone watching tonight.

You've been trying for some time to get away from me.
It's just the same old game you've tried before.
We've talked it out a thousand time. It's still the same old useless lines.
You've made your point now why can't I make mine?
I still love you even though there's things you can't explain.
I don't want to know if you've been lying all this time.

You've been running away. Now you've run out of places to hide.
I can no longer stand here waiting for you to decide
If there's a heart still left inside.
You can't get away. There's someone watching tonight.
