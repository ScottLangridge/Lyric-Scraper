Lonely nights, empty days
Use me up so many ways
You came along and stole my heart away
I just wanna hold you darlin', tonight
Knowin' that the love between us was right
I can't believe that you'd ever let me go (oh, no)

What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm so in love with you
Got to be strong
But for how long must I have this feeling
It won't go away

Take me back to yesterday
I just wanna fade away
Closer to you, then what we used to be (Mmm Hmm)
Are we really gonna let it die
Close the book and give it one more try
I can't believe that you'd ever let me go (oh, no)

What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm so in love with you
Got to be strong (I got to be strong)
But for how long must I have this feeling
It won't go away

What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm so in love with you
Got to be strong (I got to be strong)
But for how long must I have this feeling

What can I say (Ooo ooo ooo)
I'm so in love with you
Got to be strong (I got to be strong)
But for how long must I have this feeling
It won't go away
