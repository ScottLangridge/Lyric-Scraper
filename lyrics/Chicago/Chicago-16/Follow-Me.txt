One shoe on; one shoe off.
Nothin' in life is decideable; wouldn't you know.
Nothing's supposed to be easy.
Take one day at a time. Ain't no need to hurry.
Realize where you are, and where you're going to.

Chorus:
Follow me, ain't no need to go on all by yourself.
Follow me; don't need nobody else.
Follow me; and together we'll build a better life.
Follow me.

One more time; toe the line;
Nothing in life is impossible. Both of us know
Life is as good as we make it.
Dark reflections of the past
Drown in our tomorrows.
Time to laugh; time to love;
Time to live again.

Chorus

Time to laugh; time to live again.
