Don't turn away
'cause there is something I just wanna say:
I need you to stay.
Don't ask me why
'cause I don't even know
How I gave you my heart; I gave it all to you.
Now there's no way that I can lose.

Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever.
With every little moment we can share,
Gonna let you know how much I care;
I'll always be there.

Don't walk away
'cause there is something I just gotta say:
I love you today.
Just ask me why,
You're all I'll ever need
Now that you're in my life
I really think you shoul know
That I never wanna let you go.

Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever.
With every little moment we can share,
Gonna let you know how much I care;
Love lift us away.

We can last forever.

[Chorus repeats one more time]
