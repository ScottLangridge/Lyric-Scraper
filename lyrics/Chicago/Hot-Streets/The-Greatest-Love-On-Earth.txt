It's a long distance love affair
Tender are the moments that they rarely share
They hope their time will come someday
When together with the fraulein they'll steal away

It's the greatest love on earth
He's come from so far away to see
Is this his lifelong dream or just a fantasy

He's dying inside dying of frustration reaching out in hope
And he wants so hard to hide inside of her soul
'Cause that's what he needs to cope

It's the greatest love on earth
Her lovin' eyes are all he wants to see
And he knows that in her heart there lies his destiny

When she holds him in her arms he can feel the warmth
Of her gentle ways
And when she kissed him it was just like making music
That no one else will ever play

It's the greatest love on earth
He's come from so far away to see
Is this his lifelong dream or just a fantasy

It's the greatest love on earth
He's come from so far away to see
Is this his lifelong dream or just another fantasy
