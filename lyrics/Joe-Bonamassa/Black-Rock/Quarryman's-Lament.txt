I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby
I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby

Precious night, corner of the valley, listen to the wind scene
But you were not the one who was shattered
Now your calling back to me
I've been gone, who knows where
My life will lead, I give you all my love
All my soul, now I'm growing cold

I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby
I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby

Holding down, trying to tell myself life is what it seems
So you want that bad ass house that means nothing to me
You couldn't make up your mind, when we slept in the same bed
Now your back, now your crying
Tell me it's all in my head

I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby
I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby

Yea tonight all about forgiveness, that's what you see
But you refuse to answer, make peace for what you did
Broken hearts don't matter, gonna live my life instead
I was always there for you, but you left me feeling dead

I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby
I'm gonna leave my home, I ain't gonna see my baby
