Nobody's left to love me
So I wander this earth alone
Nobody's left to love me
So I wander this earth alone
Ain't got no money babe
No place to call my own

I'm going to leave you here now
Sure it's on the beach of something
I'm off to find fortune and fame
I'm as serious as a loaded gun

Nobody's left to love me
So I wander this earth alone
But I ain't got no money babe
No place to call my own
Ooo yeaahh! 

Mother earth comes calling
As I lye here dead at night
I guess my gun was loaded
I saw the flash with my own eyes
Now that my wandering is over
Ooo I wish I had more time
