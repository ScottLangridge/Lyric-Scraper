I used to work and take the salary
In a home up near a factory
But it did not take me too long
To lace up my boots and say, so long
Long Spanish boots on a so long

I took a day job in Bethlehem
I nearly threw in the towel
But it did not take me too long
To lace up my boots and say, so long
High Spanish boots on a so long, hey, yeah

I took a Spanish haberdashery
Restored it with 15th century tapestry
Oh, Mr. Nesbitt got the best of me
So I strapped on my boots and said, so long
Laced up my high boots and so long, yeah
