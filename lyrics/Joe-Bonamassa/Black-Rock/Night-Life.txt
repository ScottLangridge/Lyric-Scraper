When the evening, evening sun goes down
You're gonna find me somewhere hanging around, yeah
But the night life ain't no good life
But it is my life, yes, it is

Oh, many people just like you and me
They be a dreaming of old used to be's
Saying the night life ain't no good life
Hey, but it's my life

Oh, listen to the blues
Listen to the way they're playing
Yeah, listen to the blues
Listen to what they're saying

Night life, baby, is just another scene
In this old world, world of broken dreams
I've said that the night life ain't no good life
Hey, but it is my life

I've said that the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life, hey, yeah
I've said that the night life ain't no good life, people
But it's my life, ooh, yeah

My life, yes, it is
