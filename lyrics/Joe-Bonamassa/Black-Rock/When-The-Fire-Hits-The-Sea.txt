I'm no candle that can be blowin out in the wind
I'm no suffering like, the game I'm in
I'm no street walker, I got fire and brimstone
Sorry to disturb you, and your happy home

*All bets are off now, when the fire hits the sea
I'm gonna lay it on you child, bring it all to me

I'm no penny pusher still have my pride
I did you wrong baby, took you for a ride
I'm no rosetta stone, I learned my lessons
By the way baby thank you for the sessions

*Repeat

I'm no carpet that you can walk all over
When I say it's done baby, I mean it's over
I don't know a bottle not filled with wine
I moved down to the quarry and I did my time

*Repeat

Bring it all to me, when the fire hits the sea
