Three times a fool and I love you so
Time went on and I had to let you go
But I'm trying real hard
Baby it's so hard to do... 

It's so hard to be nice
When you treat me the way you do.

You've never been loved like I love you now
Mistreat me baby but I love you anyhow
'Cause I'm trying real hard
Baby it's so hard to do... 
 
Baby it's so hard to be nice
When you treat me the way you do

Might not be a bad thing to bring some change
Might bring sunshine and it might bring rain
'Cause I'm trying real hard
Baby it's so hard to do... 

Baby it's so hard to be nice
When you treat me the way you do
