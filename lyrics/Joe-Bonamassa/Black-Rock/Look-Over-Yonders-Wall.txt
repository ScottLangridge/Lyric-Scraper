Look over yonder's wall, hand me down my walking cane
Look over yonder's wall, hand me down my walking cane
Yes I'm lookin out your window, here comes your man

Darlin I know your man went to war
Leave you was kinda rough, I don't know how many men he killed
But I believe it was enough
Look over yonder's wall, hand me down my walking cane
Yes I'm lookin out your window, here comes your man

Well I know your man went to war
Leave you was kinda rough, I don't know how many men he killed
But it was enough
Look over yonder's wall, hand me down my walking cane
Yes I'm lookin out your window, here comes your man

Look over yonder's wall, hand me down my walking cane
Look over yonder's wall, hand me down my walking cane
Yes I'm lookin out your window, here comes your man
