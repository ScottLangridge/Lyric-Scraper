I'm so down and blue
On this as black as night
I have evil, evil on my mind
I am the ghost of the man that stands before you
Painting the silver line, nothing left to do

Blue and Evil
Gonna make a wreck of me
Blue and evil

So I take a drink, ease my evil mind
Love brings a sadness, felt at the break of day
Like climbing this mountain, trying to break away
Between the truth and the stone, lies reciprocity
A new day brings rising, but now I'm getting mean

Blue and Evil
Gonna make a wreck of me
Blue and evil

So I take a drink, ease my evil mind

See nothing but colors light through a broken glass
Now it's time for reckoning, I know you didn't read
The way the life is down on me, I can hardly breath

Blue and Evil
Gonna make a wreck of me
Blue and evil

I'm only and I hate it child

Blue and Evil
Gonna make a wreck of me
Blue and evil

Ooo so I take a drink and ease my evil mind
Gonna make a mess of me
Blue and evil
Blue and evil
Blue and evil
Blue and evil
