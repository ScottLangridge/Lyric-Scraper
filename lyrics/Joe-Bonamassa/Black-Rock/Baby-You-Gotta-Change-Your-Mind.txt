Baby if you think I'm crazy about you
You gotta change your mind (x2)

I woke up this morning 'bout half past four
Somebody knocking at my back door
If you think I'm crazy about you
You gotta change your mind
You better change your mind

*Repeat

Whatcha doin mama, you'll do it again
I'm setting out bout half past ten
If you think I'm crazy about you
You gotta change your mind
I mean you better change your mind

*Repeat

In front of the jury with my eyes full of tears
For beatin up my gal I got forty five years
If you think I'm crazy about you
You gotta change your mind
I mean you better change your mind

*Repeat

My gal likes liquor, like rye and gin
But can't get a whisky drink, but man, she thinks she
Can
If you think I'm crazy about you
You gotta change your mind
I mean, you better change your mind

Repeat
