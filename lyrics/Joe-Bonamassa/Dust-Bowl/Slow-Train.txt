There? S a slow train coming
It? S movin? On down the line
Steel wheels on iron rails
Tonight I? M fixin? To die
Woo, I hope you don? T mind pretty mama
Woo-hoo, hope you don? T mind if I go

? Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I ain? T gonna see you anymore

There? S a slow train coming
Coming right on time
Smokestacks and bottle lightning
This jumper on the line
Woo, I can? T do without it anymore pretty mama
Yes, I can? T do it without it anymore

? Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I ain? T gonna see you anymore

There? S a slow train coming
To march us home from war
With my leather boots and my haversack
Sure can take it no more
Woo, I cried for her baby when I saw you there
Woo-hoo, I cried for her just the same

? Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I? M gonna cry for you just the same

Well there? S a slow train coming
Carrying the mighty worker hordes
Eighteen days in the cotton field
Enough to put a man out of [?]
Woo, It? S time to move on pretty mama
Woo-hoo, Yes it? S time to move on as I go

As the steam from my slow train rises
It? S time for me to get on board
