"You know I Wish I was in Richmond
You know I Do, I wish I was Back Home
You know I Wish I was in Richmond
The Land I was Raised, The Place I've Always Known

And now I'm waiting in New York City
The Rain is Falling, No one seems to see
And all The Salesman, They take Notice
Forget the rushing lives, For the rushing brides to be

You know I Wish I was in Richmond
You know I Do, I Wish I was Back Home

She Didn't Change Me, She Forgave Me
So now it's Time, Time For Me to Leave
Like Broken Glass in my Broken Hands
I'm Broken Down, This I Do Believe

You know I Wish I was in Richmond
You know I Do I Wish I was Back Home
You know I Wish I was in Richmond
The Land I was Raised, The Place I've Always known

As a Frost Comes, I've Learned Some
Not to Make the same Mistakes Again
Laws are Learned, As Rule Books Burn
But what I do know, Leads to still my Friend

I'm Going Back, Back to Richmond
You know I am, You know I'm Going Home
I'm Going Back, Back to Richmond
The Land I was Raised, The Place That I Call Home"
