Sloe Gin, sloe Gin
Tryin' to wash away the pain inside
Well I'm sick and I'm all done in
And I'm standing in the rain
And I feel like I'm gonna cry

I'm so damn lonely
And I ain't even high
I'm so damn lonely
And I feel like I'm gonna die

Mayday, mayday I've been shot down
Over the stormy sea
Well I feel that I'm drifting away
Can not seem to get a grip on me
Well. I can't even try

I'm so damn lonely
Ain't even high
I hate to go home alone,
But what else is new?
I'm so damn lonely

I hate to go home alone,
But what else is new?
I'm so damn lonely...

You stand and bleeding people pass me by
No matter if you live
No matter if you die

Sloe Gin, sloe Gin
Tryin' to wash away the pain inside
Well I'm sick and I'm all done in
I'm standing in the rain
And I feel like I'm gonna cry

I'm so damn lonely
Ain't even high
I'm so damn lonely...
