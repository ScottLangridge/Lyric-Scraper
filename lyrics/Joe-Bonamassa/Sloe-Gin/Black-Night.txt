No one Care's about me, No I ain't even got a Friend
Well my Baby's gone and left me, When will my Troubles
End
Black Night is Falling, Oh I hate to be alone
Well I'm crying for my Baby, Another day is Gone

Got no one to talk with, To tell my Troubles to
I Don't even know the Minute Baby since I Lost You
Black Night is Falling, Oh and I hate to be alone
Well I'm Crying for my Baby, Another day is Gone

Well my Mother Had the troubles, My Father had them too
My Brother Slipped away yeah, And I Don't even know what
To do
Black Night is Falling yeah, Oh I hate to be alone
Well I'm Crying for my Baby, Well I'm Crying for my Baby
Another Day is Gone"
