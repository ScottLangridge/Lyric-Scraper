Seagull, you fly 'cross the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asked you where you are going
Nobody knows where you're from

There is a man asking a question
Is it a really the end of the world?
Seagull, you must have known for a long time
The shapes of things to come

Now you fly through the sky
Never asking why
And you fly all around
Until somebody shoots you down

Seagull you fly 'cross the horizon
Into the misty morning sun
Nobody asked you where you are going
Nobody knows where you're from

Now you fly through the sky
Never asking why
And you fly all around
Until somebody shoots you down

Gonna fly away tomorrow, fly away
Leave it to my sorrow, hey yeah
Gonna fly away
Leave it to my sorrow, hey yeah
