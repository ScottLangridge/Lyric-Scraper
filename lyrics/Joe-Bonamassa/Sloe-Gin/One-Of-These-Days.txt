One of these days boy, I'm gonna see my woman
I'm gonna see my children, children on their knee
Gonna run up to my woman, and hold her in my arms
With tears in her eyes, she said I'm glad you're free

She's coming down the road boy, I said she's coming down the road
She's got her Red dress on, yeah she's got her Red dress on
She's coming down the road boy, with her bags down low
Said she's coming down the road boy, 
She's got her bags down low, hey yeah

Oh One of these days, I'll be coming home soon girl
, I'll be coming on home
One of these days boy, I'll be coming on home

One of these days boy, I'm gonna see my baby
Gonna see my baby, coming down the road
Gonna have my Pardon, Pardon in her Apron oh Lord
Wanna see The Governer, she said Release my Man

Hey One of these days, I'll be coming home soon girl
, I'll be coming on home
I'll be coming down the road boy, with my bags down low
One of these days boy, I'll be coming on home
