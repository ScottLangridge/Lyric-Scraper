Hey Mr. Jelly Roll Baker
Can I please be your slave
When I'm dead and gone
I'm gonna rise up from the grave

For your sweet jelly roll
The best jelly roll in town
You're the only man baking
And I'm gonna keep my damper down

Well can I place an order
For three weeks ahead
I'd rather have my jellies
Than some old big bed

'cause I'm crazy 'bout that jelly
The best jelly roll in town
You're the only man baking
And I'm gonna keep you're damper down

You can take all my women
You can talk even more
I gotta brand new secret
You can't catch at all

I'm a jelly roll baker
I bake the best jelly roll in town
I'm the only man baking 
And I'm gonna keep my damper down
I'm the only man baking
And I'm gonna keep my damper down
