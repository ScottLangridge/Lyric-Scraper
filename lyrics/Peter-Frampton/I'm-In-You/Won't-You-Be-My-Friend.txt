(How do you feel)
(Feel good)
(How do you think I feel)
(Bloody fantastic)

Oh listen hard for a year
There was a time
They were just feet
They made me come alive
You got the chance of a lifetime
At the mall
I played awhile
Yeah (don't be sad)
Lay low, lay low
They got me up to play
Then I dropped my guitar (yeah yeah)
Played it wrong
48 hours
Walking
Pool table
Bathroom to bathroom
Almost missed the gate (yes I did)
Never seem to make it

Won't you be my friend
Don't you understand
Won't you be my friend
Don't you see what you have done
Won't you be my friend
Don't you understand by now
Won't you be my friend
Don't you see what you have done
(Ooh) ooh

Sit alone in the front room
Steel in my hand
Play along for days and nights
Never saw home

We can be such friends
Don't you see by now
We can be such friends
Don't you see what you have done
We can be such friends
Don't you see by now
We can be such friends
Don't you see what you have done
Night after night
Yeah

(Be my friend)
(Won't you be)
(oh oh  yeah)
Pass it on

Ooooohhh

If you got the chance, got the chance
What you got, got the chance, got the chance

Listen hard for a year
Or was it five
They were just feet
They make me come alive
(Hit) hit the coast
To give you understand
Spent the night feeling grand

We can be such friends
Don't you understand by now
We can be such friends
Don't you see by now
We can be such friends
Don't you understand
We can be such friends
Don't you know what you have done
Oh yeah
Won't you be my friend (Won't you be my)
Don't you understand
Won't you be my friend (Wanna be my)
Don't you see what you have done
Won't you be my friend (Won't you be my)
Don't you understand
Won't you be my friend (Gotta be my friend)
Don't you see what you have done
Now I see one friend (Wanna be your friend)
Don't you realize
Now I feel were friends (Wanna be your friend)
Don't you see what you have done
Now I feel we're friends
Don't you understand
Cause we could be such friends
Don't you see the way I feel
I can play, I can play all night
Play all night
Play all night
