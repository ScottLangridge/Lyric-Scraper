When we walk alone
Rocky and me
So mutch fun
Rocky's hot club
You can join with me
Rocky's hot club
Won't you be with me

He can't be anything more than me
I'm a reflection (I'm a reflection)
He's a reflection of me
Oh oh, oh oh

Rocky's hot club
You can join right now
Rocky's hot club
You can join right now

Christmas eve
Who knew, that you'd be there
I heard you cry
Could it be
Rocky my man
Always heard about you
Never thought I'd have
You for me
Rocky, my man

Rocky's hot club
You can join with me
Rocky's hot club
Won't you be with me (with me)
Rocky's hot club
You can join right now (right now)
Rocky's hot club
Join right now
Rocky's hot club
You can join with me
Rocky's hot club
Be with me, be with me
Rocky's hot club
You can join right now
Rocky's hot club
Be with me
He's my friend
