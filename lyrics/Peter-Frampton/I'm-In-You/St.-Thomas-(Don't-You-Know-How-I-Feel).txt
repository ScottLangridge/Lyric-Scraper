When I call your name, girl
Please don't feel no pain
When I call your name, girl
Please don't feel no pain

I'm gonna win ya
Don't you see by now
Baby I know, gotta go
Ooh don't you know
Don't you feel so hurt, girl
Nowhere to hide
When you're feeling hurt, girl
There's no place to hide, yeah
When you feel like I do today
Ooh this way
When you feel today
Oh baby I know what you feel
Right now, oh

When you saw the sun, girl
Didn't you think it would work
When you saw the moon, girl
Night time couldn't fail
Ah when you wanna be, wanna be
You wanna be on your own
Don't you know how I feel, feel girl
Don't you know how I feel
Don't you know how I feel
Higher, higher I wanna be
Don't you know how I feel
Don't you know how I feel
If it's real and it's real
Know how I feel, tried so hard
