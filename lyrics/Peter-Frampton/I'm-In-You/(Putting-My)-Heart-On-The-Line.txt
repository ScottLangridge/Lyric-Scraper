Ooh ooh ooh

I could be happy sitting alone
Walking on my own
I need you, Lord knows why
I can live without you

Putting my heart on the line
You know I am, show me a sign
Putting my heart on the line
Yeah ah ah

Coming from my heart, over to you
Don't you understand
You can be me now, just a day
Don't you know that I love you

Putting my heart on the line
You know I am
Give me a sign I want a sign
Putting my heart on the line
Cause I need you
Yeah ah ah oh ah oh oh

Think, thinking of you
(Thinking of you, yeah)
Gotta be free,  don't you see
I don't need no (bullshit)

Putting my heart on the line
You can, please show me that sign
Putting my heart on the line
Right now for me
Putting my heart on the line
You gotta show me that sign
Show me that sign in your eyes
Putting my heart on the line
Once more with you

You want to wear my heart (you want to wear my heart)
Take it from where starts (where it starts)
Putting my heart on the line
Today, always (always with you)
