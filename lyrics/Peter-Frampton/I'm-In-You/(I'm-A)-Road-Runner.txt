Ooh yeah

Not to easy
Just to live a life free and easy
With my toothbrush in my hand
Won't you let me be your traveling man
Cause I'm a roadrunner, baby ooh ooh

I'm a roadrunner, baby
Can't stay in one play too long
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Look at me and I'll be gone

Well you can love me if you wanna
I can do nothing
When I get restless
I got to move somewhere

Yes I'm a roadrunner, baby
Gotta go some place on my own
And I run as I live
Gonna live like I run
Roadrunner, baby

I don't need no woman to tie me down
You know I gotta be free, baby to roam around
Ya know all my life I've been like this
Love me at your own risk
When the dust hits my shoes
I just gotta move

I'm a roadrunner, baby
I just got to keep on, keeping on (ooh ooh)
I'm a roadrunner, baby
I can't stay in one place too long

I'm a roadrunner, baby
Anywhere, anywhere on my own
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Got to keep on, keepin', keeping on
Ooh ooh
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Anywhere, anywhere on my own
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Anywhere on my own
