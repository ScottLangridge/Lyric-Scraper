I don't care where I go when I'm with you
When I cry you don't laugh cause you know me

I'm in you - You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had

You and I don't pretend; we make love
I can't feel anymore than I'm singing

I'm in you - You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had

Come so far where you think of last fall
You can't buy what we made, you and I

I'm in you - You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had
