As Performed By Peter Frampton

Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just won't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

I'm gonna have fun in the city oh
I'll be with my girl she's so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is out of sight just to me
Tonight I'll spend my bread
Tonight I'll lose my head
Tonight I just got to get tonight oh tonight
Well Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day grind once more
Know of nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich man, rich man
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Well tomorrow I'll be there
Cause I've got Friday on my mind

Gonna have fun in the city oh
I'll be with my girl she's so pretty oh oh
She looks fine tonight
She is out of sight to me
Tonight I'll spend my bread
Tonight I'll lose my head
Tonight I've got to get her tonight oh
Monday I have Friday on my mind

I'm gonna have fun in the city
I'll be with my girl she's so pretty
But I'll have fun in the city
Be with my girl she's so pretty
Ow ow in the city
Hey tonight
