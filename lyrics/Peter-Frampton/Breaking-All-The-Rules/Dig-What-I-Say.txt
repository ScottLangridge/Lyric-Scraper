Put on some make-up baby dress up to kill
Dig what I'm saying cause it gives me a thrill
That's what I want to see, you know it's all for me

Well you have a way about you, drives me insane
Well where are your stockings baby I don't want you tame
That's all I want to do, you know it's all for you

Come with me now, walk in the wild
Watching your face, the face of a child
Don't be afraid to let yourself go
Do what you want no one will know

You drive me crazy with your golden beret
Dig what I'm saying, I'm sure it's okay
I'm getting used to you but you're always new
