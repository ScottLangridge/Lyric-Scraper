When I told you it was fine to come
I was in for one big surprise
Now I lay awake and count endless hours
Tears are dropping from my eyes
Here's a message for everyone
You must never let her go to far

Yesterday you called my name
Now you're gone and I'm insane
Seems I've made the same mistake again

It's true, I was livin' on a razor's edge
You were leavin' for L. A.
Now you know me, I'll go to sleep out there
It's quite alright but I'm going to L. A.

Yesterday you called my name
Now you're gone and I'm insane
Seems I've made the same mistake again

Keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive

When I told you it was fine to come
I was in for one surprise
Now I lay awake and count these endless hours
Tears are dropping from my eyes
Here's a message I made for everyone
You must never let her go to far

Cause yesterday you called my name
Now you're gone and I'm insane
I think I made the same mistake again

Keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive
We gotta keep, keep it alive
Yeah keep it alive, keep it alive
Keep it alive, keep it alive, keep it alive
