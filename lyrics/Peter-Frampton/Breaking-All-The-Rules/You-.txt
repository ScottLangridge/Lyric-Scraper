Hey baby, give me a break
I seem so frantic
It might be too late
I'm trying, trying to hard
Trying to see what's behind the facade

Turn around, you never hear what I say oh oh
Hey baby, how do I get thru
I'm trying every angle with you
Don't tell me, you call me unfair
All your lying is like a knife in the back
Don't deny, you never hear what I say
Whooh oh oh

You kill me with your lies
You kill me, don't you cry
You kill me whaaooh oh
You kill me oooh oh oh
You kill me

Yeah
Hey baby give me a chance
Won't you take me for one last dance
Hey baby I'll do you right
I'll take you dancing way into the night
Don't deny, you never hear what I say
You never hear, never look, never see
What I say

You kill me with your lies
You kill me, don't deny
You kill me ooh oh oh
You kill me oow oow
Ooh ooh

Yeah you kill me with your lies
You kill me, don't you cry
You kill me whaaooh
You kill me ooh ohh
You kill me
