A man, appears to be strong
Can start out with nothing
And take on the world
Girl, you take it all away
Leave him with nothing, nothing
Nothing to say

Rise up above
And let your heart see again
Rise up above
And light your mind

Heart, is going your own way
You've got to believe in yourself
If you want to be strong
Nooo, no one is perfect
You must be giving
If you want to be seen

Chorus

Those times when you're calling out, you're alone
You're just a minute away
You're just a minute away
Got to set yourself free
Oh please, get yourself free
Ooh ooh ooh
