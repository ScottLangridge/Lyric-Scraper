Since the day arrived
Heard them talking, telling lies
Heard them telling their friends
Once sweet love has reached it's end

But baby, I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Baby, no no no

Called you up at eight
Tell me you ain't feeling great
How do I explain
Standing here out in the rain

But baby, I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Baby, no no no

When I love with you
All the things we plan to do
Now they tell me you've gone
Well it won't be for very long, baby

I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Baby, no no no
(Repeat 2 more times)
