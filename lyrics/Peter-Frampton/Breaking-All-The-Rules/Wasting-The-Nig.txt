Can you see it in the river
Can you find it in my eyes
When the devil takes me over
It will come as no surprise

Said it's no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
This is no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away

Give me time in this confusion
When I seem to lose control
Now I break thru this illusion
Let it be, let it go

And there's no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
This is no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
Yeah yeah yeah

Yes there's no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away

Give me time in this confusion
When I seem to lose control
Now I break thru this illusion
Let it be, let it go

Cause there's no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
This is no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
This is no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
Yes there's no time to fight
As we're wasting the night away
