I wonder how your feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea
Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I call?
The stars are out and shinning but all I really want to know, "Oh, won't you show me the way, everyday?"
I want you, show me the way, yeah

Well, I can see no reason, you living on your nerves when someone drops a cup and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part
Well someone thought of healing but all I really want to know, "Oh, won't you show me the way, everyday?"
I want you, show me the way
I want you, day after day

I wonder if I'm dreaming?
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me
I watch you when you're sleeping and then I wanna take your love
Oh, won't you show me the way, everyday?
I want you, show me the way (One more time)
I want you, day after day
Hey, I want you, day after day, hey

I want you, show me the way, everyday
I want you, show me the way, night and day
I want you, day after day, hey, ooh
