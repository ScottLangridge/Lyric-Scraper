Only one step away
Before I touch the bay
Do I still have to pay
Sand between my toes
And nobody knows how I'm feeling
Just not healing
We'll do it again one more time

I'm not turning you away
I'm needing some advice
If you think I'm running out
It's you I want to live with
Till I can't go any further
Lovin' you
We'll do it again one more time

Only one step away
Before I show the world
All the hurt you have inside
Only lasts awhile
'Cause nobody knows how I'm feeling
Just not healing
We'll do it again one more time
Till I can't go any further
Lovin' you
We'll do it again one more time
Nobody knows how I'm feeling
Just not healing
We'll do it again one more time
