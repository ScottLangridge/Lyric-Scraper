I'll give you money
I'll give you lovin'
I'll give you everything
But heaven above

I'll give you all I have right now

I'll give you money
I'll give you lovin'
Everything

I'll give you kisses
Sweet as honey
I'll do you everything
'Cept make the sun shine

If I could change the world right now

Make you happy
Stop your cryin'
Everything
Everything

All of my life I've been dreaming
'Till you came my way
All of your life aren't you searchin'
For love forever

All I need is someone to believe in me
Even if you're losing
Watching from behind everything

(instrumental)

I'll give you sun and...
Lost all my money
I threw it all away
But now I'm happy

I'll give you all my love right now

I'll give you money
I'll give you lovin'
Everything
Everything

Money- everything
Everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything...
