I'm yawning, I been up too long
Day's dawning, blackbirds sing your song
So peaceful, hid away in the trees
Stone palace left catching the leaves

Well, who goes there in my dream
Stealing the fish from my stream
I keep taking the blame
For a crime that's basically the same

I'll take you journey back in time
Keep on dreaming, don't lose my mind
My rainbow touches down on you
I'm running but it's gone from my view

I don't mind what they say
You and I will find a way
I don't care the cupboard's bare
Right now

When the rooster calls
Time to go
I'll be there fighting
You can take my word

Well, who goes there in my dream
Stealing the fish from my stream
I keep taking the blame
For a crime that's basically the same

Well, the day's fading and I'm missing you
I'm reaching open arms, so true
Keep on moving, you don't feel the pain
I'm learning that love is no game

Shut up
