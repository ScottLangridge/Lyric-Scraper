Sun and fresh air starts a fanfare
Playing in my heart
Melody come back to me and stay awhile
I can see you, I'm not near you
Talking in my sleep
I'll be happy if you stay awhile

Well I got no home, have to roam around
Loving you is worth more than this pound
Like to shout, maybe hit the wall
Lovin' used to make me feel so small

Please pull me through I'd do the same for you
Never let you down
You're the reason that I carry on
When I worry then you hurry
Just to make me smile
I'll be happy if you stay awhile

Well I'm movin out got no doubt you'll see
Lovin' me won't give you time to breathe
Like to shout, maybe hit the wall
Lovin' used to make me feel so small

When I worry then you hurry
Just to make me smile
I'll be happy if stay awhile
Sun and fresh air starts a fanfare
Playing in my heart
Melody come back to me and stay
Ooh melody come
