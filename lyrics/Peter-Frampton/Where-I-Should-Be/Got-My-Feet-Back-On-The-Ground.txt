Days are getting brighter
Nights are creeping in
My heart's feeling warmer
It's starting to begin again
Love's around the corner
Time feels like, what do I do

Always in my music
Never lacked a cause
My head is spinning
Lady, what I lost
Like walking thru a blizzard
Find my way out
It's like an illusion to me

Looking for a landing
Trying to get out
I was wired to the world
That you dream about
Think I'm thru with looking
But got my feet back, back on the ground

People started looking at me
Every place I go
Then you realize
Is it me, that they see
The story is always over
The tale's just begun

I'm making every lover
I made it way to young
Friends say, don't worry
What do they know
I just know they care

People stop and look at me
Every place I go
Hey when you realize
Is it me, that they see
Hey it's been so long
Since I really cared
Now I got this feeling
Feeling that's so rare
Cause loves around the corner
Got my feet back, back on the ground

(Repeat First Verse)

What do I do
