I'm drivin', drivin' my car
And I look up at the billboard
There you are

I'm flyin', flyin' away
And I look into a magazine
Oooh, what's your name

You don't reply
She don't reply
But please reply

I'm fallin', fallin' in love again
I got no solution, don't know your name
I'm hoping that we can meet someday
How can I find you, will you answer my call today

Then don't reply
She don't reply
Please reply

Right now you're just a fantasy
Should I keep it that way
If I met you tomorrow
Would I still feel the same way

Let me put it another way
We could be in love
Maybe we should be a fantasy
Maybe we've got close enough

Everyday I look around
Hey baby, you're nowhere to be found

Hey don't reply
Just wink an eye
She don't reply
Please reply
She don't reply
