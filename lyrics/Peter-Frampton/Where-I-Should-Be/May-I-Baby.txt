May I baby
May I walk you home
May I baby
Cause I don't want you to be all alone
With each step my heart beats three times
There's so much trouble in my mind

May I baby
Tell you what it's all about
May I baby
I hope your, your anxious to find out
I'm just a little boy, live behind the grocery store
You know I've been watching you come and go now

May I baby
Call and tell you how I feel
I'd love to find you home, yes I do
I think you and nobody else, yeah
Your black father didn't listen to what I was saying
He said, She's been doing the same thing for so long

May I baby 
May I feel like before to you
May I baby
Can I call and tell you how I feel

Put your hand in my hand
Put your hand in my hand
Show you understand
Put your hand in my hand
Show you understand
Put your hand in my hand

Put your hand in my hand
Show you understand
Put your hand in my hand, yeah
Show you understand
Put your hand in my hand
