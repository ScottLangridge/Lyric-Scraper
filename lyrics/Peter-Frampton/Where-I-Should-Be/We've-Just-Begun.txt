Please give me strenth
We've just begun
If you held a secret
Please let me be the one to know
Going away well I recall
Remember when you would leave me here

Send me a postcard
Signed, sent from the sun
I think I can hear you
You were my only one

(We've just begun)

Why don't we learn
That we must treasure
When you choose a lover
She must be aware
Photographs you take, show loving eyes
Smiling faces that can hide the truth
You don't care if they seem to stare
What you got, you ain't about to share

Help me, don't hurt me
I'm hanging on to a dream
If you lose this lover
You're going to have to be so strong
Don't run away, hey I recall
Remember when you would leave me here

Send me a postcard
Signed, sent from the sun
I think I can hear you
You were my only one

We've just begun
(Repeat 6 more times)
