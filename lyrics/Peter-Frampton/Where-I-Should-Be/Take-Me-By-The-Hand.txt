Side by side on an empty porch
Late at night, watch the moonlight fly
Glass of wine, ooh that'll do just fine
Only one thing left to do and then she said

Take me by the hand
And love me through
Take me like I am
Take me by the hand
And love me through
Wake me by the sand
You take me to, take me baby
Take me by the hand
And love me too

Touches my heart, when I hear this song
Takes me back to your world
Now I'm here, on a beach with you
Only one thing on my mind and then she said

Take me by the hand
And love me through
Take me like I am
Take me by the hand
And love me through, baby
Wake me by the sand
You take me to, take me, take me like I am
Take me by the hand
And love me too

Shooting star, I don't know where you are
New place in time
I came back, I was born again
I can see you, talk to me
And then she said

Take me by the hand
And love me through
Take me like I am
Take me by the hand
And love me through
Wake me by the sand
You take me to, take me, take me
Take me by the hand
And love me too

She said, take me by the hand
And love me through
Take me like I am
Take me by the hand
And love me through, love me through
Wake me by the sand
You take me to, take, take, take me
Take me by the hand
And love me too
