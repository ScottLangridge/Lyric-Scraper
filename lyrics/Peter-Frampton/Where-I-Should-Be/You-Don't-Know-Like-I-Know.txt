You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning she's my water
In the evening she's my cup of tea
And I love, yes I did
If ever troubles rise
I go to her and like a miracle
Everything's goin' be alright

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
She brings her lovin' home now
Just the way it's suppose to be
What she wants, baby she can get
Tender lovin' til she's ready
Til she's ready, til she's ready to quit yeahaah

And I love, yes I did
When ever troubles rise
I go to her and like a miracle
Everything's goin' be alright

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning she's my water
In the evening she's my cup of tea
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows like I know
You don't know baby I don't know
You don't know, nobody knows
You don't know, I don't know, she don't know

You don't know like I know
You don't know like I know
You don't know like I know
You don't know like I know
You don't know like I know
