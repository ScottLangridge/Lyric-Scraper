Everyday I would get up
Start looking for you
Those morning blues
Would carry me thru the day
It ain't nothing new

I know you held the aces
Cause I dealt you the hand
So you'd never surrender
To the leader of this band
Need you more and more
Love more the one I adore

You got everything I need
You got everything I need
You got everything I need
You got everything I need

I heard it said
What a man gets
Is what a man deserves
Life gets thick
Tempers quick
Shatters my acoustical nerves

City to city, town to town
Running me ragged
Running right and wrong
Making music mades me weak
Then it makes me feel so strong
Give it all, for the time has come
Get up and have my fun
