I Thought It Was Forever
Then You Took My Love For Granted
I Tried So Hard To Please You
Everyway I Could

Everytime I Think Of You
But All I Have To Say Is
But To Me It's A Sad Affair
To Me It's A Sad, Sad Affair

Knowing You As I Do
I Think You Will Survive
It Can Take A Year Or More
But Just Let's Be Alive

Everyday And Now I Think Of You
But All I've Got To Say
To Me It's A Sad, Sad Affair
To Me It's A Sad, Sad Affair

When You Know It's Over
And Love Goes Out The Door
Peaking Up Those Pieces
Will Hurt So Much More

You Know I Can Wish
And You Can Hope
All I Have, All I Have To Say
But To Me It's A Sad, Sad Affair
Yes To Me It's A Sad Affair
Yes To Me It's A Sad Affair

You Can Wish
And I Can Hope
There's Nothing That We Can Do
Cause To Me And To You
It's A Sad Affair
To Me It's A Sad Affair
Yes To Me It's A Sad Affair, Sad Affair
