Lines on my head from that one thing she said
She spoke of strangers that don't sleep two a bed
Kept on trying, buying time, not waiting on fate
I somehow got the feeling that I opened my eyes too late
I saw where you came from
Called out your name
But there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
I made you my wife but I don't need that
Lines on my face, while I laugh lest I cry
Speed city dirt and gritty waving me goodbye
So many people, my family of friends
Trying so hard to make me smile untill this heartache mends
I saw where you came from
Called out your name
But there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
I made you my wife but I don't need that
Ice in her eyes, frozen tears would never be a surprise
You can't erase a dream you can only wake me up
My mind is turning slower, never to accept defeat
It don't matter where I live I still got a house to heat
I saw where you came from
Called out your name
But there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
I made you my wife but I don't need that
