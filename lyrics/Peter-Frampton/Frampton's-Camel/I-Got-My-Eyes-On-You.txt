Step this way, for a better day
It's quiet insane
Knowin' that I came
In from the cold, one track mind
I can't leave behind I don't feel tierd ''cause I'm really wild

I'm keeping my eyes on you you, baby
Sticking to me, like glue
I got my eyes on you, yeaa
While you do what you have to do

Sudden moon can't you play my tune
I walked right in to another room - they let me in
I belive I got you up my sleave - nothings wrong
Your're just another weave

I'm keeping my eyes on you you, baby
Sticking to me, like glue
''cause I got my eyes on you, yeaa
Do what you have to do

You must only understand the part of me you see
We can start again baby I can let you be
Don't want you leavin' before we have a chance
I don't wannna set you free, yea yeaaa

(guitar solo)

Well i'll catch a plane
Or better take a train
Don't give up when ya brake the cup
Let you be above the sea witout a phone
Got to live I'm on my own

Keeping my eyes on you you, baby
Sticking to me, like glue yeaaa yeaa
I got my eyes on you, baby
While you do what you have to do
