Suddenly with no warning
It was four in the morning
What the papers will say has been printed
I have no reason
To want to change the season
It's just the time of year
Ooh yeah, it's just the time of year

Suddenly I'm yawning
Maybe cause it's five in the morning
Sleepless nights I have wasted

You are the reason
Don't talk to me of treason
It's just the time of year
Oh yeah, it's just the time of year

Only one
Could steal your heart away
But now she's looking the other way
What you give
I find it hard
I can't see
If you knew you wouldn't take it from me
Writing notes to an unconquered land
Lying there on your square foot of sand

Wake me up
I'm sleeping
Good to see how your keeping
Me
I'm doing fine
I'm just wasted

I have no reason
To want to change the season
It's just the time of year
Ohh yeah, it's just the time of year
Just the time of year
Oh oh oh, just the time of year
Just the time of year, that's what it is
And it's just the time of year
