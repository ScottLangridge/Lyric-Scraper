Which Way The Wind Blows

Something roaming around my head
But I don't know who I'm gonna write to
You know I looked inside my book of dreams
But I don't know which one I'm gonna sleep to yet
Oh no I don't know which one I'm gonna sleep to

Found me, you loved me, then you turned me on
But I don't know why, maybe you do
You know I love my house and yet I cannot stay
Because I can't see which way the wind blows
'Cause I can't see which way the wind blows

Do what you want, cause the summer is here
Do what you want, think I'm making that clear?
Do what you want, don't have a care, I think that's fair
Ooh ooh...

Ah, ah, ah

Words don't come so easy now
'Cause there's a hole where my heart used to be
Now she's gone, I have got to choose
But I don't know now, what's the use?
And I don't know now, what's the use?
'Cause I can't see which way the wind blows.
