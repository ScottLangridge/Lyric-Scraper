Mine she's blind she's all I need to be at ease
Love light burnt so bright lady you're a fantasy
I play on her emotions
There's no point I don't get no reaction
'Cause she'll leave as she came
And I gave her my name
Serpentine sunshine with you, baby with you

Floating mind you're a kind of candle shadow on the wall
Pisces child running wild weeping willow cries alone
I don't want to replace her
She don't look, she don't look when I face her
Though I treasure the thought
Which could never be bought
Side by side rowing with you, rowing with you

I need your love more than I need you
So please, don't fade away keep you in my view
I can't see - I can't be

I don't want to replace her
She don't look, she don't look when I face her
Though I treasure the thought
Which could never be bought
Side by side rowing with you, rowing with you

Don't fade away, please don't fade away
