Woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine, what wine, where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been
Come on - lets do it again
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
My friend got busted just the other day
They said don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
He drove into a taxi bent the boot hit the back
Had to play some music otherwise he'd crack
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?

~~guitar solo~~

Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
Champagne for breakfast and a sherman in my hand
***** Top, ***** tails - never fails
Must have been a dream I don't believe where I've been
Come on - lets do it again
Do you, you feel like I do?
Do you, you feel like I do?
