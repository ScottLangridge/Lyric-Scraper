When the lights come on
And the fever is high
Moments of madness
And mixed emotions
When we reach the dawn
We've got a lot to say
We can start again
While we scream
For one more day

It's like moving a mountain
Let's get it done, roll the stone
Like a man who is crazy
I'm gone

Why do we beg for more
No one could witness spite
I must look pretty sick
Cause we can't seem to quit, no no
We often turn away
It's only self-defense
But where can we go
When there's no hiding place

Chorus

When the lights go down
And the fever is gone
We must do each other
The fever is high once more

Chorus

It's like moving a mountain
It ain't the writing on the wall
Like a man who is crazy
I'm gone

Move a mountain

Move a mountain

Move a mountain
