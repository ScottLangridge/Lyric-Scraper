Fascination is right there in you eyes
This conversation is a very thin disguise
'Cause I know that deep inside you
There's a war cry from the hear
Don't shatter my elusions
And leave me in the dark
When you need a love reaction
Let your instincts lead the way

'Cause we all hear the call of the wild
But we run scared into the night
But when we hear the call of the wild
Don't be afraid to change your mind - yeah, yeah

Your hesitation is easy to understand
When this situation could get really out of hand
And it only stands to reason
That you should feel this way
When love is so elusive
And so hard to disobey
But when we need some interaction
Ooh, it just gets in the way
'Cause we all hear the call of the wild
But we run scared into the night
But when we hear the call of the wild
Don't be afraid to change your mind - yeah, yeah
[Solo] And I know that deep inside you
There's a war cry from the heart
'Cause we all hear the call of the wild
But we run scared into the night
But when we hear the call of the wild
Don't be afraid to change your mind - yeah, yeah
