I been waiting mutch too long
In my heart you know I feel so strong
We can rectify all this wasted time
I need you to be my lover and my friend
So this story will not end

Stop
Don't turn me down
Stop
I'll never let you down

We've seen heartache and we've seen rain
You and I made it through again
I will stand by you
No matter what you do
I will always be your lover and your friend
So this story will not end

Stop
Don't turn me down
Stop
I wanna lay you down
Stop
Please don't turn me down
Stop
I'll never let you down

We can rectify all this wasted time
I want you to be my lover and my friend
So this story will not end

Stop, stop
Don't turn me down
Stop
I wanna lay you down
Stop
Please don't turn me down
Stop
I'll never let you down
Stop

Solo

Stop
Stop
