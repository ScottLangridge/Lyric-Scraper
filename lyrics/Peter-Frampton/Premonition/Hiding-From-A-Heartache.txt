In the eyes of the world, I don't deserve ya
But they don't know that there's thunder in the air
Mutual attraction was never enough
But now I know you can do without me
I don't know if I'm over you

Late at night
I'm hiding from a heartache
Yes I'm
I'm hiding from you
I'm so tired
Of living with a heartbreaker
So I, I'm hiding from you

In the words of a fool, I can't remember
But in our guarded moments I might break
It seems our love was just a hit and run
But while it lasted, you were second to no one
I don't know if I'm over you

Chorus

When I'm faced with the memory of love
And it's you that I want but you're not enough
Take it all easy, you can't believe what you see
Cause my heart isn't mine to control
And it seems to be out of control
Full of desire, it's making a liar of me
Oh no

Chorus

(I'm tired, tired of hiding)
Yes I'm, I'm hiding from a heartache
Yes I'm, I'm hiding from you
I'm so tired of living with a heartbreaker
So I, I'm hiding from you, you
