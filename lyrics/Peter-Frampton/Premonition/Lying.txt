I'll tell you something about an hour ago
I see you with someone I don't even know
I caught you lying -- Yeah, you were lying
Ooh lying
I get the feeling from the look on your face
When it comes down, you're a disgrace
You should be trying -- You're always lying
I caught you lying
All day and all of the night
I've been wondering why
All of the times you stayed away
Everyone knew but I
Take your reasons through that door
Don't come calling anymore
I can fight you I can't win
I don't know what game you're playin'
You don't even notice -- You don't even care
I see you with someone -- I don't think that's fair
When I'm walking through streets at night
Don't know their names
I come back to find you playing one of your games
Lying, yeah you were lying
I caught you lying
But baby - All day, all of the night
I've been wondering why
All of the things you said you were
I know the reason why
So, take your reasons through that door
Don't come calling anymore
I can't fight you I can't win
I don't know what game your playin'

Lying, lying
But baby - All day, all of the night
I've been wondering why
All of the things you told to me
I know they were a lie
Take your reasons through that door
Don't come calling anymore
I can't fight you I can't win
I don't know what game you're playin'
