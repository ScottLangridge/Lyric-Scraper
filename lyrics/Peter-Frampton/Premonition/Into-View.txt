I can take you to the Eiffel Tower
I could call you every single hour
When I stayed behind in my chevrolet
I can hear, no matter what you say

So all these things come into view
Stop me saying, "I love you"

But there's always another hill to climb
Never enough of that precious time
Ready enough that you see my way
Oh, won't you give me just a one more day

And all these things come into view
Stop me saying, "I love you"

I got this feeling, won't go away
I got so much I can't hide
I'm feeling stranger, stranger than you
I have to sing it now

All these things come into view
Stop me saying, "I love you"
Hey talk about it

All these things come into view
Stop me saying, "I love you"

I got this feeling, won't go away
I got so much I can't hide
I'm feeling stranger, stranger than you
You were right there by my side

There's always another hill to climb
Never enough of that precious time
Ready enough that you see my way
Oh, won't you give me just a one more day

And all these things come into view
Stop me saying, "I love you"
All these things come into view
Stop me saying, "I love you"
