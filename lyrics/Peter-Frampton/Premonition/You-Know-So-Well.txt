I got no money
I've got no time
I got to hurry
Before they cut the line
Speak to me baby
You don't have mutch to say
I killed somebody
Just the other day

I was wrong
Two wrongs can't make a right
I was wrong
I won't be seeing you tonight

I got no secrets
As you can tell
I made a mess of things
You know so well
You took my money
And my self respect
I had to do it
I had to collect

I was wrong
Two wrongs can't make a right, baby
Yeah, I was wrong
I won't be seeing you tonight

They have me locked up
Here in my cell
I have a fever, baby
You know so well
I woke up screaming
Sweat all over me
As they were tying me
To the nearest tree

I was wrong
Ooh, two wrongs can't make a right
Yes, I was wrong
I won't be seeing you tonight
I was wrong
Two wrongs don't make a right
I was wrong
Ooh baby, I won't be seeing you tonight
