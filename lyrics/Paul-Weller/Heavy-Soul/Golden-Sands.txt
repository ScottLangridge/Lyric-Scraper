Try - try if you can
Try and get your back up
And off the golden sands
Try to get somewhere
That you've never been
As you sit upon the green grass
There's still so much to see
And find yourself - waiting just to fly
Fly - fly

Just what you want
Is just what you'll get
As you fall upon the real path
Or take the safer bet

You can give everything
Still none comes to you
You can hang life 'round you're neck, y'all
I may hang there too
And find myself - waiting just to fly
Fly - fly

Try - try if only for you
You can hang life 'round your neck y'all
Or you can be there too
And find yourself just waiting to fly
Fly - fly
