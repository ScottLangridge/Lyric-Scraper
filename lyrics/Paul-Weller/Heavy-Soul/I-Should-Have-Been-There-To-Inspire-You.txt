Nothing I'd say or I could do
Could move the mountains from your view
Nothing I see or I could show
There's only darkness now I know
I should have been there to inspire you
Not paint your world a cold, cold blue
I should have been there to inspire you
I could have told you truthful too
?? ? - that I believed in you

I could have been there within your reach
This is not self pity of which I speak
I never took time to see how you'd grown
I never took the care it takes to know
Never took the time to see what you'd found
But always had the time to bring you down

More than all this I do not know
Only that love is here to show
Someone a world, to be themselves
A place to fall when all else fails
And friends harsh words cut deep and sore
But believe me mine will hurt me more
In those moments before I sleep
When I am truly alone to see

I should have been there to inspire you
Not paint your world a cold, cold blue
I should have been there to inspire you
I could have told you truthful too
?? ? - that I believed in you
