Yellow strands mingle into red
Warm air blows, down upon her soft bed
She licks my face and the feeling spreads
I'm up in suzes' room - flowers bloom-ing-ful
I'm up in suzes' room - where life goes so soon
She's anything that you can call free
She's everything that she wants to be
She has everything that you could want to see
I'm up in suzes' room - flowers full in bloom
I'm up in suzes' room - where time goes so soon
Soon, against the moon
A big sky paints - but she calls the tunes
She's cool that way - how I wish it could stay
Forever that way

No one moves - no one can
When luck rolls its' coins, they land where they stand
To make us everything that you never planned
I'm up in suzes' room - people bloom-ing-ful
Up in suzes' room - where life goes so soon
