She's in my head,
She's in my mind.
And I'm all she says,
Yes she knows me well,
As well as you can.

She's on my side,
I often hide,
In her magic hair.
And there I learn again,
The joy of life.

The wonder of it all,
And this I feel,
That through her I learn,
Another way to be.

Sha la la la la,
Sha la la la la.
Sha la la la la,
Sha la la la la.

Take my breath,
I feel consumed.
Take me up,
I want to know,
What lies behind,
Your smiles and shells.
Wish I knew them well.

Come in my head,
Come in my mind.
You can own it all,
When you open up,
To be yourself.

Sha la la la la,
Sha la la la la.
Sha la la la la,
Sha la la la la.
