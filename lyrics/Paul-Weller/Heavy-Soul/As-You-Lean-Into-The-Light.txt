Gentle rain
Here it comes again
Rattling 'round your window, threatening pain
Coming on like a friend, but you know better than
Yesterday that held you by a different hand
Hail and stone
And all that's gone
When everything that passes, cuts to the bone
Turning like a wheel dragging a heavy stone
A weight that ties you down that you will never own

Strange to see, a paper smile on thee
When once you moved and light the room
For us all to be
Now if I could be the sun I'd shine in your life
If I could be the rain, I'd rain from your eyes
And I'd wash away the emptiness you feel inside
