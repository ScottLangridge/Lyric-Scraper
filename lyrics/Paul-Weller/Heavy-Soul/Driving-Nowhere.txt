Driving nowhere - going no place
I'm just drifting - I've got low faith
I'm just waiting for a tide
To take me nowhere - along for a ride
Pleasure sifting - can you keep it
And as I'm drifting - it's hard to feel it
I feel I'm floating in a time
Driving nowhere - along for a ride

I've nowhere to be - only leave some miles behind
And within me I see, there's places I've yet to find

Driving nowhere - going no place
I get restless - I'm still curious
And I'm just waiting for a tide
To take me nowhere - along for a ride
I'm driving nowhere
