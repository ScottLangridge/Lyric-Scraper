Minds alive! On friday street
Summerflys around my feet
And wee still stars
Are in my eyes
And mine's alive on friday street
A pulse goes on, on friday street
Time seems longer against it's beat
And it's easy to remember
And it's hard to forget
That mine's alive on friday street
Yeh! Mine's still alive on friday street

And I see myself
And it seems so clear
I can walk through the world
Like I'm not really here
And I really don't care
'cause mine's still alive on friday street
Lives alive on friday street
You start to shine in a brand new heat

And the world is clear
Like you're not really here
And I see myself
And I'm really not scared
'cause mine's still alive on friday street
Mine's still alive on friday street
It's like plugging back in on friday street
May it always come alive! On friday street
