I have my thoughts to position
But do I know how to act?
I have no silent ambitions
But does that make me a man
Until I learn all I can
And mean all I understand
As a way of giving
I'm a piece of the earth
I take no offence
I can be who I am
I have no pretence
Only to what you can be
If you want to be
It's a way of living

I've got a pen in my pocket does that make me a writer
Standing on the mountain doesn't make me no higher
Putting on gloves don't make you a fighter
And all the study in the world
Doesn't make it science

So grab a piece in the air
Try an' make it sing
Try and be who you can
It's the real, real thing
I'm into what you can be
If you want to be
As a way of living

I've got a pick in my pocket does that make me a player
Words can't do - what action does louder
Putting on gloves doesn't make me a fighter
And all the study in the world doesn't make it science
