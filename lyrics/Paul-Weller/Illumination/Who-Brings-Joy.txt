You who brings joy
Into the world
Makes me swirl
Of such love
And all you ask
In return
Is to be loved
And love you i must
Compelled by god
Or some invisible force

I just want so much
To be here for you
You my darling who
Brings so much joy

Every laugh has an echo
Every movement a feat
I humble in your complexion
So perfect so complete
You who brings joy
Into the world

In your eyes lie a heaven
In your voice sweet caress
It is you who takes over
Whose gentle arms i rest
You who brings joy
Into the world
Makes me swirl of such love
