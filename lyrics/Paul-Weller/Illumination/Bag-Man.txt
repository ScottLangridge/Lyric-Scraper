Bag man
(Paul Weller)

You may find me in the street somewhere
I may be floatin' round the bins
I'm looking for something
Something's looking for me
I don't know what it is

True connection to the open sky
That always calls to me
Like I'm waiting for something
That I've seen somewhere
I don't know where that was

Daylight time for bag man
To carry home his heavy load of nothing

Daylight time for bag man
To carry home his heavy load of nothing

Try to catch me in the morning air
Try to see me as I swim
I'd sooner be looking
Than to know everything
In every part of me

Daylight time for bag man
To carry home his heavy load of nothing
To carry home his heavy load of nothing.
