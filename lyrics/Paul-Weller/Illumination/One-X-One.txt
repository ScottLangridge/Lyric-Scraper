Share your dreams
Give us all the beam we need
Like electric light
In a ballroom scene
Going one x one

Shed your chains
To earth like dew and all remain
Forever in another vein
As you slip into another dream

Don't fear not
Not where you tread
Fear only- the lies you're fed

Head that sign
For all of us who wait in line
Waiting for the words to rhyme
Bringing on a brand new day

Don't fear not
Not where you tread
Fear only- the lies you're fed

So dance little dancer
Like you've never danced before
It's just a moment
We're going through
This is the new dance that we do
So sing little brother
And turn on everyone
Lift are spirits high
To a place we need to find

Share your dreams
Give us all the beam we need
Like electric light
In a ballroom scene
Going one x one

Shed your chains
To earth like dew and all remain
Forever in another vein
Going on one x one
