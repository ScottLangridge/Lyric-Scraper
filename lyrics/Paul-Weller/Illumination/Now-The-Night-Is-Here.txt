Let's you and I
Blow gently on
The embers of today
Now the night is here
To tell us - to be in love

Let us not talk
Harshly now
Our time is to reconcile
Now the night is here
To tell us - to be in love

Now the night softly says
That the world is here to stay
Falling out misty dreams
We arrive so swift it seems to be

No velvet dress can compare
To your beauty face so fair
And your grace shall carry you through
To a better place
And I shall follow you

Let's cast the wind
That brought us here
'til we know not when
Now the night is here
To tell us - to be in love
To be in love
