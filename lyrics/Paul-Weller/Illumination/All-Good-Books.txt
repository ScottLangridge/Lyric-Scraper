If Jesus could hear us now
Bending all his words
Of which he's proud
But the carpenter was only
Making invitations
Voicing the opinions of others

Sending down a word
That travels well
Only as a vessel
As a bell
And the violence you've mistaken
In the words you took to be taken
And the images of hatred
Against all that we're worth
All that you love
All that you give
All we hold dear

If Mohammed could see us now
Shaking down the walls
But not as prayer
And the power games that play out
And the lies that come within out
Against all we are worth
All we hold dear
All that is true
All that we love
All we dream of
All that you give
