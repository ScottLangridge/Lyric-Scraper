Come to my side child
Don't leave me alone
Stay with me darling
I can't face this on my own.
I need you to be with me
I need you in life
I want to forever
Be yours and you'll be mine
Oh child
Cos' we're going places
Never thought we could
Through all kinds of changes
But still our hearts beat closer more and more.
More than just a heart beat
From the city floor
More than just the bright lights
That lend me to your distant shore.
I'm keeping my head up
And out of the sand
Way 'cross the rooftops
I'm gonna plan our escape
Oh child
We're going places
Never dreamt we could
Through all kinds of changes
But still our hearts beat closer more and more (x2)
