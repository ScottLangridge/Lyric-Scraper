Standing out in the universe
On every life in store
Hope is where you lift your head
Written in the dawn

Sending out like an sos
And most of us agree
Now's the time to change your mind
Now's the time to change your mind for free

Standing out in the universe
For every new star born
God speed the light you make
And shine on us all

Sending out to the universe
That hope is on it's way
Now's the time to open eyes
And realise that we've all parts to play

Now the world's at a place
People torn and disgraced
There's no time - there's no time - like today
- to feel the wings of change

Now the worlds at a stage
Born of war raised in rage
So little time - little time
Like today
To feel the wings of change -

Standing out in the universe
For every new star born
God speed the light you make
And shine on us all

Sending out like an sos
Let everyone agree
Now's the time to change your mind
Now's the time to change your mind for free

Standing out in the universe
Standing out in the universe
Standing out in the universe
