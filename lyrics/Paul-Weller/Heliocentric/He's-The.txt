He's the keeper
Of the lantern
Stone believer-
It's a passion,
And he knows it
He's the keeper
Hanging wishes
-up upon our stars
As he waits for love
Yes he waits for love.
Flying without a hand
Trying to brave the land
Something about the man
-is about to make a stand!
With nothing but liars and thieves
Trying to purchase thee,
Where are you meant to go
-but fly away - high away.
He's the one knight
On a knackered stallion
His rusty armour-
So undervalued,
Does he know that
He's a reason,
He's asleep now
But never gone,
As he waits for love,
Yes he waits for love-
Hanging without a cloud
Hopeing to draw a crowd
If he's willing to take a chance-
-come on people make a stance!
From tiny acorns grow-
All kinds of seekers,
And where are they meant go-
But fly away - high away
In the maelstran of indecision
Shine! Believer!
Find the season
He helped to grow it-
-he's the keeper
Hanging wishes-
-up upon our stars
As he waits for love
Yes we wait for love

He's the keeper
Of the lantern
He's the message
In the midnight-
Of your madness,
In the backlog of conversations
We never had-
We wait for love
Yes we wait for love.
