As worlds end with new ones to open
As you change your aim
And lives thrown up into the open
Get on a different plane

Words meant but were left unspoken
Take on a different name
And hearts mend that once were so broken
As time heals the pain

'til you can find it in your heart
To forgive if not to forget such a part
Of life that you lost

As worlds end with new ones to open
As you change your aim
And lives thrown up into the open
Get on a different plane

Words meant but were left unspoken
Take on a different name
And hearts mend that once were so broken
As time heals the pain

Never stopping like rain dropping
To find a place on earth

You'll find you'll wake up fresh instead
You'll find me less inside your head
With words left unsaid

As you lose your mind, something else in time
And faces strange - rearrange
