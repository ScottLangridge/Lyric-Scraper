Well shes waiting, by the window-
Worth a fading tear
That will slip in to tomorrow-
And have no fear-

She may look back and blame you
-but you only blame yourself,
And what good would it all do you
If you thought she blamed herself-

Its a lonely life, as bits of dust and rocks
When you shake it off - it is all you have
In the time it takes, to find another space
Get to live again - shell run and run
Still shes waiting, by the window - with a fading tear.

Well she looks upon, high - flying silver dream-
How she wishes how
She could climb aboard, never coming back
-turn on it all
Still shes waiting, by the window-
She has no fear.
