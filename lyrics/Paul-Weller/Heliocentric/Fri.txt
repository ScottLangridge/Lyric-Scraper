1.
I shakes and fall
Underneath my sheets
The sunlight creeping
From my head down to my feet
Telling me to rise
And face the light again

2.
I plead to dawn
"don't make me move"
I just want to vanish
And forget all that's true
Just one more night
And I'll be alright

Br.
Hoping to be everything you want
Wish I was the man that you thought I was
Waiting to fly up on eagles wings
But truth be told - I'm not that bold - at all

Ch.
I'm more frightened
White lightening
So sudden and blinding
Yet no more enlightened
Just a little more frightened

3.
I'm gonna get it back
I'm gonna get it soon
I've just got to catch up
For my world to resume
To be light
And to hold you tight while you dream

4.
And I stand alone
So does everyone
It brings us closer together
As a strange distant sum
So nar so far

Br.
Hoping to be everything you want
Wish I was the man that you thought I was
Waiting to fly up on eagles wings
But truth be told - I'm not that bold - at all

Ch.
I'm just frightened
Woke up this morning like that
And all the roads that lead back
Lead me nothing that is nowhere
-lonely

Ch.
-and just a little more frightened
White lightening
So sudden and blinding
Yet no more enlightened
Just a little more frightened
