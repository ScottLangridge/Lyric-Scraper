I saw you today, or at least I think it was
It's hard to say, we've all changed so much
Compelled to look, but I hid my face
It's hard to trace - these feelings
Gone so soon, the time I spent with you
And like an old, old tune-keeps running through my head
I wanted to say, so many things
But my mouth went dry - and one word and I'd cry
Slender bride, your beauty shines from you
And forever more, I'll be on your side for sure
A light in your life, that always burns for you
As time passes... So quickly
The final stage, we've both reached some way
As we board our trains to different stations
And the parts we play, and the things we say,
Words on the way - to discovery
