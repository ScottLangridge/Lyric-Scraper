The sun came out & hung above
Over our heads but far enough to see
A bomb exploding in another town
Children choking on a poison cloud
While on the streets, where lovers once walked,
Side by side in idle talk
Bullets fall like unholy rain
People change as the panic sets in -
A frightened baby by her dead mother's side
In a brutal world where there's nowhere
To run, hide or cry -

Now nothing feels the same way -
Feels like it's changing again -
Upon a street with no name
It's hard to find it again -

I ran as fast as my feet could fly
Down country lanes where I took my time-
Time like a hound snapping at my heels
I got past thinking so I could feel -
Feels like a film playing in my head
And I kept rolling down green surrey hills -
In spring-

Now nothing feels the same way
Feels like I'm changing again
Upon a street with no name
It's hard to find me again -
The sun came out & hung above, over our heads
But far enough to see
