Some people think they're jammy
But I know they must be crazy
Can't see their misfortune
Even if they're lazy
Walk throughout the fire
Drive throughout the smoke
See my enemy at the end of the rope

Walk on piles of needles
See what they can do
Walk on gilded splinters
With the king of the zulus

Kon kon, the kiddy kon kon
Walk on gilded splinters
Kon kon, the kiddy kon kon
Walk on gilded splinters

Here I go, now
Til I murder, til I'm dead

I rode out my coffee
By drinking poison from my chalice
Propped against my faith
I drink oil for my malice

Meet me on your doorstep
Soon we'll be in the gutter
Melt you just like butter
I'll make you stutter

Walk throughout the fire
Drive throughout the smoke
See my enemy at the end of the rope

Walk on piles of needles
See what they can do
Walk on gilded splinters
With the king of the zulus

Kon kon, the kiddy kon kon
Walk on gilded splinters
Kon kon, the kiddy kon kon
Walk on gilded splinters

Til I murder, til I'm dead
