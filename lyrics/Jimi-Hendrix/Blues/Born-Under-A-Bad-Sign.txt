Born Under A Bad Sign,
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
Wouldn't have no luck at all

Bad luck and trouble
Been my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten

Born Under a Bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for real bad luck
If it wasn't for real Bad luck
I wouldn't  have no luck at all
