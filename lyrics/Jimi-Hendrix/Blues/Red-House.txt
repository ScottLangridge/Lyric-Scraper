There's a red house over yonder, that's where my baby stays.
There's a red house over yonder, baby, that's where my baby stays.
Well, I ain't been home to see my baby in about ninety nine and one half days,
'bout time I see her.

Wait a minute, something's wrong.
The key wont unlock the door.
Wait a minute, something's wrong, baby.
The key wont unlock the door.
I got a bad, bad feeling that my baby don't live here no more.

I might as well go on back down,
Go back 'cross yonder over the hill.
I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill, (That's where I come from)
Cause if my baby don't love me no more.
I know her sister will!
