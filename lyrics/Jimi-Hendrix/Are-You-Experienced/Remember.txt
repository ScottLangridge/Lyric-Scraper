Oh, remember the mocking bird, my baby bun
He used to sing for his supper, baby
Yes he used to sing for his dinner, babe
He used to sing so sweet
But a since my baby left me he ain't sang a tune all day
Oh, remember the blue-birds and the honey bees,
They used to sing for the sunshine
Yes they used to sing for the honey, baby
They used to sing so sweet
But a since my baby left me they ain't sang a tune all day
Hey pretty baby, come on back to me
Make every body as happy as can be
So baby, if you'll please come home again
You know I'll kiss you for my supper, yeah
You know I'll kiss you for my dinner, baby now
But uh, if you don't come back you know I'll have to starve to death
'Cus I ain't had one kiss all day now, ah babe
Please remember
You've got to remember
You've got to remember our love
Come on back, baby, come on back in my arms,
I'll make everything that better
Come on, baby, hurry up now
Can you hear me calling you back again now?
Come on, baby, stop jiving around, hurry home, hurry home
