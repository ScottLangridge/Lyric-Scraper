The beginning vocals were slowed down but with the words in front of you, you can understand them!!!

'star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. Over'
'i am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun. Over'
'you mean it's the earth? Over. '
Positive. It is know to have some form of intelligent species. Over'
'i think we should take a look. '

Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silken seas
Your mysterious mountains
I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine

Although your world wonders me
With you majestic superior crackling hen
Your people I do not understand
So to you I wish to put and end
And you'll never hear surf music again
