Astro Man, Here I come To save the Day

Anyway I was Waking Up 'n had a dream Just the other day, some Mind turned my mind out of my head and Flew it away, Somebody Pinned a Badge on top of my Chest, Said Get out there Boy and Do your Best

*Strange Noises*

I heard they Called me Said the Astroman
Heard I'm Flying Higher Than
That Old Faggot Super man
Ever could

Called me Astro Man, I'll Give you a hand
I said i'll go out, Blow out the Rest The Rest of your mind

"strange noises"

*Guitar solo*

*Solo Over*

Astro Man, You no he's Crazier than, That Ole' Faggot Super man
An he'll try if he can
To blow out the Rest of your Mind, Blow Up the Rest of your mind

Astro Man'll leave you a piece of, He'll be takin Out your Behind
Talkin 'bout pieces

*Strange Noises*

Fly Untill you die!
