Dolly Dagger
Jimi Hendrix "First Rays of the New Rising Sun"

Here comes Dolly Dagger
Her love's so heavy, gonna make you stagger.
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge... Ah Drink up baby

Been riding broomsticks since she was fifteen.
Blown out all the other witches on the scene.
She got a bull whip, just as long as your life.
Her tongue can even scratch the soul out of the devil's wife.
Well I seen her in action at the Player's Choice.
Turnin' all the love men into donor boys.
Hey, red hot mama you'd better step aside,
This chicks gonna turn you to a block of ice.
Look out

Here comes Dolly Dagger,
Her loves so strong gonna make you stagger baby.
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge.
Ride over,
Drink up, baby
Hey!

Yeah, look at old burnt out superman
Tryin' shoot his dust off the sun.
Captain comet is dead on the run
The words of love
Do they ever touch Dolly Brown?
Better get some highway and clear out of town.

Here comes Dolly Dagger,
Her loves so heavy it's gonna make you stagger.
Dolly Dagger, she ain't satisfied until she gets what she's after.
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge.
Better watch out baby, here comes your master,..
Drink up, drink right on up baby
Watch out devon and give me a little bit of that heaven

Dolly everybody get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly everybody get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly everybody get it on, get it on, get it on
Dolly everybody get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on get it on, get it on, get it on
Ooo, ooo, ooo, yeah, yeah, yeah
