Jimi:
"yeah, thank you very much.  I'd like to do this song dedicated
To maybe A soldier in the army.  Singin' about his old lady that
He dreams about and humpin' A machine gun instead or it could be
Could be A cat maybe tryin' to fall in love with that girl baby,
But A little bit too scared. That's where the problems come from
Sometimes isn't it?  I meen the cat is really insecure A little bit
So the call girls groupies and they call girls this.  And they call
Passive people hippies and bla bla, woof, woof, all down the line
That's because their not in love man that's what's happening.  That's
The other half of A man, is woman.  And we'd like to play A thing called
Izabella, and don't you ever forget it. "

Izabella
Girl, I dream about you every night
Every night
Hey, girl you know we got A war
Got A war to fight
So I think about you every day
Oh, and I hope you listen to me right

Hey, izabella
Girl, I'm fighting this war for the you
Hey little girl I fight this war for the children and the world and you
So I hope you hear me baby, yeah
Cause what I try to tell you is true
Hey

Izabella
I fight this war for the children and you
Hey girl, I said I fight this war for the children and you
Please save your love for me
Then I'll know the fightin' is true
Izabella
Hey
Izabella
I'm gonna fight this war against nature, my heart

Jimi:
"thank you very much. And I'd like to go on with another slow thing.
I'd like to get by with A little bit of jam messin' around with back
At the house.  I think we're going to call "get my heart back together
Again"
