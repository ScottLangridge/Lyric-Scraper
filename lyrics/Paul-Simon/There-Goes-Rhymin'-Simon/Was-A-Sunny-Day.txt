Words & music by paul simon

Was a sunny day
Not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard
From the people passing by
'twas a sunny day
All the birdies in the trees
And the radio's singing song
All the favorite melodies

He was a navy man
Stationed in newport news
She was a highschool queen
With nothing left to lose
She was a highschool queen
With nothing left to lose

Was a sunny day
Not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard
From the people passing by
'twas a sunny day
All the birdies in the trees
And the radio's singing song
All the favorite melodies

Her name was lorelei
She was his only girl
She called him "speedoo"
But his chistian name was mister earl
She called him "speedoo"
But his chistian name was mister earl

Was a sunny day
Not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard
From the people passing by
'twas a sunny day
All the birdies in the trees
And the radio's singing song
All the favorite melodies
