Snowman sittin' in the sun doesn't have time to waste. He had a little bit too much fun, now his head's erased. Back in the house, family of three, two doin' the laundry and one in the nursery.
We brought a brand new baby back from Bangladesh, thought we'd name her Emily. She's beautiful. Beautiful.
Yes sir, head's erased, brain's a bowl of jelly. Hasn't hurt his sense of taste, judging from his belly. But back in the house, family of four now: two doin' the laundry and two on the kitchen floor.
We brought a brand new baby back from mainland China, sailed across the China Sea. She's beautiful. Beautiful.
Go-kart sittin' in the shade: you don't need a ticket to ride, it's summertime, summertime, slip down a water slide. Little kid dancin' in the grass, legs like rubber band. It's summertime, summertime. There's a line at the candy stand. Keep an eye on them children, eye on the children in the pool. You better keep an eye on them children, eye on them children in the pool.
We brought a brand new baby back from Kosovo. That was nearly seven years ago. He cried all night. Could not sleep. His eyes were bright, dark and deep.
Beautiful.
