I was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown
Rearranging my position on this friend of mine who had a little bit of a breakdown
I said, "Hey, no breakdown is called a breakdown if it goes, so
What are you going to do about it that's what I'd like to know? "
You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could

It was in the early morning hours when I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers, I slammed into a brick wall
I said, "Hey, is this my problem?
Is this my fault?
If that's the way it's going to be, I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt"
You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could (You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could)
You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could (You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could)

I was walking down the street when I thought I heard this voice say
"Say, ain't we walking down the same street together on the very same day?"
I said, "Hey Senorita that's astute"
I said, "Why don't we get together and call ourselves an institute?"
You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could (You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could)
You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could (You don't feel you could love me but I feel you could)
