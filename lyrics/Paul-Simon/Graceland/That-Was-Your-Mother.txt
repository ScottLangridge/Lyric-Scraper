A long time ago, yeah
Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great
I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state
Well, I'm standing on the corner of lafayette
State of louisiana
Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those cajun girls
Dancing to zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck
If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

Well, I'm standing on the corner of lafayette
State of louisiana
Wondering where a city boy could go
To get her in a conversation
Drink a little red wine
Dance to the music of clifton chenier
The king of the bayou

Well, that was your mother
And that was your father
Before you was born dude
When life was great
You are the burden of my generation
I sure do love you
But let's get that straight

Well, I'm standing on the corner of lafayette
Arcoss the street from the public
Heading down to the lone star cafe
Maybe get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Standing in the shadow of clifton chenier
Dancing the night away
