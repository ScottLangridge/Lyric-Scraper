The first time I heard "peggy sue"
I was 12 years old
Russians up in rocket ships
And the war was cold
Now many wars have come and gone
Genocide still goes on
Buddy holly still goes on
But his catalog was sold

First time I smoked
Guess what - paranoid
First time I heard "satisfaction"
I was young and unemployed
Down the decades every year
Summer leaves and my birthday's here
And all my friends stand up and cheer
And say man you're old
Getting old
Old
Getting old

We celebrate the birth of jesus on christmas day
And buddah found nirvana along the lotus way
About 1, 500 years ago the messenger mohammed spoke
And his wisdome like a river flowed
Through hills of gold
Wisdome is old
The koran is old
The bible's
Greatest story ever told

Disagreements?
Work 'em out

The human race walked the eart for 2. 7 million
And we estimate the universe at 13-14 billion
When all these numbers tumble into your imagination
Consider that the lord was there beefore creation
God is old
We're not old
God is old
He made the mold

Take your cloths off
Adam and eve
