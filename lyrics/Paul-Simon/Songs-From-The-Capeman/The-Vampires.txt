Hernandez
Well, did you bring me my money,
My cab fare
My new shoes?
I got expenses, you know
Where's my weekly dues?

Sal
I ain't giving you my fucking money.

Hernandez
Oye, mother fucker, where's this jibaro from?
You go when I say.

I call, you come.
You know it takes a strong man to survive.
It ain't no accident that you're still alive.

Hernandez & the vampires
We stand for the neighborhood

Hernandez
He still lives with his mami, but he sneaks down,
A coolie in the shadow of the playground
You want to fight for your people, don't you, sal?

Sal
Well, yeah, if I got to.

Hernandez
Oh, you got to. Come here, I want to show you something.

This is the cave of the vampires,
Count dracula's castle,
The very sight could turn a white man grey.
Made in the shade, use my umbrella
Black like the night we fly in.
That blade is all you need to keep the dogs away.

So, you want to be a vampire, man! That's good.
We always looking for young blood in the neighborhood now
Carlos apache collects the dues
So you bring us something that we can use

Hernandez & the vampires
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano,
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano,

Hernandez
Frenchy cordero goes down to hell's kitchen
To sell the irish some weed
So this paddy boy's mother on the stoop starts bitchin'
'bout spics is a mongrel breed
Now here comes her son
He looks like a ton of corned beef
Floating in beer

He says
'fucking puerto rican dope-dealing punk
Get your shit-brown ass out of here. '

Hernandez & the vampires
'fucking puerto rican dope-dealing punk
Get your shit-brown ass out of here. '

We stand for the neighborhood.

Hernandez
So the shanty-town irish they kicked his ass good.
Fractured his collar bone
Coo, all I was thinking is, 'what home of the brave?
This a fucking war zone'

The vampires
If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano,

We stand for the neighborhood.

If you got cojones, come on, mette mano

We stand for the neighborhood

If you got the balls, then come on, mette mano,

We stand for the neighborhood.

If you got cojones, come on, mette mano
