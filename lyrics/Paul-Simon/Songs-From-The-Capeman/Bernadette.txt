Whoa------i got time on my hands tonight
You're the girl of my dreams
When I'm near you my future seems bright

Oo------i want you to be my girl
I want you to be my movie
I am sal mineo and I need you so
Sweet bernadette

Whoa------you got style from your hair to your heels
Though my words may be jumbled
Still I'm telling you just how it feels

I love you

Sal & bernadette
I love you
And the breeze that wraps around you

Sal
Satin summer nights

Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home
Dom dom dom doo

Sal
Wop, wop, wop, wop
Come with me
There's a place I want you to see

When the leaves are dark
I've got a hiding place in central park
And the sky is a coat of diamonds

There's a wooden cross over my bed
The city is lit with candles
They're shining for you bernadette.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oo oo, bernadette

Sal & bernadette
Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home
Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home

Sal
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop.
