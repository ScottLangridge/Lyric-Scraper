Teen idol
The way you move
It's got quality
Come on baby, let's go downtown
Little girl, you sure look good to me
The way you move
It's got quality
Come on baby now don't be shy
Step in the light so I can see
The way you move
It's got quality

Girls
I want to know
Are you my beautiful young boy
Or just another love
Passing through my life
I need to know
Will you be my sorrow and my joy
And maybe one day soon
Will I be your wife.

Come on baby,
Let's rock some more
I want to spend my salary
The way you move

Everytime they see me walk down the street
They say co? O that boy is fine
The way he moves

Girls
I want to know
Are you my beautiful young boy,
Or just another love
Passing through my life,

I need to know
Will you be my sorrow and my joy
And maybe one day soon
Will I be your wife
Quiero saber
Quiero saber
Nadie nunca sabe
En la vida
