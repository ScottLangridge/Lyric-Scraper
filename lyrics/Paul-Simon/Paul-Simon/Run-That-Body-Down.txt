Words & music by paul simon

Went to my doctor yesterday
A-a-a-a-ah, she said I seem to be O. K.
A-a-a-a-ah, she said
"paul, you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think that you can
Do what you been do-o-in'
Who, now who you foolin? "
I came back home and I went to bed
Ah, I was resting my head
My wife came in and she said
"what's wrong, sweet boy, what's wrong? "
Ah, I told her what's wrong
I said "peg, you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think that you can
Do what you been do-o-in'
Who-o, now, who you foolin? "
Kid, you better look around

How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think that you can
Do what you been do-o-in'
Who-o, now, who you foolin? "
Who-o, now, who you foolin? "
