Half and hour you change your strings and tune up
Sizing the room up
Checking the bar
Local girls unspoken conversations
Misinformation
Plays the guitar

They say jonah was swallowed by a whale
But I say there's no truth to that tale
I know jonah
Was swallowed by a song

No one lets their dreams be taken lightly
They hold them tightly
Warm against cold
One more year of traveling 'round this ciruit
Then you can work it into gold

Here's to all the boys who came along
Carrying soft guitars in cardboard cases
All night long
Do you wonder where those boys have gone?
Do you wonder where those boys have gone?
