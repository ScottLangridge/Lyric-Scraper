Give me all
Give me all
Give me all your attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless
Ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else

I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine
Oh mine

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you should never live so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I woulda say that to you if it wasn't true

I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine

Treasure, that means what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
