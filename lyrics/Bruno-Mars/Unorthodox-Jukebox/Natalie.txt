Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Wrong turn on a dusty road
I did it too much so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind
Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her door
Cause once I get my hands on her, imma ooohh

Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone well I'm diggin a ditch for this gold diggin bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for pretty little thing named
Natalie, if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

The good lord better bless your soul
Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please please please
And Im'ma look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
I'll spend a lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there aint no use in tryin
Once I get my hands on you, imma oooh

Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone well digging a ditch for this gold diggin' bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for pretty little thing named
Natalie, if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run

I shoulda known better
Cause when we were together
She never said forever
I'm a fool that paid her game

Hey

Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone well I'm digging a ditch for this gold diggin' bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for pretty little thing named
Natalie, if you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run
