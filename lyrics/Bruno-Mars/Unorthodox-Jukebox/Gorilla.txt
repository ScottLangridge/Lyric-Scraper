Ooh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine kicker and Im feeling like Im thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what youre doing, look what youve done
But in this jungle you cant run
Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, youll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas

Yeah I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like youre scared
Youre just smiling tell me daddy its yours
Cause you know how I like it yous a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff, call the swat we dont stop, we keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And youre screaming give it to me baby
Give it to me m-therf-cker

Ohhh look what youre doing, look what youre done
But in this jungle you cant run
Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, youll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla

You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
Youll never be the same baby once Im done with you

Oh you with me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby well be f-ckin it like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas
