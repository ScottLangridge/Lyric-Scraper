Easy come, Easy go
That's just how you live oh
Take, take, take it all
But ya never give

Should'a known
You was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, 
Why were they open? 
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash, 
You tossed it in the trash you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah )
I'd jump in front of a train for ya(yeah, yeah, yeah )
You know I'd do anything for ya(yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh, 
I would go through all this pain, 
Take a bullet straight through my brain, 
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" 
When you get back to where you're from

Mad woman, bad woman, 
That's just what you are, yeah, 
You'll smile in my face then
Rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love
Is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain, 
Take a bullet straight through my brain, 
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire, ooh
You'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did baby... 

But darlin' I'll still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain, 
Take a bullet straight through my brain, 
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same.

No, you won't do the same, 
You wouldn't do the same, 
Ooh, you'll never do the same, 
No, no, no, no
