Ahh yes

Well looky here looky here
Ah what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheeps clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby baby please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay

To every girl that I meet here this is what I say:
Run run run away, run away baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get get away get away darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run run away run away baby

Well let me think let me think
Ah what should I do?
So many eager young bunny's
That I'd like to pursue
Now even now they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby baby please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay
To every girl that I meet here this is what I say:

Run run run away, run away baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get get away get away darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run run away run away baby

See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No no, no I just wanna work you baby
Yup yup
See I ain't try to hurt you baby
No no, no I just wanna work you baby
If you scared you better run (You better run)
You better run (You better run)
You better run (You better run)
You better you better you better

Run run run away, run away baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get get get away get away darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run run run away run away baby!
