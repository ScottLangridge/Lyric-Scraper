{Verse 1}
Girl here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way

{Chorus}
Is that alright? Is that okay?
There's no need to be nervous, no babe
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing babe
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's my first time with you

{Verse 2}
Baby, and I wanna make it right for you, (it's our first time)
Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious
Like ice cream on a summer day, gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah

{Chorus}
Is that alright? Is that okay?
There's no need to be nervous, no baby
'Cause I got you all night (all night baby), don't you worry girl
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
Then I'll go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
Then I'll go real slow with it, slow with it
It's my first time with you

{Verse 3}
We can go slow (we can go slow), we can go fast (we can go fast)
All you gotta do is ask me girl, ask me girl
The candles are burnin', our bodies are yearnin'
I can't wait tonight, I'm so ready babe
I'm so ready baby

{Chorus}
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's my first time with you

Baby, and I wanna make it right for you
It's our first time
