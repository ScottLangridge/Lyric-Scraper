Today, I don't feel like doing anythin'
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear I'm not doin' anything

I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobodys gon' tell me I can't
No

I'll be lounging on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
Cus in my castle I'm the freakin man

Oh Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it cus I can

Today, I don't feel like doing anythin'
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear I'm not doin' anything

Nothin' at all
Woohoo ooh
Woohoo ooh hooh ooh ooh
Nothin' at all

Woohoo ooh
Woohoo ooh hooh ooh ooh

Tomorrow, I'll wake up do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out "this is great"
[OhmyGod, this is great]
Yeaaah

I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man would be so proud of me
But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

Oh Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it cus I can

Today, I don't feel like doing anythin'
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear I'm not doin' anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
Cus I ain't going anywhere
No No No No No No-No-No No 

I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah-Yeah-Yeah Yeah... 

Ohh ohh
Today, I don't feel like doing anythin'
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cus today I swear I'm not doin' anything

Nothing at all
Woohoo ooh
Woohoo ooh hooh ooh ooh
Nothing at all

Woohoo ooh
Woohoo ooh hooh ooh ooh
Nothing at all
