[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Little supernovas in my head,
Little soft pauses in my dead,
Little souvenirs and secrets shared,
Little off guard and unprepared,
I was never good enough to find,
I was never bad enough to mind,
In the middle I will do my best,
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you anything to...

[Chorus:]
Say you wanna stay,
You want me to,
Say you'll never die,
You'll always haunt me,
I wanna know,
I belong to you,
Say you'll haunt me
(Together, together, we'll be together, together forever)

[Verse 2:]
Little variations on my page,
Little doors open on my cage,
Little time has come and gone so far,
Little by lil' look who you are,
I can see the patterns on your face,
I can see the miracles I traced
Symmetry and shadows I can't hide,
I just wanna be right by your side

[Pre-chorus 2]
I will give you everything to...

[Chorus 2:]
Say you wanna stay,
You want me to,
Say you'll never die,
You'll always haunt me,
I wanna know,
I belong to you,
Say you'll haunt me

Say you wanna stay,
You want me to,
Say you'll never die,
You'll always haunt me,
I wanna know,
I belong to you,
Say you'll haunt me

[Together, together, we'll be together, together forever]
I belong to you!
[Together, we'll be together, together forever]
I belong to you!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Little supernovas in my head,
Little soft pauses in my dead,
Little souvenirs and secrets shared,
Little off guard and unprepared

[Pre-chorus 2]
I will give you anything to
I will give you everything to

[Chorus 2]
Say you wanna stay,
You want me to
Say you'll never die,
You'll always haunt me
I wanna know,
I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

Say you wanna stay,
You want me to,
Say you'll never die,
You'll always haunt me,
I wanna know,
I belong to you,
Say you'll haunt me

[Outro]
[Together, together, we'll be together, together forever]
I belong to you!
[Together, we'll be together, together forever]
I belong to you!
