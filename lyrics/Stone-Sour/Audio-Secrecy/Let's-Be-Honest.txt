Oh disaster - I know I'm long overdue
There's no answer - I know I shouldn't have listened to you
Before I let you decide, you have to know that I lied
I only do what I do

Let's be honest - I watched you walk away, yeah
You went off to find - anything else - anything less
On your own...

Oh the Karma - I know it's coming for me
Oh no harm done - except as far as the eyes can see
The only issue for me, as cavalier as it seems
Is how you handle extremes - you never bother
Before I let you destroy - the very world I enjoy
You gotta do what you do

Let's be honest - I watched you walk away, yeah
You went off to find - anything else - anything less
I guess...
Im only honest - I'm only here to say, yeah

You've been gone so long - everything else - is already less
On your own...

I'm a Slave - I will Beg
All I want is something better - something that is safe
You can say - you will stay
But I know fucking better - you will never change

Let's be honest - I watched you walk away, yeah
You went off to find - anything else - anything less
I guess...
Im only honest - I'm only here to say, yeah
You've been gone so long - everything else - is already less
I guess...
Let's be honest - I watched you walk away
You've been gone so long - everything else - is already less
On your own...
