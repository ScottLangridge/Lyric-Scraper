Just this once
I'll go the front I'll let you all disagree
You won't last all you got is the past
An overnight shotgun that fucked you the dream
No excuse and no surprise
The real Mccoy is the look in your eyes
I don't rate let them alienate
This American selfish everything!

We're the breakdown I will break ground
An original sin
Suddenly I'm on the right side
In the middle of nowhere again

I am in your hands and I don't mind
'Cause I don't understand
I am in your hands
I want you all to tell me who I am
Just tell me who I am
Just tell me who I

Just in case it's an arrogant fate
'Cause I know you all wanna see
Here's the test you are tied to the past
No one fells like you screams like me
All the confusion and all the control
The real Mccoy isn't real anymore
And I'm amazed at the innocent taste
Of America's selfish everything!

We're the breakdown I will break ground
An original sin
Suddenly I'm on the wrong side
In the middle of nowhere again
I am in your hands and I don't mind
'Cause I don't understand
I am with your hands I want you all
To tell me who I am
Just tell me who I am
Just tell me who I am
Somebody tell me

I am in your hands and I don't mind
I don't understand
I am in your hands but I don't mind I don't mind
I am in your hands but I don't mind
'Cause I don't understand
I am in your hands
I want you all to tell me who I am
Just tell me who I am
Just tell me who I am
Just tell me who I am
Tell me who I am
