You were my fire
So I burned till there was nothing left to me
I... I touched your face
I held you close
Till I could barely breathe

Why? Give me hope
Then give me up
Just to be the death of me
Save the rest of me

'cause I see you
But I can't feel you, anymore
So go away
I need you
But I can't need you, anymore
You hesitate

Now, now and then you come around
Like there's something left for me
You were one, oh, you were everything
I'm still here, but I'll just keep the rest of me

'cause I see you
But I can't feel you, anymore
So go away
I need you, 
But I can't need you, anymore
You hesitate

Oh, we never made it...
You hesitated...
Oh, I don't believe
That I see you

But I can't feel you, anymore
So go away
I need you, 
But I can't need you, anymore
You hesitate
'cause I see you
But I can't feel you, anymore
So go away
I need you, 
But I can't need you, anymore
You hesitate
Hesitate

You were my fire...
So I burned, till there's nothing left to me
