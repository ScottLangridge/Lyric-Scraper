Hold your breath and say goodbye - you never say a word
When you feel like your heart's gone wrong
When you feel like you've stayed too long... It's over

Letting go, has let you down
Just let me show you why
Every life is a chance to try
We can live like we both can't die

Oh in all this time
I never wanted to destroy a dream come true
And all this time
I never wanted to destroy someone like you
I want you to stay
So give me a sign
Give me your hand
I'll take you home

In the dark we're all the same
We only seem alone
There's a place that we all must hide, 
There's a place that we lock from the inside... When it's over
Everything we ever were
And everything we are
We will heal as the days roll by
'cause in the end... It's you and I

Oh in all this time, 
I never wanted to destroy a dream come true
And all this time, 
I never wanted to destroy someone like you
I want you to stay
So give me a sign
Give me your hand
I'll take you home... 

We are sewn inside the fabric that is holding us together
We can only pray that something so tragic will save us all
Will save us all, we are on our own again
We are on our own again

Oh in all this time, 
I never wanted to destroy a dream come true
And all this time, 
I never wanted to destroy someone like you
In all this time, 
I never wanted to destroy a dream come true
And all this time, 
I never wanted to destroy someone like you

I want you to stay
So give me a sign
Give me your hand
I'll take you home

We are on our own again! 
We are on our own again! 
We are on our own again! 
We are on our own again!
