I've seen it all and I know better
I've felt the bitterness and pain
My soul keeps changing like the weather
The only constant is the rain
I know your black and white intentions
And there's no room for shades of grey
I've never asked you to conform to me
I only beg for you to stay

Waiting here tonight for you to come
But your love just disappeared
Waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here

I still have dreams that we're together
And I can still taste your skin
Reminders all around surrounded by your light
I don't wanna die again
I don't deserve to be discovered
I don't deserve to know you care
I only want my promised other
Not someone who isn't there

Waiting here tonight for you to come
But your love just disappeared
Waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here

Ooh, waiting here all night for you to come
But your love just disappeared
Waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here

Waiting here all night for you to come
But your love just disappeared
Waiting in the dark for miracles
But miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
Miracles don't happen here
