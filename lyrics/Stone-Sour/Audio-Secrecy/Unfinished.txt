While my hands are tied behind my back
You save the best and put me to last
I've given up on giving you my heart
I fuckin' hate it - I waited
Think about all the times we faked it
And realize that we tore this place apart

But there's no reply from you
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
We aren't finished

With my fingers crossed behind my back
I let your words slip through my cracks
This person you perceived is dead and gone
I fuckin' hate it - you're jaded
We can scream for the hell we created
This time I won't let you get me wrong

'cause there's no reply from you
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
There's just no reply from you
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you

Oh, you wanna hurt me
Before I go you wanna break me down
But you'll never hear me
You'll never feel the way I feel
We aren't finished here

Cause there's no reply from you
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
There's just no reply from you
No matter what I do
I'll never get away from you
We're not finished here
