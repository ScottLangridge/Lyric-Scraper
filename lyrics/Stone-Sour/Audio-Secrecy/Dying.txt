It's only common sense so please don't take offense
I gotta say what's on my mind
'cause all this bitterness has made me second-guess
And I've waited all my life
You know it's true - it isn't me, it isn't you
I can't be your man
But here's what I don't understand

If I can't live without you
But I can't breathe when I'm with you
What are we really doing here?
I don't wanna live without you
But God only knows what I've been through
'cause dying is all we're doing here

You leave me suffering till I can't feel a thing
It's all I got when I want more
If I waste one more day then they can take me away
'cause it'll be worse than it was before
You know it's true - it isn't me, it isn't you
I can't be your man
But here's what I don't understand

If I can't live without you
But I can't breathe when I'm with you
What are we really doing here?
I don't wanna live without you
But God only knows what I've been through
'cause dying is all we're doing here

If I can't live without you
But I can't breathe when I'm with you
What are we really doing here?
I don't wanna live without you
But God only knows what I've been through
'cause dying is all we're doing here
Oh, if I can't breathe when I'm with you
What are we really doing...
What are we really doing here?
I don't wanna live without you -
I don't wanna live without you
'cause dying is all we're doing here
