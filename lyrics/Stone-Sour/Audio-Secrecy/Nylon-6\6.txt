Oh, you stay locked in your head while you're raising the dead
And all your neophytes are hanging on everything you said
You said you can take it from me since you took it from me
Even now, the shadow I cast won't set you free

Do you feel your essence through the pain?
If you lose your conscience...

Take away the last of your woes that you're setting in stone
Well, your cover is passive-aggressive and blown
This is not about you, because it's all about you
You're out of luck... Cause this is me not giving a fuck

Do you feel your essence through the pain?
If you lose your conscience...

Just save yourself to sacrifice
A little truth for the cause, for the blame
Will you concentrate to realize your fate
Because  we want more  we want more

Be what you want to be, get away you're free
What you want to be, get away you're free
What you want to be, get away you're free

Just save yourself to sacrifice
A little truth for the cause, for the blame
Will you concentrate to realize your fate because
Oh, just save yourself to sacrifice
A little truth for the cause, for the blame
Will you concentrate to realize your fate
Because  we want more  we want more
