Careful, the heathen wants to play... 
Do you wanna be saved?
Someone doesn't feel himself today... 
What a way to behave

When does your karma start to disarm your explosive demeanor?
It's not a reason to seethe
I see you showing your teeth
These are the valleys of greed

I can't believe my eyes
There's a fire across my skies
There's only so much left
But what does it matter
Everything is shut off

Careful, the medicine's designed to stain
So we can see your veins
Rose Americana pennies will rain
In the face of the sane

Better depression builds hungry legends
I always imagined the end was here in our sights
I never said it was right
This is the battle we fight

Oh, I can't believe my eyes
There's a fire across my skies
There's only so much left
But what does it matter
Everything is shut off

Oh, I can't believe my eyes
There's a fire across my skies
There's only so much left
But what does it matter
Everything is shut off
