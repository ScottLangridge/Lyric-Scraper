Every now and then a lifetime needs a second chance-
To find another one like you
Don't forget your better reason-
All your silly risks will bring you down
Oh several years of bitter Mondays take a heavy toll-
And then you realize, it's you
Until you make this easy harder-
No one else will care if you're around

If you live your love with no to most
Every day is just about the sorrow
You should know what they want to get
If it's you, they won't let you forget

Oh so much for gentle lions-
Gathering the sheep
All I wanted was-
Something safe
Show me your ungrateful tyrants
I'll point out the mirror-
Point to you
Oh this is where forever gets us-
Immoral wishes and oblivion
I can't stay
I don't need the conflagration
I don't need the hate
And I don't need you

If you live your love with no to most
Every day is just about the sorrow
And you should know what they want to get
If it's you, they won't let you forget

So if you live a life with no tomorow
Every day is just about the sorrow
You should know what they want to get
And if it's you, they won't let you forget

Oh I'm on my own
I'm on my own
