Until the pages of this book are filled with emptiness
Im still suspended by a thread, expecting nothing less
I feel my kindred little ways... I know how my story ends

Like me... its not your gift to choose- I know youre going to lose
Like me... this futile circumstance- you never had a chance
Like me...

Im here, walking in a city that is red again
Im here, living with the dead again
Knowing why Im here again

Like me... its not your gift to choose- I know youre going to lose
Like me... this futile circumstance- you never had a chance
Like me... like me... like me... like me

I canT stay here forever
The hell is, I just canT remember
I see myself in desperation
The cyanide of realization
I fall...
I fall...

Like me... its not your gift to choose- I know youre going to lose
Like me... this futile circumstance- you never had a chance
Like me...
