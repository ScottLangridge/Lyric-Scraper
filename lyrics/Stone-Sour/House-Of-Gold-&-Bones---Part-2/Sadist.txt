Withering eyes catch you as you fall
A bitter sigh...
No one knows at all
Let me in...
For one more long disgrace
Just forget...
The same distractions you refuse to face

We both know that it's gone
But what if no one knows...
No one knows to remember why it's wrong?
This is all the pain a man can take
This is how a broken heart still breaks

I don't need much to show you
Only enough to control you
Bury your head inside this
And gather the darkness that binds it

I think I'll die if you deny me
Swallowed alive in eternity
Give me a way to be the agony
That knew you all along

Push it down and hide me from this waste
Don't hold back...
I'd kill to take your place
Tell me a lie...
Tell me you don't care
Just forget...
A storm is coming
Just forget your skin

We both know this ends
But what if no one knows...
No one knows how to kill us in the end?
This is all you need for who you are
This is how a good man goes too far...

I don't need much to show you
Only enough to control you
Bury your head inside this
And gather the darkness that binds it

I think I'll die if you deny me
Swallowed alive in eternity
Give me a way to be the agony
That knew you all along

This is all the pain a man can take!
This is how the blackest circle breaks

I don't need much to show you
Only enough to control you
Bury your head inside this
And gather the darkness that binds it

I think I'll die if you deny me
Swallowed alive in eternity
Give me a way to be the agony
That knew you all along

I knew you all along!
I knew you all along!
