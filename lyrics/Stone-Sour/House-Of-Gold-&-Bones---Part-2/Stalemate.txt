If I fail, if I fall... 
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same... 

Where do I go, and what do I do?
I'll never know if I never get through
The more I fight, I stay... THE SAME! 

Got a lot, a lot of excuses
Nothing better than a homemade lie
New rules and old confusion
The ones you just despise

Out of my way, out of my reach
Out of your dream, if you still can't sleep
My mind is a terrible gift
And I'd rather be numb than feel this way

Come home with the medal, it's broken
Another fake that's another mistake
Just once, when the moment is golden
I will leave this clean

If I fail, if I fall... 
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same... 

Where do I go, and what do I do?
I'll never know if I never get through
The more I fight, I stay the same... 

Half my time and one protection
This is better than a bigger stand
New shoes in old directions
The epitaph of man

Killing my name, killing my past
Nothing's left when nothing lasts
My life is a terrible waste
And I'm going down fast

If I fail, if I fall... 
If I can't be free, then I never was at all
The more I fight, I stay the same... 

Where do I go, and what do I do?
I'll never know if I never get through
The more I fight, I stay the same... 

Oh, don't be so distracted
I can tell you where the story ends... 
New sins and old abuses
And no one wins again... 

This is my chance, this is my curse
We all know it'll only get worse
My hell is a terrible case
But I'll give you all hell first! 

If I fail, if I fall
If I can't be free then I never was it all
The more I fight I stay the same

If I still, if I stall
If I can't be hurt then I never even call
The more I fight I stay the same

Where do I go and what do I do
The very part scares the hell out of you
The more I fight I stay the same

If I fail, If I fall, If I know, If I care it all
The more I fight I stay the same
