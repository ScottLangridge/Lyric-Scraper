I find myself in wicked crest
I'm such a shitty mess
I'll catch my baited breath and lose my fucking mind
Called before the killer man
You need to understand
Psychopaths and sycophants are not a waste of time!

But all I know
Is heroes come and villains go
Just give the lunatic a chance
And all I know
Is something out is something old
I'll never win, I'm just a man
But I don't care

The deadly frost is in the green
You don't know what I mean
You'll find the Benzedrine can throw you off the edge
Who needs a therapist?
Too bad I'm not convinced
God, I'm sick of this
Just save yourself or I'll be damned

All I know
Is heroes come and villains go
Just give the lunatic a chance
And all I know
Is something out is something old
I'll never win, I'm just a man

The Conflagration isn't yours!
Your bible is a war
Once we've broken through
There's nothing to protect
Futile bullets make you weak-
Your tremors can't compete
The Human's obsolete
Whether you have lived

All I know
Is heroes come and villains go
Just give the lunatic a chance
And all I know
Is something out is something old
I'll never win, I'm just a man

All I know
Is every way you come and go
There's nothing new to understand
All I know
Is nowhere's safe and no one's home
I'll never win, I'm just a man
But I don't care

Black John is always there!
