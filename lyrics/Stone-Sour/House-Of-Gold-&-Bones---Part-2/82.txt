Oh long ago
There was a dead rat caught in a Chinese trap
And all I had to show
Where the ashes of a life that had no chance
It wasn't right, but all I could do
Was be another number that caught in the fuse
And what a lie, with nothing to lose
Something happened in nineteen-eighty-two! 

Are you the enemy?
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know it's gonna be my time
I've seen to much to keep me here
I don't want yours I just want mine

I'm never alone-
I'm always in the middle talking to myself
And all I want to know
Am I really on the road, I just can't tell
It isn't right
But all I can do is take it to a level where I can't refuse
It's a lie-
I need you to see
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know it's gonna be my time
I've seen to much to keep me here
I don't want yours I just want mine
Before I get away from here
I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here
You'll never understand to make my fate

Deep down there's a Devil inside
He can make you give up everything
Settle if you want to die
Or you can live for a world that must be free

Oh once I get away from here
I know it's gonna be my time
I've seen too much to keep me here
I don't want yours, I just want mine
Before I get away from here
I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here
You'll never understand to make my fate
Once I get away from here
Oh once I get away from here-
I know it's gonna be my time!
