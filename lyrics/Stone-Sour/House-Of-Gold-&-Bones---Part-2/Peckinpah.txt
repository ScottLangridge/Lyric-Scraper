So I'm back in the corner-
Looking at either side again
There's a terrible knowledge-
That comes from being arrogant
Don't hold your breath, just keep what's left-
You'll be justified
Reservations and revelations
Prepare to crucify!

I'm living incomplete!
I'm dying for release!
Killing extra time!
Bored of different minds!
I will decide! (Decide!)

I'm seeing what the problem is
I've got no faith left anymore
I don't know how I got here
But I'm locking every door-
So I can never leave!

Oh the seminal cowmen
Friends that show his hand again
I can see the all the exits but-
I'm missing what is evidence
Don't save the best, just leave the rest
You'll be vilified
Lamentations and calculations
I've got nothing left to hide

So now I'm living incomplete!
I'm dying for release!
Killing extra time!
Bored of different minds!
I will decide! (Decide!)

I'm seeing what the problem is
I've got no faith left anymore
I don't know how I got here
But I'm locking every door-
So I can never leave!

I'm seeing what the problem is
I've got no faith left anymore
I don't know how I got here
But I'm locking every door-
I can be a better artifact
Or I can be a better king
I should know what I'm made of
But I'm starting to believe
That I can never leave
