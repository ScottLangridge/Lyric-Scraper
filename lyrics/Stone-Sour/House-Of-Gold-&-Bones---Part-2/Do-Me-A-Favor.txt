I am an anti everything man
A scab on the lips of the lord
My caustic - dismissal
Is all I need to get you
To fall on your sword

It's easy to live fast
It's harder to live
I woke up today with a gun
Ignoring your history
Is killing your past
You might run forever
If death never lasts

So do me a favor
Your behavior
Is Just a reason why
There is no savior
When you're wasted
Let's face it
There's a side of you that
Knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy but looks like a stranger

The Bell has rung on the titans
Everybody give us some room
Your so called set of fake morals
I can't tell the difference
Is that an excuse?

The matter at hand
Is a matter of time
A sad Little kid with broken toys
Your dog matic lisense
Has kept you inside

What will you do?
When you're burning alive?

So do me a favor
Your behavior
Is Just a reason why
There is no savior
When you're wasted
Let's face it
There's a side of you that
Knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy but looks like a stranger

So do me a favor
Your behavior
Is Just a reason why
There is no savior
When you're wasted
Let's face it
There's a side of you that
Knows you're a failure
Lives for the danger
Feels like an enemy but looks like a stranger

I don't mind my old,
Dead story
And I don't want to lie to you
I know my glory
Will never be the same as truth
By now my only
Enemy is you

I won't go slowly
I'll Leave you behind
Leave you behind
I'll leave you behind
Leave you behind
