I'm walking through your streets
I'm looking in your windows
I am elemental now
You'll never even know I'm there
I'm watching over you
I'm living in the shadows
I'm just a word to you
But I am very real
And cold...
Cold to all of this
Cold to how you feel
Cold to all your lose of reason

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be...

I'm all there is to know
I'm all that you've forgotten
I'am enigmatic now
You never even knew my name
I'm dressed tragedy
I'm by design immortal
I'm just the last one left
I'm always here and old...
Old and very strong
Old as all you feel
Old as all the world around you

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be...

Re... Born

I'm just a secret now
I'm just a vague illusion
I' a lie you tell yourself
That you never truly did believe
I'm a whisper in the dark
I'm a victim and the killer
I'm almost ready now
But you insist that I don't exist...
That I don't exist...
That I don't exist...
That I don't... Exist

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be...
