GODDAMN YOU!!

Haven't let you in cause I'm in you
Haven't let you in cause I'm in you
Must have been a bitch,
Must have been a pain
Take me off the innocent
Put me in your vein!

IT'S IMPROBABLE
Yea IT'S IMPROBABLE
Haven't said a word 'cause you're still on,
Haven't said a word 'cause you're still on
Mustn't take offense, mustn't take a bow
Used to be a derelict
Now I have to live with it!

IT'S IMPROBABLE
Yea IT'S IMPROBABLE
Yea IT'S IMPROBABLE
YOU CAME BACK, BUT I KNOW BETTER BOY

Trip my light fantastic
Rub me in your wound
I'm not broken, I'm not plastic
I'm no whore...
Used against me - use me up again

IT'S IMPROBABLE
Yea IT'S IMPROBABLE
Yea IT'S IMPROBABLE
YOU CAME BACK, BUT I KNOW BETTER BOY

(sometimes I think I'm crazy; other times I know I'm not)
Got no time to time to time (once again)
Got no time to time to time (once again)
Got no time to time to time (once again)
Got no time to time to time (once again)

GOT NO TIME TO TIME TO TIME (ONCE AGAIN)
GOT NO TIME TO TIME TO TIME (ONCE AGAIN)
GOT NO TIME TO TIME TO TIME (ONCE AGAIN)
GOT NO TIME TO TIME TO TIME (ONCE AGAIN)

You don't want me, you don't need me!
YOU, DON'T, WANT, ME
YOU, DON'T, NEED, ME
