Is this wrong of me? I've come so far, so fast
I'm in the dark about a lot of things
Seems so real - to me!
I've consecrated!
I wish that I could hate it
I saw my bloody hands come clean before my eyes!

And I hear my wants and needs again, can you help me?
And I hear a different kind again, someone stop me
And I feel the strain inside my mind, am I crazy?
And I need to she'd my skin, reveal this monolith within

Visions plague my dreams - oh god, what beast did this?
I couldn't have oh jesus, I just don't know
What's inside - of me?
I've desecrated!
My god, I love to hate it!
My hands are bloody again, there's no reason why!

And I hear my wants and needs again, can you help me?
And I hear a different kind again, someone stop me
And I feel the strain inside my mind, am I crazy?
And I need to she'd my skin, reveal this monolith within

(solo: josh)

And I hear my wants and needs again, can you help me?
And I hear a different kind again, can you stop me
And I feel the strain inside my mind, am I crazy?
And I need to she'd my skin, reveal this monolith within

Within!
