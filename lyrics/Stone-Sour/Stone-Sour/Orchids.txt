You hold me inside your iris
Like a terminal stain on life
You condescend to my primal brain
And twist me around like a knife

Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you

Don't - try to be the one - person
Who has stayed - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
God, I never learn

You keep me hidden behind a curtain,
An audible human display
You feed me orchids to give me courage
And keep me in line with disdain

Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you

Don't - try to be the one - person
Who has stayed - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
God, I never learn

I have nothing left for you
You left me with nothing

I live at arm's length and die a little,
Between your constants by day
I want my soul back before it's over,
I can't even wish you away

Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you

Don't - try to be the one - person
Who has stayed - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
God, I never learn

I never learn!!
