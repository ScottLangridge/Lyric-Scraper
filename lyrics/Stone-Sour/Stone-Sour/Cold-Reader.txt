I can only hurt your case
It's written on your face
You always come to me
I won't be used, but

I - can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up the door, oh

No! I won't! I can't! not anymore!
One more time and I think I'll fucking die!
Why? do I always have to suffer the consequences?

Stay away from who I am
'cause I know what you are
I can't believe you're here
Then again, you know that

I - can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul, oh

No! I won't! I can't! not anymore!
One more time and I think I'll fucking die!
Why? do I always have to suffer the consequences?

Stop I know your goddamn game
It's always been the same
The story hasn't changed
Neither will you, but

I - can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul

No! I won't! I can't! not anymore!
One more time and I think I'll fucking die!
Why? do I always have to suffer the consequences?
