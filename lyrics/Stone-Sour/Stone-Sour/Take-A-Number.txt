Never even knew
What you meant to convey
You handed us a retrospect
'til you didn't have a thing to say
No one questions you
Even someone set out to do
Now it's nothing
But dead and gone

Let's go [x4]

Better with a lie
Than the world's ever seen you wanted all the recognition
Until you lost the means
No one talks to you
Even someone set out to do
Take a number your time has come

'cause you're another one!
You're another soul to feed
To the man's machine!

My excuses lay me down
My emotions make me drown
My endeavor takes blame
At least I have a name

'cause you're another one!
You're another soul to feed
To the man's machine!
