Let's go!
I only wanted, only wanted just to touch you
I couldn't bear it, couldn't bear it if you leave
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter if I scare you
I only wanted, only wanted someone else's skin
To feel you there
To Touch my face
To Keep me whole
Help me see------ my high life
Give me your life... Yeah

I didn't wanna, didn't wanna be the first one
I haven't ever, haven't ever been discreet
It isn't over, isn't over by a long shot
I didn't wanna, didn't wanna be the only one
To feel you there
To Touch your face
To Keep you whole
Help you see------ my high life
Give me your life

Incredible... And chemical

Before I show you where the secret is
I want to turn you into this
I want to give you all my nothingness
I want to cover you with this

See my life... Give me your life
Let me see... My life
Give me - your life
Incredible... And chemical
