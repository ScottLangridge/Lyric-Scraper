(This record is an unseen enemy of the human mind)

(Listen only to my voice)
(One word of caution)
(Ru486)

The pity turns complacent
The fear gives it a rush
Nobody needs a hopeless romantic
Who never sleeps and dreams too much
The fear is unrepentant
Their face has nowhere to hide!
So draw a breath, and kill my Judas
You'll never know until you come inside!

You are defeatist
Forsaken
A jewel in the crown of the Sun
Never repeated, or taken
I wouldn't change a fuckin' thing that you've done

(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Are you 486?

Another weak contender
Another pound of the nails
The future lies in perfect condition
You can't do it if you're built to fail!
I only know solutions
I've never thought of the end
Someone else is closing the casket
Another hungry mouth to defend!

You are defeated
Forbidden
A name at the top of the list
Never related, or stricken
I wouldn't change a fuckin' thing about this!

(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Are you 486?

(You!)
Projector
(Won't!)
Suspector
(Feel!)
The victor, it's only who is left to say
(You!)
Contractor
(Don't!)
Detractor
(See!)
The answer!
It's screaming what you'll never say!

(Solos: Josh & Jim)

We are demeaning!
Forever!
A world that will never exist
Always repeating, or severed!
We wouldn't change a fuckin' thing about this!

(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Are you 486?

(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Assume your nemesis!
(Goin' down alive)
(Goin' down alive)
Are you 486?
