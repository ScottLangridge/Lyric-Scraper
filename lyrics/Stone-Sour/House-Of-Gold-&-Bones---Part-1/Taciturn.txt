Across the sea to you
I've left myself deserted here again
Across the sea to you
My pieces are too broken now to mend

In the middle
Under a cold, black sky
The sun will only burn for you and I
In the moment...
Before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything
This time...

Give me a sign
Show me the light
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the light
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Across the world for you
My reasons have no reasons to remain
I'd cross the world for you
I don't know what I'm doing wrong
But I can stay the same

In the middle
Under a clear blue sky
The sun can only burn for you and I
In the moment
Before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything
This time...

Give me a sign
Show me the light
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the light
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the light
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the light
Maybe tonight
I'll tell you everything

Everything
Oh...
