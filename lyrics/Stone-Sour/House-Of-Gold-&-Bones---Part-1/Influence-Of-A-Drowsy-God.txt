All those times before
When I was just another face
Among the others
Keeping secrets to save myself

I could blend into the background
And savor the unknown
I could practice preservation
And hide behind this shell

But my God's unleashed
On a world that is falling down
My call is a beast that will not
Let me give up now
I know I'm all or nothing

Giving my illation
A little something to relax
All the others and decisions
Will make me go mad

There's no time to hear the arguments
Or simply close my eyes
I believe this confrontation
Deserves my full attention

When my God's unleashed on a world
That is falling down
My call is a beast that will not
Let me give up now
I know I'm all or nothing
I'm all or nothing

(Solo: Josh)

I can see why nothing has happened
Promises strain
I'm writing this down as I run
Take all the examples
And what have I learned?
Nothing can heal you
And everything burns!

My God's unleashed on a world
That is falling down
My call is a beast that will not
Let me give up now
I'm all or nothing
I'm all or nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
