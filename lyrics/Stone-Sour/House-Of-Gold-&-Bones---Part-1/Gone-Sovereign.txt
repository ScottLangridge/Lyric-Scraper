[Intro]

[Verse 1]
No one's laughing now
No one's laughing now
I'm sullen and sated
And you can't put a price on me

[Verse 2]
I won't share this disarray
I won't pull these hands away
I need to be chosen
And my God, don't pray for me!

[Pre-Chorus]
So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

[Hook]
This is mine!

[Bridge]
Come no further
You'll go too far!
I'm running round in circles once again
If you can't forgive me
I won't take it very hard
But I won't make it easy in the end

[Chorus]
So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the contended will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

[Hook 2]
This is mine!
This is mine!
Yeah!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive!

[Hook 3]
This is mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!

[Outro]
