[Verse 1]
These visions in your vapor make you more and less
Keeping chaos is a chore today
But that murder in your sorrow bellows smoke and death
I wonder what the neighbors will think of to say?

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunderstorms, banging on my windows
Chloroform, sticking to my face and head
Careful now, a symbol is a promise
Going down, going down in flames before the crash
We get you home
It's nothing serious
It's just the space between the sword and stone

[Chorus]
Only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know
We know the riddle but the answer is mine
'Cause only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know
We know the future is another Friday Knight

[Verse 2]
Exquisite in absentia and divine inside
Can your differences come out to play?
And when did all your heroes take the goddamn blame?
When did all the villains catch all the breaks?

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunderstorms, banging on my windows
Chloroform, sticking to my face and head
Careful now, a symbol is a promise
Going down, going down in flames again

[Chorus]
Only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know
We know the riddle but the answer is mine
'Cause only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know
We know the future is another Friday Knight

[Breakdown]
Yeah!
Soft quotation never sounds as real
Confrontation always makes you feel before the crash
We get you home
It's nothing serious
It's just the space between the sword and stone

[Chorus]
Only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know
We know the riddle but the answer is mine
'Cause only the ones left over
Will ever get it right
We all know
We know the future is another Friday Knight
