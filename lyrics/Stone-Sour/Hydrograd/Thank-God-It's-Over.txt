[Verse 1]
None of us are innocent, we take what we can get
It doesn't matter if it hurts to get back down
Greedy little prodigies, disposable celebrities
Another social disease, another pitiful now
Don't talk, you just won't listen
Don't worry, oh, you gotta wait and see

[Chorus]
I'll get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me

[Verse 2]
Bleeding out the bitterness, balance your common sense
Why am I the only one who's never afraid?
I never wanted to eliminate a generation that can't be saved
Don't believe it, you're the fucking ones to blame
Don't try, it just won't happen
Don't worry, oh, you gotta wait and see

[Chorus]
I'll get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me

[Chorus]
Oj, I'll get what's coming to me
Thank God it's over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
Now that the worst is over
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
I'm gonna get what's coming to me
I'm gonna get what's coming to...
