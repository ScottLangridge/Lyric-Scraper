[Verse 1]
Every time I fall
I'm a little less me and a little bit more you
And everywhere I go
There's a little less there and a little bit more to lose
Did you ever wonder why?
I can't decide if I'm a little bit dead or a little bit guarded
'Cause even when I try
You and I are a little less there and just discarded

[Pre-Chorus]
If we collapse under all the weight
Of our self-importance, what if it's too late?

[Chorus]
I threw it all away, it doesn't make it better
Why am I the ostracized?
Maybe I can change if I put it back together
If I'm right, then I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
Even if I could
I'll never be free from a little bit more than this
It won't do any good
Any other way is a little bit more to risk
But I say "Fuck it, risk it!"

[Pre-Chorus]
If we collapse, only time will tell
Obey the same disorders and ride your ass to Hell

[Chorus]
I threw it all away, it doesn't make it better
Why am I the ostracized?
Maybe I can change if I put it back together
If I'm right, then I don't wanna know

(Know, know, know, know, know ...)

[Instrumental, Solo Guitar]

[Chorus]
I threw it all away, it doesn't make it better
Why am I the ostracized?
Maybe I can change if I put it back together
If I'm right, then I don't wanna know

[Outro]
Then I don't wanna know!
I don't wanna know!
Know, know, know!
