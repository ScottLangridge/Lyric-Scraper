[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
My best is pointless, outrun but I'll never win
This state of conflict makes sense, don't think about it
I ran away when I was 15, I was dead by 17
I know the world owes me everything
I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna make it

[Chorus]
Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
I guess I'm just another demon of mercy

[Verse 2]
All talk, no action, completely incomplete
Why wish me well when I know exactly what you think?
I came alive when I was 18, you forget, I'm everything
I know the world owes me nothing
So I'll take it if I can make it

[Chorus]
Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
Your God's a weapon, he blessed every bullet
Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
I guess I'm just another demon of mercy
Yeah!

[Bridge]
Tell me anything, tell me anything
Overrated and underappreciated
Anything, tell me anything
Before you know it, youll be...

[Chorus]
Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now I'm here
Not a name for what I am
Your God's a weapon, he blessed every bullet
Walking on the warmer stones
Going nowhere, now Im here
Not a name for what I am
I guess I'm just another demon of mercy
