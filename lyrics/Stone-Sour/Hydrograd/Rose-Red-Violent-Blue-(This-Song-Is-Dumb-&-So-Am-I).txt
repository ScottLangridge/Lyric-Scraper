[Verse 1]
Excuse me, oh pardon me I'm still sticky on the inside
There comes a time where all I do
Is sit around in contemplation and curse my situation
I'm just too bored for normal views
Be careful of what you wish for, impossible to just ignore
One last time is all I need
To get my laughing stocks in order, they're on the rise this quarter
Beware of certain friends who sell you out when everything is free
I know what I am to all of you
And I've got all these other things to do, to do

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough, I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old now

[Verse 2]
Imagine this chaos theory makes all the prophets leery
Somebody's showing them the ropes
We use to hang ourselves with
Instead of quiet respites, we choose the noose in lieu of hope
Oh, rose red, oh, violent blue, I should've seen the clues
But this song is dumb and so am I
Character assassinations aren't really observations
Stay home and ask yourself: why am I so low when I'm so high, so high

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough, I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old now

[Bridge]
Yeah!
Come on!

[Chorus]
Open up, I know enough, I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only youth
But I am much too old, I am much too old
I am much too old, I am much too old
