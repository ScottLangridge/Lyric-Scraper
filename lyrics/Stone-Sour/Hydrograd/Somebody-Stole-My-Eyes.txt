[Verse 1]
Waiting for the end of the world, stop
We know just what to do
Sit in the back, ready to rat
Fuck this, fuck that, and fuck you too
Gods and monsters, what do you need?
Can't wait to watch you bleed
Putting on my blue suede shoes and dancing on your fucking grave

[Break]
Who said? You'll feel me in the end
Just then, somebody stole my eyes again

[Verse 2]
I am a rock and roll Han Solo
The only one around
I am a bastard and a scoundrel
Shooting first and going down
The anime arithmetic will show you what I mean
Turning septicemic from the shit that's in between
Repent, we haven't seen you since
But then, it's upside down again
I know it's only fluid, the devil made me do it
But God could've stopped me

[Chorus]
I know it's only after midnight
We've still got time to have a good fight
So hit me back with all you can
I know it's only what you wanted
Love's so much better when you're hunted
Somebody stole my eyes again
Somebody stole my eyes

[Verse 3]
Running around and about, nothing around and about
Looking around, I can't see
What in the world am I, how did I ever die
Something I loved is now dead
What is wrong with you?
Coming to see you soon, I can hardly wait
Murder another man
Killer of Caliban, catatonic state

[Chorus]
I know it's only after midnight
We've still got time to have a good fight
So hit me back with all you can
I know it's only what you wanted
Love's so much better when you're hunted
Somebody stole my eyes again
Stole my eyes

[Outro]
Rob me blind
