[Verse 1]
Looking around, I can see what's going on
By the way, it didn't take too long
What you do while I was on the line?
Spend your free time wasting mine
Living in the chaos, sleeping in the shit
Evidence proves that you don't really get it
When you're finished just taking up space
Wipe that face off your goddamn face and

[Pre-Chorus]
Smile
Everybody seems to think it's too soon to think, but
Smile
Someday you'll have to stand on your own two feet, so

[Chorus]
Sometimes you think you know it all
Until you find you never knew a thing
You never knew a thing
Just when you think you have it all
Then you find you never had a thing
You see the door but you leave with nothing

[Verse 2]
You could be the one on duty
Time to wake up, Sleeping Beauty
Fucking around all day
The house gives and it taketh away
Walking in the pigsty, running on the coals
You're gonna love it when your luck unfolds
Nobody there to provide you, ride you
Clean you up and gently remind you

[Pre-Chorus]
Smile
Everybody does everything and anything for you
Smile
You better be prepared when we start to ignore you

[Chorus]
Sometimes you think you know it all
Until you find you never knew a thing
You never knew a thing
Just when you think you have it all
Then you find you never had a thing
You see the door but you leave with nothing

[Breakdown]
Come get your shit
Come get your shit
Come and get your shit
Come, get your shit

[Verse 3]
Have I ever told you anything that never came true?
Motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you
You think you're getting through and making a dent
But same shit, different damn event
Go ahead, keep it up, see if I care
What do I know? I've only already been there
Do what you want but you better be fast
Hard to see the world with your head up your ass, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Smile
Everybody's gonna know that you're in over your head
Smile
'Cause you never fucking listen to a word we've said

[Chorus]
Sometimes you think you know it all
Until you find you never knew a thing
You never knew a thing
Just when you think you have it all
Then you find you never had a thing
You see the door but you leave with nothing
Sometimes you think you know it all
Until you find you never knew a thing
You never knew a thing
Just when you think you have it all
Then you find you never had a thing
Before you fucking leave

[Outro]
Come get your shit
Come get your shit
Come and get your shit
Come get your shit
Fuck
