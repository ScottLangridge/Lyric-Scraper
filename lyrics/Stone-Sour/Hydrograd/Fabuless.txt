[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't recall the last time I was caught between the walls
Those razors in the pillowcases seem to cut 'em all
But old foes, dead things, take a toll
Remember, it's just a game

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's only rock and roll but I like it, like it
Don't talk - walk, don't feel - real
Don't stay - say, you'll need it anyway

[Chorus]
Oh, it's my own damn fault
I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Because it's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill, you can't get home from here

[Verse 2]
Your beast is just a burden that you never keep in line
This 'fabulous' is really less, gets 'em every time
You roll your eyes for money, don't act like you're impressed
You spread your legs for TV time, baby, who fucks you best?

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's only rock and roll but I like it, like it
Don't talk - walk, don't feel - real
Don't stay - say, you'll need it anyway

[Chorus]
Oh, it's my own damn fault
I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Because it's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill, you can't get home from here

[Chorus]
Oh, it's my own damn fault
I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Admit it, when you fall
You'll make peace with your gravity
We all know it drives you mad, mad, mad
Because it's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
It's all downhill from here
You can't get home from here
You can't get home from here
You can't get home from here
You can't get home from here
