I've a feeling that I know you (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
Tell me have you ever seen me (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
I hear, I see - have you seen me
Through it all I've been here without you (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
Tell me have you ever seen me (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)

Words seem out of place, all my life I've known your face
Have you ever seen me, have you ever seen me

Many flowers are breaking through the concrete (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
Listen everybody I can hear them breathing (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
I hear, I see - have you seen me
I felt I got a feeling that I know you (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
I got to know - have you ever seen me (heyr-heyr, heyr-heyr-heyr-heyr)
