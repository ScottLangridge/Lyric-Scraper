I see the sunshine, the sunshine sees me
I feel the breezes off of the sea
The palm trees are waving
The sand is so warm
But I'm only dreaming
I'm dreaming alone

Eddie's dreaming (always dreaming)
Eddie's dreaming (always dreaming)

I'm eating banana, my friends sit around
I tell them my stories
They won't make a sound
The girls they'll be dancing
To the beat of the foam
I'll smoke and I'll watch them
When I'm back home
