If the smile on my face
Doesn't mean much any more
Then it's all been just a waste of time
So wont you close your door
But when I look into your eyes
I feel there's still something there
And something's all I need to hold on to
I can lie to myself
I still care
I still care about the way...
And the little things you say
Won't you please come out to play
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming
What good does dreaming do, when you're nowhere?
I got nobody to hold on to,
But I keep on smiling, crying
See me walking down the street
Just turn your head and walk away
Cause by now you ought to know how I feel
And there's no more
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming
Oh, yeah
Got to know what I mean
(lyrics continue, but fade)
