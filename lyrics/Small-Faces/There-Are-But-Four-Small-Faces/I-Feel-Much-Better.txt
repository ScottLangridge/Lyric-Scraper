Easy and lazy we go
It seems so hazy and slow
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy)
Long before the long before we know
(Shanga-langa-langa-dulang)
Times were so high they were low

I'm only writing the rhyme
Don't find me taking my time
Please pass me my glass of wine
I feel much better
I feel much better
I feel much
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy)
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy)
Please feel at home to come and go
(Shanga-langa-langa-dulang)
Easy and lazy and slow
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy)
Smiling so nicely to know
(Shanga-langa-langa-dulang)
Winds of good fortune must blow your way

These things won't come in a day
These things are coming to stay
There's really not much to say
I feel much better
I feel much better
I feel much
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy)
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy)
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy) slowly
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy) slowly feeling
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy) slowly feeling
(Shoop-shoop-doo-weddy-weddy) slowly feeling

Oh yeah, come on, now, ooh
