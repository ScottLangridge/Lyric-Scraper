I like the way your sparkling earrings lay against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight with a billion stars all around
'cause I got a peaceful easy feeling, and I know you won't let me down
'cause I'm already standing on the ground

And I found out a long time ago what a woman can do to your soul
Ah, but she can't take you anyway you don't already know how to go
And, I got a peaceful easy feeling and I know you won't let me down
'cause I'm already standing on the ground

I get this feeling I may know you as a lover and a friend
But, this voice keeps whispering in my other ear - [it] tells me I may never see you again
'cause I got a peaceful easy feeling, and I know you won't let me down
'cause I'm already standing -
I'm already standing -
Yes, I'm already standing on the ground
