Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on

A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be

Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer,
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
Maybe I'll go to santa fe, maybe san antone,
Any town is where I'm bound any way to get me gone
Don't think about me, never let me cross your mind
'cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine

Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
