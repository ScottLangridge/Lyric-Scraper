There's a heart on the line, and it rests with your eyes
Please don't fade and please don't cry, 'cause it's all white lies
Take a chance watch it fall, grab too much and lose it all
Now i've lost my disguise, it was all white lies

Stay here, lie here with me, oh lo-fi, lonley sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide

Would it help if I tried, or has it sailed and passed me by
First love grows then it does, and it's all white lies

Stay here, lie here with me, oh lo-fi, lonley sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide with me

Now you move with the tide and ive heard you've found peace of mind
And I know that life's design moves around white lies, white lies, white lies, white lies
