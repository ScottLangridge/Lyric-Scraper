Back off loneliness, and hello tenderness
I've been waiting for your call for so long
It must've been hard just to follow your soul
To stick to the road that your heart wants you to go
And as you slide through the door
With your morals on your sleeve
I think it's time for all those morals to leave
So let's get down and freaky baby
Let's get restless baby, come on get crazy with me.

And I said
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on.

So many people think we've got it wrong
They all try to break us but we won't play along
So let's get down and dirty baby
Let's get restless baby, come on get crazy with me.

And I said
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
I love the prowess in the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on, oh goin' on.

I was so stranded
I was lost and abandoned
I needed another home
You fly in my arms, you just fly right into my arms.

When you're loving me, I'm loving you
I love the prowess in all the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
And when you're loving me, I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on.

When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And I love the prowess in all the things that you do
And it's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on.

On and on
On and on

It's your flawless soul that bleeds my stone
When you're loving me, I'm loving you
And that's when we've got it goin' on.
