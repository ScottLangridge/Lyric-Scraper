Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was
Something missing
In my day to day life
So I
Quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes that were ripped around the seams
And I thought
These shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said
Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm
Running late and I don't need an excuse to wear in my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I
Felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
As I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
A room full of all my friends
All dancing 'round and 'round
And I thought
Hello new shoes
Bye bye blues

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said

Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm
Running late and I don't need an excuse to wear in my brand new shoes

Take me wondering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking till the break of dawn

Take me wondering through these streets
