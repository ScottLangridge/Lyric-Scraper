You gotta keep em coming
Ye coz she's in fashion, she's chic

She's in fashion, le freak

N she's a my queen.

There's more to life than sex appeal
But sometimes it takes more than an angel to remember
Oh and this lady she's a real deal.
On the cover from December to December
Though her eyes reveal her vanity
She's got soul, she's got class, and originality.
She's got style
And a personality and she wears it on her sleeve
Coz she's in fashion, she's chic
