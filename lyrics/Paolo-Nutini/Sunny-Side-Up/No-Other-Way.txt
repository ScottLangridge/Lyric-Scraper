Darlin'
My frustration
It gets me, it gets me where it hurts me most.
Like five rapid to the gut it's not so easy to see.
And I've been gone far, far too long
To expect you not to change even a little bit
And I guess I hope I'm still the kind of guy
Your needin for your fool.

Cuz life's a bowl here on the road and these four wheels
Oh but something about the whole thing
It doesn't feel real

Work my days for you
Cuz I love you girl, I don't want you
I need you
And I can't see no other way

Darlin'
I work my days for you
Cuz I love you girl, I don't want you
I need you
And I can't see no other way

Ohhhhh this separation
It really gets you thinkin
And all those used up clichs
Well they've worn off in the wind
And I, I wonder if your half as innocent as you assure me
Or if you thank him for his time and just never call again

Oh oh
And after all the lights and shows and long hope lanes
It'd be you and me again
But until then

I work my days for you
Cuz I love you girl, I don't want you
I need you
I can't see no other way

Oh darlin'
I work my days for you
Cuz I love you girl, I don't want you
I need you
And I can't see no other way

Oohh live
I'm home
So love me
And I'm home babe
Oh so touch me

Yeah
I'm home
So kiss me, like you do
Kiss me babe
Babyy
But I'll do it for you

Ohh babe, yeaahhh babyyy
I want you babe
I'm, I'm home babe
So take me in your arms
Oh babe, baby
Love me like you do
Oh kiss me like you do
And baby you bet I'll do it for you
Ohh nooo
Hold me like you do
