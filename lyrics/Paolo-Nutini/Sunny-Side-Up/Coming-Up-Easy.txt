Sunday morning go the hazy, hazy jeans
I turn to you and inhale where you lay.
Took a wonder through the garden,
To awake the long long day
And then roll of a while on violet flower bed.

Oh, you kiss my lips again and again and again
And then again and then we watched the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down
And it watched our bodies so cleanly
We could see them rise up off of the cold cold ground.

It's a shame the way it's seems to go
Cause now my best friend, my partner in crime
I'm afraid it looks like we're
Gonna have to go our separate ways.
You see the thing is I love you, I love you
But you see I resent you all the time.
All my other friends their just saying
Your slowing me down.

Oh I should have known
You'd turn to me and say
Before you throw too much of me away.
Don't you remember seeing the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down.
And it washed out bodies so cleanly
Seen them rise up off of the cold cold ground.

We seen the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down
And it washed our bodies so clean
We could feel them rise up off of the cold cold ground.

It was in love I was created
And in love is how I hope I die (repeated)
