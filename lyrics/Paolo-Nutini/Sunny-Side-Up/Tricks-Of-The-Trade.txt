Well I looked for recognition
That would heal this man's condition
Oh! I'm hoping and I'm wishing
That this bird wont fly away

We can see life hand in hand
The green the blue, the rough, the sand
And in our time and in our land
We'll savour every day

Though our glory may fade, babe,
Well, at least we learned some things along the way

Oh! You took me from my bubble [?]
When my defence was weak
And you sat there and you listened
Anytime I chose to speak

Oh! And you gathered from my pleas to you
That I am but a clown
And I fear only a hero
Can defeat these demons now

And oh! How our glory may fade, babe,
Well, at least we learned some tricks of the trade

And as time shall inevitably move on
Hmm, well, at least we'll have
Four strong legs to stand on

To keep us alive
