Skip de skip, up the road
Off to school we go
"don't you be a bad boy johnny
Don't you slip up
Or play the fool"
"oh no ma, oh no da,
I'll be your golden boy
I will obey ev'ry golden rule"
Get told by the teacher
Not to day-dream
Told by my mother:

Be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good be good (johnny)
Be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good (johnny)
Be good be good.

"are you going to play football this year, john? "
"no!"
"oh, well you must be going to play cricket this year then,
Are you johnny? "
"no! no! no!"
"boy, you sure are a funny kid, johnny, but I like you! So tell me,
What kind of a boy are you, john? "

I only like dreaming
All the day long
Where no one is screaming

Be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good be good (johnny)
Be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Be good be good be good
Johnny!
