Maria was born in the country
She loved her homeland
Maria was from a poor family
For their girl they had greater plans

Across the sea not yet twenty
Sailed our maria, a man to see
Perhaps marry dreams our maria
This was to be eventually for our maria

Maria made plans for the future
Sh had sons to her man
Maria grew sad as the years passed
She did not understand
You must believe me
Though it's not easy, trust in me
My life's been wasted
There's nothing sacred I can see
Though we're together
It seems we've never known the way
These lives we started
Now broken hearted everyday

Maria works in the factory
She makes shoes for the man
Maria lives for her family
Now she does what she can.

Hold on to me
Hold on to me maria
For this was to be
A tragedy for our maria

Oh maria don't you cry
Oh maria dry your eyes
