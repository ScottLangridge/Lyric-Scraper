Somebody's screaming
Looking at the ceiling oh oh oh
Everything's so funny
I don't have any money oh oh oh
People don't even know me
But they know how to show me oh oh oh

Why can't you be nicer to me?

My pride is dying
I think I'm all done lying oh oh oh
Nobody's sharing
So I stop caring oh oh oh
All alone and walking
Nobody's talking oh oh oh

Why can't you be nicer to me?

Well the wind is blowing
Where am I going oh oh oh
Off a bridge and falling
Nobody's calling oh oh oh
On the ground and laying
Nobody's praying oh oh oh

Why can't you be nicer to me?
