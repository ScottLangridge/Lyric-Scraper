We started living in an old house
My mind gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy
So we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun
And it was 1981

We named him "Baby"
He had a toothache
He started crying
It sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long
Because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll
Stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family
And we're alright now
We got money and a little place
To fight now
We don't know you
And we don't owe you
But if you see us around
I got something else to show you

Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy?
Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm
But there's just something wrong with ya
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

I had opinion that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog
And a box with something in it

The hardest button to button (x4)
Ah oh

The hardest button to button (x2)
Ah oh

The hardest button to button (x4)
Ah oh
