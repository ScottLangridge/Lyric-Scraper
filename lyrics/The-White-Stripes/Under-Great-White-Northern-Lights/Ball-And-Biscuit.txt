It's quite possible that I'm your third man girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It's quite possible that I'm your third man girl
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
And right now you could care less about me
But soon enough you will care, by the time I'm done

Let's have a ball and a biscuit sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball girl
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everyone in the place just to get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it

You read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
You read it in the newspaper
Ask your girlfriends and see if they know
That my strength is ten fold girl
And I'll let you see if you want to before you go

Let's have a ball and a biscuit sugar
And take our sweet little time about it
Let's have a ball
And take our sweet little time about it
Tell everyone in the place just to get out
We'll get clean together
And I'll find me a soapbox where I can shout it
And I've one or two things to say about it... Alright listen

It's quite possible that I'm your third man
But it's a fact that I'm the seventh son
It was the other two which/was made me your third
But it was my mother who made me the seventh son
And right now you could care less about me
But soon enough you will care by the time I'm done
