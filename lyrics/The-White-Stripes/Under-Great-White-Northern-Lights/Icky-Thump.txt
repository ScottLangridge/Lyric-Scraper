Icky
Thump Who'da
Thunk Sittin'?
Drunk On
A wagon to Mexico Ahh

Well what, a chump Well
My head Got
A bump When
I hit it on the radio Red-head

Senorita Lookin'
Dead Came
To said "Need,
A bed" en espanol I

Said "Gimme
A drink a water I'm,
Gonna 'sing around the collar' And
I don't need a microphone ". Icky

Thump With,
A lump in my throat Grabbed
My coat And
I was freaking I
Was ready to go And!

I swear Besides
The hair She
Had one white eye One
Blank stare Looking
Up Lying,
There On

The stand Near
Her hand Was
A candy cane Black
Rum sugar, cane Dry
Ice and something strange La

La la la la la la La
La la la la la la White

Americans what, Nothing?
Better to do Why?
Don't you kick yourself out You're?
An immigrant too Who's.

Using who What?
Should we do Well?
You can't be a pimp And
A prostitute too Icky

Thump handcuffed, to a bunk Robbed
Blind Looked
Around And
There was nobody else Left

Alone I
Hit myself with a stone Went
Home And
Learned how to clean up after myself
