Meg:
Rag and bone!

Jack:
Rag and bone!

Meg:
Rag and bone!

Jack:
Rag and bone!
Meg, look at this place

Meg:
What? Whoo!

Jack:
This place is like a mansion!
It's like a mansion!
Look at all this stuff!

Meg:
I don't know.

Jack:
Look, I see something over there.
Man...

Well can't you hear we're selling rag and bone?
Bring out your junk and we'll give it a home
A broken trumpet or a telephone
Come on, come on, come on, come on and give it to me

Yeah

Come on, come on, come on, come on and give it to me
Rag and bone
Rag and bone
Come on, come on, come on, come on and give it to me

I'll have your pretty
Your pretty little rags and bones

Well, man, look at all this.
You don't want it?

Meg:
What is that?

Jack:
You sure you don't want it?
If it's just things that you don't want, I can use 'em
Meg can use 'em.
We can do something with 'em.
We'll make something out of 'em.
Make some money out of 'em, at least.
Hey, if you ain't gonna use it, just give it to us.
We'll give it a home.

Well, have they got something shiny for me?
Anybody got a Christmas tree?
Can you part with a toilet seat?
A jump up, a jump up, a jump up, come on and give it to me

Rag and bone

We wanna get it, granny, while it's hot
You think it's trash, granny, but it's not
We'll be taking whatever you got
A give up, a give up, a give up, come on and give it to me
Whoo!
All of your pretty, your pretty little rags and bones

Meg:
I saw some stuff in your yard, are you gonna give it to us?

Jack:
Aww, Meg, don't be rude.

Meg:
Or not...

Jack:
They might need it.
If you don't want it, we'll take it; if you don't want to give it to us, we keep walking by.
Keep going, we're not tired.
Got plenty of places to go, lots of homes we ain't been to yet.
West side, southwest side, middle-east, rich house, dog house, outhouse, old folks house
House for unwed mothers, halfway homes, catacombs, twilight zones.
Looking for techniques, turntables to gramophones.
So take a last lick of your ice cream cone.
And lock up what you still want to own.
But please be kind.
And don't rewind.
All of your pretty, your pretty little rags and bones.
Yeah!
Your pretty little rags and bones
Jump up, jump up, jump up, come on and give it to me
Oh, your pretty little rags and bones
Come on, come on, come on, come on and give it to us
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!

Meg:
Yeah!

Both:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah!
