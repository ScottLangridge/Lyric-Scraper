Hey
Look closer and you see
I will be running it
I got a hundred dollar bill
In the cockpit
Suprised me in the line
Is a blackhole
I got another job
At the liquor store

Damn
Oh well
I'm broke boke

They got a white pony
In the stable
And ride him
When the doggie isn't able
He doesn't really care
Because they pay him
But still a black suit
Is gonna shake him

Down
Oh well
I'm bone broke
Yeh
As broke as i'll ever be

Looking at the way girl
I'm telling ya
God gave 7 minutes right too ya
And your mother put her money into platinum
And now you never have to pay attention

Do ya?

Yeh
I'm nailing on a brick
With my nails
I'm sending loads of moneys
In the mail
Keep shouting in my box yeh for saying
And the the brick breakers
Gonna break it down

Oh well
I'm bone broke

Looking at the way girl
I'm telling ya
God gave 7 minutes right too ya
Your mother put her money into platinum
So that you wouldn't have to pay attention
