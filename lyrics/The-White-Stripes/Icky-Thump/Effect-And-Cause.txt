I guess you have to have a probelm
If you want to 'vent a contraption
Well you cause a trainwreck
And then you put me in traction
First came an action
And then a reaction
But you can't switch around
For your own satisfaction
Well you burnt my house down
And then got mad at my reaction

Well in every complicated situation
There's a human relation
To make sense of it all
Take a whole lot of concentration
Well you can't blame her baby
For her pregnant ma
And if there's one of these
On her auto applause

It's just that you can't just take the effect and make it the cause

Well you can't take the effect
And make it the cause
I didn't rob a bank
Cos you made up the law
Blame me for robbing peter
Don't you blame paul
Can't take the effect
And make it the cause

I ain't the reason that you gave me
No reason to return your call
You built a house of cards
And got shocked when you saw them fall
Well I ain't saying I'm innocent
In fact the reverse
But if your heading to the grave
Don't blame the hearse
You're like a little girl yelling at her brother
Cos you lost his ball

You keep blaming me for what you did
And that ain't all
The way you clean up the wreck
Is enough to give one pause
You seem to forget just how this song started
I'm reacting to you
Cos you left me broken hearted

It's just that you can't just take the effect and make it the cause

Well you can't take the effect
And make it the cause
I didn't rob a bank
Cos you made up the law
Blame me for robbing peter
Don't you blame paul
Can't take the effect
And make it the cause
