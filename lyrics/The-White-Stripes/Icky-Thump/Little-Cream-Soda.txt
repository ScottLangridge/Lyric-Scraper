Well, every highway that I go down seems to be longer than the last one that I knew about
Oh, well

Yeah, and every girl that I walk around seems to be more of an illusion than the last one that I found
Oh, well

And this old man in front of me, wearing canes and ruby rings, is like a tangy explosion when he sings
With every chance to set himself on fire he just ends up doing the same thing

Well, each beautiful thing I come across tells me to start moving and shake this riddle off
Oh, well

And there was a time when all I wanted was my ice cream cone and a little cream soda
Oh, well, oh, well

And a wooden box and alley full of rocks was all I had to care about
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well

Now my mind is filled with rubber tires and forest fires and whether
I'm a liar and lots of other situations where I don't know what to do at which time
God screams to me "There's nothing left for me to tell you"
"Nothing left for me to tell you"
"Nothing left"
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well
Oh, well
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well
Oh, well
