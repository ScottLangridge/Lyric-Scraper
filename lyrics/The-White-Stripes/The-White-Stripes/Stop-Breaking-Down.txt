Everytime I'm walkin', down the streets,
Some pretty mama she starts breakin' down
Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo,
It'll make you lose your mind.

Now, you Saturday night women's, you love to ape and clown,
You won't do nothin' but tear good man (i. E Jack White) reputation down
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo,
It'll make you lose your mind

Now, I give my baby, now, the ninety-nine degree,
She jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me
Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down
Stuff I got'll bust your brains out, if you think you lose your mind
