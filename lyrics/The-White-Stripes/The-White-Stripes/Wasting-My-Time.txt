And if I'm wasting my time
Then nothing could be better
Than hanging on the line
And waiting for a honest word forever

And if you're saying goodbye
Please don't you think me bitter
For recalling every rhyme
From the book the page the line the word the letter

Well the windows turning blue
And the waters over flowing
And I hope I'm not a fool
For laughing at myself as you were going
