(Mark Knopfler / David Knopfler)

There's a shadow hanging over the valley
Total eclipse of the moon
Closing up the gates of the city
The wind plays a wild storm

Don't you put the lock upon the window
Don't you put the bar on the door
Don't you cry for the rain in the sky
You seen the storm before

Well, what's the matter with you baby
Baby, what's the matter now
Tell me what's the matter you running in the shadows
Every time you hear the wild man howl

C'mon, tell me what's the matter with you babe
Baby, what's the matter now
What's the matter now you running in the shadows
Every time you hear the wild man howl

Lightning gonna strike at midnight
Thunder gonna shake it around
Don't you flinch don't give an inch
Just a-let the flood come down

C'mon, tell me what's the matter with you babe
Baby, what's the matter now
What's the matter now you running in the shadows
Every time you hear the wild man howl

C'mon, tell me what's the matter with you babe
Baby, what's the matter now
What's the matter now you running in the shadows
Every time you hear the wild man howl
