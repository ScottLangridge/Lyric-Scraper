Lady Writer on the tv
Talk about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectations left to come up to yeah

Lady writer on the tv
Yeah, she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

Lady writer on the tv
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You talked to me when you felt like it

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus you mother was a jazz singer

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

Lady writer on the tv
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the

Lady writer on the tv
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me
And the lady writer on the tv
Lady writer on the tv
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me
And the lady writer on the tv
