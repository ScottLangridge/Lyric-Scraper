Oh well the sun go down
Celebration in the town tonight
All day long
They been slaughtering upon a stone
Share out the meat
Yeah, you really liked to eat
Come on woman, come follow me home
Well, the priest he cries
Virgins ascending to the skies tonight
All day long
I have passed my time alone
When the church bells rung
I stayed out on the tower
In a dying sun
Come on woman, come follow me home
Well I don't need no priest
But I love all of the people
Yes I share the feast
So drink up my wine
Yes and the song in my bones
I know the way
I can see by the moonlight
Clear as the day
Now come on woman, come follow me home
