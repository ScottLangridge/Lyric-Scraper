Beryl was on another level
When she got a Booker medal
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave

Beryl, every time theyd overlook her
When they gave her a Booker
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave

Its all too late now
Its all too late now
Its too late, you dabblers, its all too late
Its too late, you dabblers, its all too late

Beryl, the tobacco overtook her
When they gave her a Booker
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave

Its all too late now
Its all too late now
Its too late, you dabblers, its all too late
Its too late, you dabblers, its all too late

Beryl was on another level
When she got a Booker medal
She was dead in her grave
After all she gave
After all she gave
After all she gave
After all she gave
