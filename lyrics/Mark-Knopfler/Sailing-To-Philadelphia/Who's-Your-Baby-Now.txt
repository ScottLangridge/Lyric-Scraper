The rock your stood upon
Is broken up and gone
Hey baby, who's your baby now

On the slipway of your dream
Stands someone else's scheme
Hey baby, who's your baby now

Your baby now, baby now
Your baby now, your baby now

The ancient trade you ply
Ain't enough to get you by
Hey baby, who's your baby now
The yard is locked and closed
The old guard has been deposed
Hey baby, who's your baby now

Your baby now, baby now
Your baby now, your baby now

You always had to be the kind
To have to say what's on your mind
And hey, you really showed 'em how
You used to laugh about
How you used to dish it out
But hey, who's laughing now

Cause the rock you stood upon
Is broken up and gone
Hey baby, who's your baby now
Yeh the rock you stood upon
Is broken up and gone
Hey baby, who's your baby now
