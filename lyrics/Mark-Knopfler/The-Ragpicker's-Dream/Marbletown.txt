Roll out here mister
If you need a little rest
Lay me down in Marbletown
A bone yard is the best

There was a bad bull on the railroad
Tried to pull me off this train
Lay me down in Marbletown
'Til the coast is clear again

I can hear them a-hollerin'
'We got a man down here
We got a man down'

I'm gonna flip me a cannonball
That won't stop for anyone
Lay me down in Marbletown
Wait 'til morning comes

I'm gonna roll out here in the tombstones
Wait here on my train
Lay me down in Marbletown
I hope that it don't rain

And I can still hear them hollerin'
'We got a man down here
We got a man down'

Roll out here mister
If you need a little rest
Lay me down in Marbletown
A bone yard is the best
