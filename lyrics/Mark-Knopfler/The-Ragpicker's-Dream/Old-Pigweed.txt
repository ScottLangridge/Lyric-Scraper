Everything was in there
That you'd want to see
Corned beef and onions
And true love
Turnips and tinned tomatoes
Parsnips and A few potatoes
A couple extra blessings
From above

Now this here mingle-Mangle
Was my best one yet
A big old bad goulash
Worth waiting for
And I'm just about to dip my can
Taste some brotherhood of man
When I get A feeling
That there's A flaw

Who put old pigweed
In the mulligan
Was it you
Who put old pigweed
In the mulligan stew
I close my eyes
For just A minute
What do you do
Who put old pigweed
In the mulligan stew

You won't find self-Improvement or philosophy
In A dumpster sitting by
The kitchen door
There's plenty leek and humble pie
Ain't too much ham on rye
Sometimes I wonder
What I'm looking for

But A spoonful of forgiveness
Goes A long, long way
And we all should do our best
To get along
Add A pinch of kindness crumbling
To your loving dumpling
Okra for thickening
When something's wrong

But who put old pigweed
In the mulligan
Was it you
Who put old pigweed
In the mulligan stew
I close my eyes
For just A minute
What do you do
Who put old pigweed
In the mulligan stew
