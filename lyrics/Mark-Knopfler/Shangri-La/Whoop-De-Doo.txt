If i'm over the moon
It's because i'm over you
A day at a time
And i'm tickety-boo
I don't carry on
The way i used to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo

If i'm doing great
It's because when i get home
I don't go straight
To my answerphone
And the tears don't come
The way they used to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo

So many little things
Are so much better now
They were only the little things
Anyhow

If i'm over the moon
It's because that's what i am
Funny that once
I used to give a damn
And i'd do anything
In the whole wide world for you
Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo

Anything
Anything you'd want me to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo
