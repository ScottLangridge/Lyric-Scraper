Shangri-La

Its the end of a perfect day for all the surfer boys and girls
The suns dropping down in the bay and falling off the world
There's a diamond in the sky, our evening stone in our shangri-la

Get that fire burning strong right here and right now
Its here and then it's gone, there's no secret anyhow.
We may never love again to the music of guitars in our shangrila

Tonight your beauty burns into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we got, right here where we are in our shangrila.

Tonight your beauty burns into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we got, right here where we are in our shangrila.
In our shangrila
In our shangrila
