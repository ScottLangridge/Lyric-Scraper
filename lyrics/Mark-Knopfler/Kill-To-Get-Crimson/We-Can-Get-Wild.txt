We're old enough for leaving home,
The old joanna and the old trombone,
It's all going on,
I'm growing my sideboards long,
Hey you and me
Can be who we want to be.

Listen now right here,
It's going to be a beautiful year.

Calling it a teenage scene
And I have a dream,
Don't know if I'll be a star
I'm going to play guitar
I've seen this rocking cat
I want to be just like that.

Listen now right here
It's going to be a beautiful year

Hey look at you baby,
Tell your daddy your no child
Look at you baby
We can get wild.

Oh yeah

We'll be on our own
Billy Fury on the gramophone
Take you to the pictures and a dance
In my drainpipe pants
Check the mirror and the old DA
And "You can play in a day"

Listen now right here
It's going to be a beautiful year

Hey look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Hey look at you baby
We can get wild

Hey look at you baby
Tell your daddy you're no child
Hey look at you baby
We can get wild
We can get wild
Get wild
Get wild
