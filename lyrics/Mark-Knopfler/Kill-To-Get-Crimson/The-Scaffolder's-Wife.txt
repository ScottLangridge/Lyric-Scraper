The scaffolder's wife
Driving out of the yard
With a face that's as hard
As a scaffolder's bar -
When she goes into town
She might take the top down
On the car.

The quick little steps
In the stiletto boots
And the hair with the roots.
She comes in as a rule
To get the nails done
And the tan for the sun
When the kids are in school.

Don't begrudge her the Merc
It's been nothing but work
And a hard life.
Losing her looks
Over company books
- the scaffolder's wife.

In the wicked old days
When they went it alone
Kept the company going
On a wing and a prayer.
They don't pay that they owe
When they have the cash flow
- they don't care

Don't begrudge her the Merc
It's been nothing but work
And a hard life.
Losing her looks
Over company books
- the scaffolder's wife.
