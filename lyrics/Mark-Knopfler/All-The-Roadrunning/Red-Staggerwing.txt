If I was staggerwing plane
A staggerwingpainted red
I'd fly over to your house, baby
Buzz you in your bed
If I was a taperwing
A taperwing painted blue
I'd be barrell-rolling over you
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now

If I was a maserati
A red 300s
I'd ride around to your house, baby
Give you a driving test
If I was a mustang racer
White with a stripe of blue
You could ride me, baby
Whenever you wanted to
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now

If I was a fender guitar
A fender painted red
You could play me, darlin'
Until your fingers bled
If I was one of them gibsons
Like a '58 or '9
You could plug me in
And play me anytime
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now

If I was a motorcycle
A vincent red rapide
I'd ride around to your house, baby
Get you up to speed
If I was short track racer
I'd be an indian
You could ride me around
And ride me round again
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now
You're gonna need a rider anyhow
Let me be your rider now
