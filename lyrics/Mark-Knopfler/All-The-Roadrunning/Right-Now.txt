Miles between us here we are
Sat by side a stranded car
Right now, baby right now
And it's too dark to see
Anyhow so where are we
Right now, baby, right now
You could say we've both come down
To a place called lonesome town
When did you loose a hold on me
Anyhow and where are we
Right now, oh, baby right now

We stood up and said 'i do'
Vowed to see each other through
Right now, baby right now
I'm looking down this road tonight
And I don't see a light
Right now, baby right now
If we're so clever tell me how
Were waiting for the wrecker now
Let's forget what used to be
Anyhow and where are we
Right now, oh baby right now
