This is us down at the Mardi Gras
This is us In your Daddy's Car
You and the missing link
Yeah, I'd had a little too much to drink, now
Too long in the sun
Having too much fun
You and me and our memories
This is us

Rocking at the barbecue
Yeah, when we said I do
Hand jiving on the Ballroom floor
You in that wedding coat you wore
And you in that amazing dress
I was stoned on love I guess
You and me we were meant to be
This is us

This is us on our Honeymoon
In our hotel room
Sitting by the wishing well
Checking out of the love motel
Making plans for the sunshine state
Waiting at the terminal gate
You and me making history
This is us

And our baby boy
With our pride and joy
You at the Sunday Game
Standing next to What's hisname?
On our Anniversary
With the family
You and me and our memories
This is us
