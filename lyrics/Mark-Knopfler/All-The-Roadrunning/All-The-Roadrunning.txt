A million miles our vagabond wheels
Clocked up beneath the clouds
They're counting down to show time
When we do it for real with the crowds
Air miles are owing but they don't come for free
And they don't give you any for pain
But if it's all for nothing
All the road running has been in vain

The rim shots come down like cannon fire
And thunder off the wall
There's a man in every corner
And each one is giving his all
But this is my piper, this is my drum
So you never will hear me complain
And if it's all for nothing
All the road running has been in vain

All the road running
All the road running

Well if you're inclined to go up on the wall
It can only be fast and high
And those who don't like the danger soon
Find something different to try
And when there is only a ring in your ears
And an echo down memory lane
Then if it's all for nothing
All the road running has been in vain

All the road running
All the road running

The show's packing up, I sit and I watch
The carnival leaving town
There's no pretending that I'm not a fool
For riding around and around
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death
You showed me one time on the plane
But if it's all for nothing
All the road running, it's been in vain

I've a million miles of vagabond sky
Clocked up above the clouds
And I'm still your man for the roaming
For as long as there's roaming allowed
There'll be a rider and there'll be a wall
As long as the dream remains
And if it's all for nothing
All the road running it's been in vain

All the road running
All the road running
