How could I fall for someone so superficial
Funny how the things that you can never
Have
Needle you more
Tired of standing in the rain
Praying for sunshine again
I remember your eyes
Wish I could see through them
How could I fall
If I could
Our love was like the wind
We blew it away
Tired of dealing with your games
Praying i'll never need you again
I remember your eyes
Wish I could see through them
We could have loved so much
Why didn't we try make it right
Would it have been enough
If I could
I remember your eyes
Wish I could see through them
How could I fall
If I could
