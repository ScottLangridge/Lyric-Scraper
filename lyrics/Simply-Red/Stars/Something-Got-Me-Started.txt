Something got me started
You know that I will love you
Lately since we parted
I truely know that I need you
I'd give it all up for you
(yes I would)
Totally broken hearted
Guilty of what I did to you
Lately since we parted
I truely know that I need you
I'd give it all up for you
(yes I would)
You've got to help me, help me, help me
