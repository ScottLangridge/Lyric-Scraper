I walk on stone, it leads me home
We don't have streets, just pure concrete
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old red, I don't wanna be alone

I go whiter in the face, my feet begin to shake
I go upstairs to that heavenly place
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old red, I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus:]
Sad old red, sat at home
Sad old red, living on his own
Sad old red, sat at home
Sad old red, let me take you home

It's a cubic room, two holes peep through
Shadows on the wall of trees so tall
I think of her again, the joy she used to bring
Lay there in bed, two words she said
She said "oh red" [repeat]

Sad old red, that's what I am
All the time, every night
Sad old red
