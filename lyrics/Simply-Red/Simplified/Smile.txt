You make me smile glowing shine
you make me glad to be alive
with love that's easy to survive

the girl that i lost when i was blew
has confirmed my heart grows stronger
when there's you
cause you make me smile
you make me smile

true love won't find a better way
fake love as planets get away
new love won't find a better place to stay
the moment that i loved you always knew
my heart loves longer and stronger when there's you
cause you make me smile
you make me smile

the color of my blood is truly justified
that was me it was me I never lied
my blood flows trough you
and my heart goes trough you when you cried

it's no good to plot i've never wondered why
who'd to be who'd to be i'd never tried
it's enough to know you
and to love you baby is my pride

loving you forever is a must
and for now and my love will never be denied

cause you make me smile
you make me smile
you make me smile
you make me smile
you make me smile
