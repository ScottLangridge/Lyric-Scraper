(sunshine in my soul)
(sunshine in my soul)

My lost weekend
Been more now than a year
Oh I hoped not
'cause since you put me down
My world merely spins around
Did you play me for your fool?
Oh honey, I know you didn't mean to

'cause you tremble with a problem
You carry the weight of pain from the past

The sunshine in my soul is here to tell you
That pain doesn't have to last
The love that's in my heart is here to pray
That pain will go away
Feel it honey
Blowin' away

My lost weekend
More now than a year
Oh and it goes on
'cause since you let me down
My world merely spins around
Did you play me for your fool
Oh honey I know you didn't mean to

'cause you're pent up with a problem
You carry the weight of pain from the past

The sunshine in my soul is here to tell you
That pain doesn't have to last
The love that's in my heart is here to say
That pain will go away

The sunshine in my soul is here to tell you
That pain doesn't have to last no, no
The love that's in my heart is here to pray
That pain will go away

Watch that pain go away

Feel it honey
Blowin' away

My lost weekend
