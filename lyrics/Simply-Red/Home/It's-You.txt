Loving you just goes on
On and on, on and on
And on

Growing with you
Is pleasure for two
Raising my spirits
Hoping for you
And I do

And being with you
I see a side of my life
A chance to grow
In a way that I never knew
'cause baby it's you
Honey, it's you

Find a movie where there's no one
On and on, just having fun
On our own

22 different shows on
Don't care which one
Just as long as we're having fun
On and on and on

'cause being with you
I see a change in my life
A chance to grow
In a way that I never knew

'cause baby it's you
You you you, you you you, it's you
Honey it's you
Baby it's you
You you you, you you you, you you you
Honey it's you
