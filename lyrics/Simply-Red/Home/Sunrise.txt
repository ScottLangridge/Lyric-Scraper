Yeah...

As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
The light behind your face sends me new vibes
{Sunrise}
We sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be
Mine {Sunrise}

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
Can we meet at this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could've been me

You're mine forever
Forever... Ever...

Wonder if true life would have come home to you
And the love you want forever will make it true to you
We sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be
Mine {You'll be mine}

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
Can we meet at this moment in time
Love's indescribable
It should be me, it could've been me

You're mine forever

Easy ready, willing overtime
Where does it stop, where do you dare need to draw the
Line
You took my body, now you want my soul
Don't even think about it, say no go, yeah

{Sunrise}

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
Can we meet at this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could've been me

You're mine forever
{Sunrise}

At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could've been me

You're mine forever
Forever... Ever...

{Sunrise}
