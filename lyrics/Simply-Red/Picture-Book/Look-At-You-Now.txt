Right from the start you tried to hurt me
But look at you now, behaving like a fool
A long time ago you treated me so mean but

[Chorus:]
Look at you now
Look at you now

You threw me away like litter in the gutter
I had to pick myself up and find something better

[Chorus:]
Look at you now
Look at you now

I looked so hard, I'm looking hard now
Looking at your head

Don't talk about birthdays, that don't mean a thing to me
Don't throw it in my face, it's too sweet to sting

[Chorus:]
Look at you now
Look at you now

I kept on looking hard [repeat]
Looking at your head. Head!!!
