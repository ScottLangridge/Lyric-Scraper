Why don't you look at the price I'm paying?
Walk in, take a look inside,
I've moved back the tables and chairs to the wall.
The valuable things I've had to hide.
Chorus:
Open up the red box.
Come on, open it up.
Open up the red box.
Come on, open it up.
Peer in, looking for that crasher again.
You ruined Terry's party last night.
An overweight greasy little man with a mouth
That opens more than now and again.
[Chorus:]
Something good must have happened to you.
If you would let it happen to you,
If you could let it happen to you,
Something good would have happened.
Lopez, I hate you for the state you're in.
Lopez, your hair, it washes out, it washes in.
You ropey little fat boy, Lopez.
Come on get lost.
[Chorus:]
Something good must have happened to you.
If you would let it happen to you,
If you could let it happen to you,
Something good would have happened.
I'm out of my head.
