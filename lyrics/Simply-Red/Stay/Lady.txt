Your indulgence of your freedom ignores me
Your freedom to express your confusion shames all of us
As if being a lady will make it easier
By being a lady it will make love life clearer

I hope that you get what you think you want some day baby
And I pray that you get the approval you're craving
This beautiful lady can overtake all of us
Funny this kind of lady seems to make our lives clearer

[Chorus:]
I could turn on a leaf and let you burn
Beg you for relief when it's my turn
Help me to help you help me learn
Ah lady! You make life breathe easier
But don't blame me if your life sheds a tear

The feverish time we spend alone it soothes me
But too many days spent apart alone they just confuse me
Part of being a lady you love it when I miss you more
And without pontificating it's you I'm adorin'

[Chorus:]

Ah Lady! Oh Lady!
Crazy! Ooh Lady!
Ah baby! Ooh you make me crazy!
