They don't know
They don't know

Driving by two lovers
Kissing and walking, livin' out a dream
Mm hoping they will make it
Beauty out of sync in a crowded city scene

They don't know

Driving by two lovers
Hoping to make love's fantasy forever
Hmm I feel so good about them
Will fate force it's hand, could it end it too soon?
I see, together they will learn so much
Have you?
Will you?

Don't let anyone tell you not to dream
Don't let anyone tell you what you think you must think
Mm and if you've never loved my friend
You may not know
That broken hearts don't play the game
They don't play the game

Riding by two lovers
Needing her love again and many times forever
Hmm hope they're gonna make it
Do you want to spend the rest of life on your own?
Cause I see, together they will love so much
Have you?
Will you?

Don't let anyone tell you not to dream
Don't let anyone tell you not to think
Don't let anyone tell you what you think you must think
Mm and if you've never loved my friend
You may not know
That broken hearts don't play the game
They don't play the game

They don't know

Together they will learn so much
Have you?
Mm, they don't know how, oh they don't

Hope you learn how
They don't know [rpt]
