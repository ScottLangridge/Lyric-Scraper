This land is real real as the next man
This land is there for all to see
You're standing there so cold and calm
You stand so close to me

And you out there can keep away
There's nothing owed to you
All I want's to lose myself and stay so close to you

The river is cruel it's pipes are sprayed with long forgotten names
Big boys now with kids whose lives will never feel the same
If you out there don't get what I say there's nothing owed to you
To feel that way is born inside no matter what you do

I wonder how my fortune fell
When everything began to melt
The case I had for wasting that
That never came
I want to walk away again
Away again
Away again
There to wonder how those things will never be
Searching for that grand illusion fools have called the key
If you don't care just keep away how can I give hope to you
Nearer now are both our futures me our hearts and you

And yet all I want is to lose myself and stay so close to you
All I want is to stay so close to you
