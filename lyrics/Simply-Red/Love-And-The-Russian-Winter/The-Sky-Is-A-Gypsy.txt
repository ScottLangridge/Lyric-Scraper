The first time was the best time
The language you use
You gotta be careful what you will choose

And the first high was the best high
You're made of flesh and blood
Yet it makes you feel like wood
Oh the first time was the best time

The first line was the best line
It's hard to learn to beware
Spending thousands of pounds in a year
And worthwhile is it worthwhile
Ever wondered why you need more and more
To reach that sky
Oh the first time was the worst time

And the sky is a gypsy
Oh will I die with her with me

Oh the best time is the worst crime
Oh the first time oh may be the worst time
Oh worthwhile is it really worthwhile

When the sky is a gypsy
Oh will I die with her with me

And the sky is a gypsy
Will I die with her with me

Oh no no no no
The first time
Maybe the worst time
Oh no

Will I die with her with me
