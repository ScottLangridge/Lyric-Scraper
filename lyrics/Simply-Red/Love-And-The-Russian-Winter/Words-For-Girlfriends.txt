Do I feel jealousy when you're free without me
Maybe
Do I feel that my love will stay with you forever
Hopefully
In memoriam of my lovers will you sleep with me forever
Oh most certainly I never did doubt you

You surround yourself with trinkets like they're meaningful possessions
Baby
Like some squirrel in the garden with expensive permutations
Save me
They'll outlive you in the end will be your final realisation
Oh most certainly I never did doubt you

Words for girlfriends parading as songs
To be living with songs yet without you
Words for girlfriends parading as songs
'though I never ever really did doubt you no

As we search our lives forever for perfection in relations
Ladies
I can dream of love and scheme of love with all it's complications
Shakily
Ideals are fine for beauty but for love they fool relations
Oh most certainly I never did doubt you

Words for girlfriends parading as songs
To be living with you yet without you
Words for girlfriends parading as songs
'though I never ever really did doubt you
No I never ever really did doubt you

As we search our lives forever for perfection in relations
Ladies
I can dream of love and scheme of love with all it's complications

They're just words only words
