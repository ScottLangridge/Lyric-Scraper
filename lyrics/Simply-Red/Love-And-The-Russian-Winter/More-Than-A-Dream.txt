For those who are in love
I'm with you babies
How can it be that we feel this way
For those who are a bluff
I fear you ladies how can you treat little me this way

It's a drug that brings you pleasure and pain
It's a love that leaves you crying in the rain

Yeah I'm your lover oh I'm your lover
A ring a ling ting a ling lover
A sing a ling ting a ling lover

How can it be when you're with me baby
You feel the same way as me
I hope you're not a bluff 'cos I need you baby
Do you feel the same way as me

There's an invisible contact between us
A hope and a dream that the words the poets
Have been writing are real

More than a dream
More than just a sex machine
But a lover
