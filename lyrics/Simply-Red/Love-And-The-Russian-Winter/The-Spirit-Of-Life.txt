Are you the best? Or the equal of every man on this earth?
I introspect. I can have anything that I could want
Yet I need for nothing......... Oh nothing

Cause the spirit of life is within you
Breathing with ease through the whole of you
And deeper inside is within you, searching until we find a way
To jump out now, jumping around now
Cause sooner or later we'll be gone

What will be left is the benefit of all we've learnt before,
And what's the test? It's the dignity of every man.
You will need for nothing, oh nothing
You will need for nothing, oh nothing
