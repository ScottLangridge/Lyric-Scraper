I've been a fool, talking to myself and no-one else
I play it cool, so cool that no-one ever understands me
Maybe one day someone will come
Now! Now
I didn't do the things I was supposed to do
You didn't move, you used me and I used you too
Maybe one day someone will come
Maybe one day someone will come
Why it's killing you, is a reason for yourself and no-one else
I couldn't move, you used it and it used you too
Maybe one day someone will come
Maybe one day someone will come
