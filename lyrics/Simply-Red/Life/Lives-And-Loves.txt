Lives and loves, don't tell me about it
To respond to something permanent, you've got to be strong
Mmm... Lives and loves
Only you know in your heart how the pain felt
How the love made you melt, me and you love
We have a way that seems to brighten up the day
We have our problems
Is the whole world asking is it worth it?
All the lovers in the world should they go on?
After all, they say you only live once
Lives and loves, only you know your heart
How the pain felt, how the love made you melt
Me and you love
That seems to brighten up the day
We have our problems
Is the whole world asking is it worth it?
All the lovers in the world should they go on?
On and on and on
Ooohhh, lives and loves, don't tell me about it
Someone always gets hurt in it, you've got to be strong
Hey... Lives and loves
Only we know in our hearts how the pain felt
Oh your love made me melt, me and you love
We had a way to brighten up the day
We had our problems
Is the whole world asking is it worth it?
All the lovers in the world should they go on?
After all, they say you only live once
