It's lonely out on the range
That open space they call country
I wanted you, I couldn't have you
Your pills left you kind of deranged
Hopelessly caged like some monkey
I wanted you, I couldn't have you
Still into my heart you came
Here's a message from this lonely boy
Who will never feel the same
I will never feel the same
I read you while holding the page
You're open at crazy and funky
I needed you, but you weren't there
Happiness can give you the blues
Especially when it ends
I'm slowling down, can't turn you round
Into my heart you came
Here's a message from this lonely boy
Who will never feel the same
I will never feel the same
