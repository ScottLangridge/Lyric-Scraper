I was listening to this conversation
Noticing my daydream stimulated me more
I was crumbling with anticipation
You'd better send me home before I tumble down to the floor
You're so beatiful but oh so boring
I'm wondering what I'm doing here
So beatiful but oh so boring, I'm wondering
If anyone out there really cares
About the curlers in your hair
My little golden baby, where have all your birds flown now ?
Something's glistening in my imagination
Motorvatin' something close to breaking the law
Wait a mo' before you take me down to the station
I've never known a one who'd make me suicidal before
She was so beatiful but oh so boring
I'm wondering what I'm doing here
So beatiful but oh so boring, I'm wondering
If anyone out there really cares
About the curlers in your hair
My little golden baby, where have all your birds flown now ?
