Where do want to go?
Are you sure of the road that you're on?
Who do you want to be?
All I know is the world deserves to be free
Let's pretend we're staring from the moon
Love is not only for the human
Look at the world you know
Do you believe it will go on?
Where do you want to go?
The things we take will only last for so long
In the end you know it's up to you
Love is not only for the human
Oh man, we are so many people
Living different lives under turbulent times
Oh man, we don't know good from evil
Looking through our eyes is the burden of our lives
Say can we tell for sure
The North and South will keep their snow on?
Say can the Earth endure
Do you really believe we can go on?
In the end you know it's up to you
Love is not only for the human
Oh man, we are so many people
Living different lives under turbulent times
Oh man, we don't know good from evil
Looking through our eyes is the burden of our lives
In the end God is the Universe
And the Universe is you
