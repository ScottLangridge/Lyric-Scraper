Jose jones
Told me alone
His story
He got friends
Like paco picopiedra
La muneca
He receives on his set
Crack crack crackity jones

Please forgive me
Jose jones
You need these walls
For your own
I'm moving out of this hospedaje
I'm afraid you'll cut me boy

Thirty miles by
Hundred miles by
Stinking island
Por goofiar
En crushing automovil
Chasing voices
He receives in his head
Crack crack crackity jones
