Hope everything is alright hope everything is alright
What's that floating in the water
Oh neptune's only daughter
I believe
In mr. grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like doolittle
I believe
In mr. grieves
Do you have another opinion
Do you have another opinion
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Got bombed got frozen
Got finally off to a finally dozing
I believe
In mr. grieves
Do you have another opinion
Opinion
Do you have another opinion
Do you have another opinion
You can cry you can mope
But can you swing from a good rope
Oh i believe
In mr. grieves
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
