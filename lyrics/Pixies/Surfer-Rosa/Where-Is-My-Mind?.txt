With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
You try this trick and spin it, yeah
But your head will collapse and there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself

Chours-
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Way out in the water
See it swimming

I was swimming in the Carribean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
But he told me he swears he tried to talk to me

Chours

With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse and there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself

Chours

With your feet in the air and your feet on the ground
Try this tring and spin it, yeah
