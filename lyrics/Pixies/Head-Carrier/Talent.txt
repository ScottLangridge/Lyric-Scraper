[Verse 1]
I met this real cool dude today
Looking like Jack Palance
He said "I wanna get through to you
And help you find your talent"

He said that if I had a certain style
The stuff would start to happen
He said that soon he was going away
Cause he's a major talent
[Chorus]
Talent
Fighting on the east side
Talent
Taking on the west side
Talent
Fucking up the north side
He's a major talent

[Chorus]
Talent
Fighting on the east side
Talent
Taking on the west side
Talent
Fucking up the north side
He's a major talent

I don't know

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
I said that he was getting through to me
And I would take his challenge
I maybe soon I'll be going away
Cause I have certain talents

[Chorus]
Talent
Fighting on the east side
Talent
Taking on the west side
Talent
Fucking up the north side
I'm a major talent

Talent
Finding on the east side
Talent
Taking on the west side
Talent
Fucking up the north side

[Outro]
I met this dude today
Down in the sewers of Paris
Was hiding from the sun
What a waste of talent
