Hey, Rusty, come hold Luthers hand
Its deja-vu, its not like I planned
Looks like Im going where Ive already been

Im going down the drain, again

Is this really worth it?
I got a prison cough
A three-headed monster cut Dennys head right off
You cant be too chill
You cant be too zen

Im going down the drain, again
Im going down the drain, again 
Im going down the drain, again 

Up the hill to have him killed and he still hadnt died 
He talked a while and walked six mile down to riverside
