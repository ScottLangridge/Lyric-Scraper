[Verse 1: Frank Black]
The drum sticks were his treasure trove
Found in the ashes of the coconut grove

[Pre-Chorus 1: Frank Black, backed by Paz Lenchantin]
Hey man, can you give me something
Hey man, did you give me something
Hey man, nothing comes from nothing
Hey man, something came from somewhere
[Chorus: Frank Black, backed by Paz Lenchantin]
Hey man, it's a tenement song
Just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

[Interlude: Paz Lenchantin]
Tenement song
Tenement song

[Verse 2: Frank Black, backed by Paz Lenchantin]
Tall model and one more smoke
Tenement Song
She lived through the fire but the kennel got broke
Tenement Song

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Black, backed by Paz Lenchantin]
Hey man, can you give me something
Hey man, did you give me something

[Chorus: Frank Black, backed by Paz Lenchantin]
Hey man, it's a tenement song
Just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

[Solo]

[Chorus: Frank Black, backed by Paz Lenchantin]
Hey man it's a tenement song
Just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

[Outro: Paz Lenchantin]
On and on and on
