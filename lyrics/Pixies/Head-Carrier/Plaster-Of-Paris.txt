[Verse]
You look like a praying mantis
You could say that the bug is man

[Chorus]
Big joke or a small disaster
Last chance before they give it the plaster

[Verse]
Paint my picture and Ill paint you
Youre not like the others, you aint

[Chorus]
Running down the hill I thought I passed her
Last chance before they give it the plaster

[Verse]
I cant dance but I dont wanna bore ya
Last line from the cephalaphore

[Chorus]
Ill be the son of a son of a son of a bastard
Last chance before they give it the plaster

[Chorus]
Big joke or a small disaster
Last chance before they give it the plaster
