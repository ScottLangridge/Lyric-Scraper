He did his little dance
There up in the north of Spain
Danced all the way to France
Just to try and bring her rain

Thats the way of this man

He rolled away the stone
With a plastic crucifix
Cause hed rather get his kicks
Than be here all alone

Thats the way of this man

Hes not much of a bel esprit
She cant seem to understand him
A bit more like a chimpanzee

She thinks he has no soul
Cause he never learned to crawl

Thats the way of this man

And he can only sing
Of his incipient love

Thats the way of this man

Hes not much of a bel esprit
She cant seem to understand him
A bit more like a chimpanzee

Thats the way of this man 
Thats the way of this man 

Thats the way of this man 
Thats the way of this man
