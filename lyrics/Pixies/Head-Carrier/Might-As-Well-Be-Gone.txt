[Verse 1]
Youre the chosen one
But I could use a change
Even golden suns
Find the end of their reign

[Chorus]
You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
Thats my speech, thats my song

[Verse 2]
In the street tonight
But the bars are all closed
We could meet tonight
But youre only a ghost

[Chorus]
You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
Yeah you might as well be gone
Thats my speech thats my song

[Break]

[Chorus]
You might as well be gone (gone gone)
You might as well be gone (gone gone)
You might as well be gone (gone gone)
Yeah you might as well be gone (gone gone)
Thats my speech thats my song
