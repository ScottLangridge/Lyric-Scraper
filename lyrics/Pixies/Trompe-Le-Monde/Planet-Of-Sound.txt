One fine day in my odd past
I picked me up a transmission
I turned the fission ignition
Went looking for the broadcaster
And when I first touched some ground
They simply told me leave
Was kind of hard to believe
'cause there was not one around
This ain't the planet sound
This ain't the planet sound
This ain't the planet sound
This ain't the planet sound
I had a talented wine
That land o' classical gas
And on the planet of glass
They sent me skipping through time
Igot to somewhere renowned
For it's canals and color of red
And lots of guys who shook their heads
Rhythmically to resound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't no rock and roll town
This ain't no fuckin' around
This ain't no planet of sound
I met a guy in a rover
He said it's one more over
Its just there where your bound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound.
