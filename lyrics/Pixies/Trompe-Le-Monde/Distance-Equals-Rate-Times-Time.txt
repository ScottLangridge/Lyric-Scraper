Distance equals rate times time

I had me a vision
There wasn't any television
From looking into the sun
I'm looking into the sun
We got to think quick
Says the blind st. Nick hey
From looking into the sun
Looking into the sun
We got to get some beer
We got no atmosphere
From looking into the sun
Looking into the sun
I had me a vision
There wasn't any television
From looking into the sun.
