Speed leaving without
Warning
I need some place to sleep tonight
Blowing in the rocking of the pine
Speed leaving without warning
The sunlight is going
Into the mountain
I will crawl
Into the mountain
Sun shines in the rusty morning
Skyline of the olympus mons
I think about it sometimes
Sun shines in the rusty morning
Once I had a good fly
Into the mountain
I will fall.
