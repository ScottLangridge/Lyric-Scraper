In the sleepy west ofthe woody east
Is a valley full, full o' pioneer
We're not just kids, to say the least
We got ideas to us that's dear
Like capitalist, like communist
Like lots of things you've heard about
And redneckers they get us pissed
And stupid stuff it makes us shout
Oh dance with me oh don't be shy
Oh kissme cunt and kiss me cock
Oh kiss the world oh kiss the sky
Oh kiss my ass oh let it rock
Of the april birds and the may bee
Oh baby
University
Of massachusetts, please
And here's the last five
It's educational
It's educational
It's educational
It's educational
It's educational.
