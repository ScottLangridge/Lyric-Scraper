Why do cupids and angels
Continually haunt her dreams
Like memories of another life
Is painted on her shirt in capital
Out on the free free way
There's only she an the they
Represented by the lights
We went to the store and bought something great
Which samples this song from washington state
Go
Go little record go
It is named by
Some guy named joe
And the words
Are the letters of the words
Said
Electrically played
For outer space and those of they who paid
This song is twice ocurred
And now it's time to go
Away on holiday.
