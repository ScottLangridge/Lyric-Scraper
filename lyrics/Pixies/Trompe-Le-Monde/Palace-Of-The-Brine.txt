In a place they say is dead
In the lake that's like an ocean
I count about a billion head
All the time
There's a motion
Palace of the brine
I saw the cloning
Of the famous family
I heard the droning
In the shrine
Of the sea-monkey
Palace of the brine
Beneath reflections in the fountain
The starry sky and utah mountains
They are swimming happily
Can't you see
A life that's so sublime
Palace of the brine.
