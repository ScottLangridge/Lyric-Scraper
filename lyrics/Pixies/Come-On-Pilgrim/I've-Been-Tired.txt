One, two, three
She's a real left-winger 'cause she been down south
And held opossums in her arms, she said
"i could tell you stories that could make you cry. what about you? "
I said, "me too. I could tell you a story that would make you cry."
And she sighed, "ahh."

I said, "i want to be a singer like lou reed."
"i like lou reed," she said, sticking her tongue in my ear.
"let's go, let's sit, let's talk, politics goes so good with beer.
"and while we're at it, baby, why don't you tell me one of your
Biggest fears? "
I said, "losing my penis to a whore with disease."
"just kidding," I said. "losing my life to a whore with disease."
She said, "excuse me, please? "
I said, "losing my life to a whore with disease."
She said, "please."
Well, I'm a humble guy with healthy desire
Don't give me no shit because

I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired

I told the tale of a girl but I call her a woman
She's a little bit older than me
Strong legs, strong face, voice like milk, breasts like a cluster of
Grapes
I can't escape her ways she raise me

She make me feel like solomon
Beware your babies even if you have no one
And while we're at it baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest
Fears?
You don't want to sleep after setting my loins on fire
Well, that's okay because

I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired
T-i-r-e-d spells it, spells it, spells it, spells it
