Meet me by the coppice stool
Before the sky takes back its jewels
Bring your life of memories
Before they sink into the seas

Snakes are coming to your town
In tunnels underground
Some traveling overground
A plague for our mistakes
Theyll be right next to you
Snakes up against me, too
Therell be nothing to do 
When the rattle shakes

One more glass and then we're dry
Say some words I'll write them down
Seal the couplets deep inside

Snakes are coming to our town
In tunnels underground
Some traveling overground
A plague for our mistakes
Theyll be right next to you
Snakes up against me, too
Theyll be nothing to do 
When the rattle shakes
