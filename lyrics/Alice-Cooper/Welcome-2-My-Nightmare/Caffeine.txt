I gotta stay awake
I just can't sleep
Because I know inside if I close my eyes
It'll be the death of me

Because I fear the night
When the darkness creeps
That's when the shadows thrive, that's when I must survive
Cuz every night they come for me

I'm shakin' in the ice cold shower
I been here for about a week
But if I leave, I could doze for hours
And that would surely be the end of a coward like me

Caffeine, caffeine
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine, caffeine
(Woo-woo-woo!)

I won't sleep at night
I won't rest my head
Because I realize if I shut my eyes
I'm gonna wake up dead

I'm in a desperate way
I'm very near the end
And all I know's a triple-shot of Joe
Is my only friend

I'm shakin' in the ice cold shower
I been here for about a week
But if I leave, I could doze for hours
And that would surely be the end of a coward like me

Caffeine, caffeine
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine, caffeine
(Woo-woo-woo!
Woo-woo-woo!)

Caffeine, caffeine
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine, caffeine
Caffeine, caffeine
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine, caffeine

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, ahhh...
