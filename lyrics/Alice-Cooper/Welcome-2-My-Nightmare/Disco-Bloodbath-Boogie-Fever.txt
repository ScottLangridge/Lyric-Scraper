Yo, yo, yo, whoah-oh-oh
Yo, yo, yo, whoah-oh-oh

Here you are
In the club
With your bottle
Full of Bud
You've got grill
You got bling
But player, you don't know a thing

Put your hands
In the air
Stick 'em up
Like you don't care
Face the wall
Count to ten
We mow you down
Reload again

Oh no, here we go

Disco who?
Disco what?
Get down on your knees
And keep your trap shut!

Disco this!
Disco that!
When this goes to hell,
Dat's where we're at!

Yo, yo, yo, whoah-oh-oh
Yo, yo, yo, whoah-oh-oh

(Disco bloodbath boogie fever, Disco bloodbath boogie fever)
Disco bloodbath boogie fever
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever, Disco bloodbath boogie fever)
Disco bloodbath boogie fever

Bodies here
Bodies there
Piles of bodies everywhere
On the chairs
On the door
Disco bloodbath on the floor

Hear 'em yell
Hear 'em scream
Just like someone's scary dream
Dig a hole
Push 'em in
Tomorrow they'll be back again

Oh no!
Here we go!

Disco who?
Disco what?
Get down on your knees
And keep your trap shut!

Disco this!
Disco that!
When this goes to hell,
Dat's where we're at!
Where we're at

Yo, yo, yo, whoah-oh-oh
Yo, yo, yo, whoah-oh-oh

(Disco bloodbath boogie fever, Disco bloodbath boogie fever)
Disco bloodbath boogie fever
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever, Disco bloodbath boogie fever)
Disco bloodbath boogie fever
(Fever, fever, fever, fever...)

We've cleaned the house tonight
(We cleaned house tonight)
We did our job, alright
(We did our jobs, alright)
We turned out all the lights, okay.

We were sent to let them know
(Let 'em know)
It was time to let them go
(We really had to go)
Cuz we're the ones who close the show, okay
