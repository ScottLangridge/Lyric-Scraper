Daddy wants to take me for a ride
Daddy likes to drink when daddy drives
He's poundin' on my door
He wants to come inside
Yeah, daddy wants to take me for a ride
That's just the way it is when I'm left alone
Yeah, that's when hell comes home

Mommy says that everything is fine
Mommy hides her bruises all the time
She always makes excuses, but I know that she is lyin'
Mommy says that everything is fine
That's just the way it, he's evil to the bone
Mommy says that everything is fine
Yeah, that's just the way it is when we're left alone
Cuz that's when hell comes home

I hear those footsteps on the stairs
Mom's bleedin' out, oh, maybe she don't care
We live in darkness and despair
I'm just so tired of bein' scared

[Daddy comes home and yells at mommy and Steven]

Daddy's gonna get a big surprise
I'll put one right between his eyes
And with his blood, I'll write his last goodbyes
Yeah, daddy's gonna get a big surprise
That's just the way it is, he'll be deader than a stone
That's just the way it is, he'll leave us both alone
That's just the way it is 
When hell comes home
Home
