Now you're here, so have no fear,
I'm just your friendly guide.
So come along cuz you belong;
You joined us when you died.

From your birth until your final breath,
I'm proud to say you finally entertained yourself to death!

Welcome to the congregation
I hope we meet your expectation
A little tiny pinch of deviation

We understand what you had planned,
Goes by another name,
Where bluebirds sing and church bells ring,
Well, isn't that a shame?

Your application sadly was denied.
But let's be clear, we love you here;
You're on the other side!

Welcome to the congregation
I hope we meet your expectation
We promise it won't stain your reputation

Ah, if you can see over here, The Broken Glass Chamber of the boys from
Wall Street. Let's hear it for the boys! And here in The Eternal Mariachi
Room, above the eve marked Priest and Telemarketers. [?] the fiery pit
Of boiling death, the lawyers, pimps and mimes.

Welcome to the congregation
Welcome to the congregation
Welcome to the congregation
I hope we meet your expectation
So thanks for dropping by here.
We're really gonna try here,
But in the end, you know you're gonna fry...
Fry...
Fry... Here!

Um, excuse me, sir. Is there a bathroom here?
