Chorus:
Cause what baby wants, what baby wants, wants
Baby gets, she gonna gonna, gonna get, get
What baby wants, what baby wants, wants
She gonna gonna, gonna get, get

I got a pretty face,
Yeah, but I've seen it's nothing underneath!
You got my pretty mouth
But you got razor blades instead of teeth!
And now we're too, too, too faithful, yeah
Oh, yeah? Tell me what you gonna do!
I'm gonna drain your veins, and baby you're blind
I've seen worse than you!
I'm not gonna sit back, roll over, play dead
Ain't gonna be your little pet!
Oh really?

Chorus:
Cause what baby wants, what baby wants, wants
Baby gets, she gonna gonna, gonna get, get
What baby wants, what baby wants, wants
She gonna gonna, gonna get, get

Baby tells lies; baby looks you in the eyes
It's her aphrodisiac when she stabs you in the back!
