Baby, I wanna tell you somethin'
Just a word and it's no lie
I got so much feelin' inside of me
Baby, our love will last forever
Through the changes of the heart
Through the lonely nights, whenever we're far apart
Before we say goodbye
All I wanna say is I

I just wanna give you somethin'
To remember me by
Somethin' that lasts forever
Cuz our love is for all time

Baby, I may be gone tomorrow
But I'm here with you tonight
I'll be holdin' you 'til morning light
And baby, I'm gonna watch you wake up
Scattered clothes across the floor
And hear you whisper to me,
Love me again once more before we say goodbye
All I wanna say is I

Just wanna give you somethin'
To remember me by
I won't be gone forever
And our love is for all time
I wanna give you somethin'
To remember me by

Somethin' to remember
Further on down the line
Somethin' to remember me by
Bye-bye
