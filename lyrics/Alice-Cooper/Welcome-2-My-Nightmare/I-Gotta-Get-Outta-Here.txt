Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't wait to wake up in my very own bed
Far away from the madness and my poundin' head
The shiver up my spine and this feelin' of dread

Well, first I finally passed out, then I woke up in pain
Tangled in the wreckage of a runaway train
Was I the last man on Earth or was I just insane?

I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get outta here
I gotta, gotta get outta here
I'm gettin' the message, it's totally clear
Yeah, I really gotta get out of here

Get, get, outta here
Get, get, get outta here, yeah

I danced at the disco where the bodies all fell
Piled up to the sky, what a sulfurous smell
Man, the ghouls on the beach, they were hotter than hell
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I popped the old man; put a hole in his eye
Spent the night with the devil, she was such a bad guy
And if he has her way, I will eternally fry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get outta here
I gotta, gotta get outta here
It's not complicated; yeah, it's pretty damn clear
I really gotta get outta here

Just wanna be myself again
And find my way out of this iniquitous den
I ain't havin' fun and I ain't makin' friends
I don't wanna know how this nightmare ends

I don't know why I'm here, why I've fallen from grace
I can't explain the burns or the scars on my face
Somebody please wake me up and get me out of this place
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I said, I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get outta here
I gotta, gotta get outta here
They say, is it the message?
Plead a new year
Sonny
What part of dead don't you get?

Uh, excuse me?

What part of dead don't you get?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute!
What part of dead don't you get?
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
What part of dead don't you get?
Hey, I signed on for a nightmare!
What part of dead don't you get?
Really? I mean, that's a little twisted, don't you think?
What part of dead don't you get?
I, don't, I, I, hey, whoa!
What part of dead don't you get?
I get it! But, but I don't get it!
What part of dead don't you get?
I'm sinking here! Hello?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
