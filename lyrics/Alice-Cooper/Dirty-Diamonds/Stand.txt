(Alice Cooper, Rick Boston, Bridget Benenate, Xzibit)
Yeah, stand up
What do you believe in
Yeah, stands up
Come on

Just a face in the crowd
Feeling lost, down and out
Can you hear me now

Millions more just like you
Afraid to do what they wanna do
Am I getting through?

Lots of losers hanging round
Only there to bring you down
Get your feet up off the ground
Get up, get up, get up

If you don't stand for something
You will fall for anything
If you don't stand for something
You will fall for anything Get up

Don't you know that you're worth
As much as anyone on earth
You're a megastar

Put your hands in the sky
Let your freaky colors fly
Get 'em way up high

You got style and you got game
So get it out don't be ashamed
Let everybody know your name
Get it on out now what's you name

If you don't stand for something
You will fall for anything
If you don't stand for something
You will fall for anything
Get up

You can stand for peace
You can stand for war
I stand in the square never stood before
I take a stand for my son like Afeni Shakur
I take a stand like I'm 4 double six 64

Stand alone in my struggle
Can't make me stand down
Make 'em crash and burn
Mayday, mayday, mayday down
Get up, stand up
Get your damn hands up
If they're not shackled to your feet, get some handcuffs

We need solutions not propaganda
Let the tape roll
Make the whole world stand up
Hold your position
Don't go backwards
X still grinding
The west keep shining
Don't look too long
You might get blinded
Follow your heart
Your head might just find it
I pray for the strength to handle what my city brings
Better stand for something or you're bound to fall for anything

If you don't stand for something
You will fall for anything
Get up
If you don't stand for something
You will fall for anything

Everybody's got a voice
So it's time to make some noise
