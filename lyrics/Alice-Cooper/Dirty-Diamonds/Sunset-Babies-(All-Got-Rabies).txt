They're running in packs on a Saturday night
They got their own bark and they got their own bite
Waiting in line I can't wait no more, no
Slip right in you get kicked out the back door

I don't know
If it's possible to tame one
I don't know
If she'll follow me home
I don't know
What it is about her

Sunset babies
All got rabies
Sunset babies
All got rabies
I got my shots

They got a sick sense they know why you're here
They can smell the fear through the smoke and the beer
They're a vicious breed and they just don't care
You think you're in but you're going nowhere

I don't know
If it's safe to pet one
I don't know
If she'll go for my throat
I don't know
What it is about them

Sunset babies
All got rabies
Sunset babies
All got rabies
