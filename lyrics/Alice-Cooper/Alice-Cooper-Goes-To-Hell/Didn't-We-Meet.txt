Pardon me
But you see I've seen that face before
I know those eyes
Unearthly wise
I feel it more and more
To look at you
Deja Vu
Chills me to the core
They say that you are the king of this whole damn thing
But that only confused me
They say I don't stand a ghost of a chance with my host
And it frankly amused me
So let's drink a few
Here's looking at you
I swear
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?
Gradually I could see
Things are getting clear
That ancient face
Satanic grace
This sudden rush of fear
They say that you are the king of this whole damn thing
Now they got me believin'
They said I don't stand a ghost of a chance with my host
So I better be leaving
So let's drink a few
Here's looking at you
I swear
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?
Here I am
The door's been slammed
They're gonna roast my hide
Make me bleed
Til I plead
For you to let me die
They say that you are the king of this whole damn thing
Now they got me believin'
They said I don't stand a ghost of a chance with my host
God, I wish I were leaving
So let's drink a few
Here's looking at you
I swear
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?
