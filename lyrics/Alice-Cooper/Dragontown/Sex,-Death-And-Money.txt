Sex, death sex death sex death

When I go to the show all I see on the screen is a stream of pure vulgarity
I wrote down a note, I complained for a day to the House of Representatives
They laughed in my face, they said "Son, you're a one-in-a-million minority"
The name of the game is to titillate the brain, stimulate the immorality

I was so offended as I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty, I was so shocked
Just a little more flesh
Just a little more blood
Little closer to the edge
A little deeper in the mud
I'll never be the same

Sex, death and money, sonny, makes this wicked world go round
Sex, death and money, it's the Gospel here in Dragontown
Sex, death and money, honey, grease the wheels and make them fly
Sex, death and money, sonny, that is why we all are gonna fry

Stuck my nose in the door, ended up on the floor in the middle of an nudie show
She danced on my lap, acoupla hundred dollars later I was up on a morals rap

I was so offended as I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty, I was so shocked
Just a little more flesh
Just a little more blood
Little closer to the edge
A little deeper in the mud
I'll never be the same

Sex, death and money, sonny, grease the wheels and make them fly
Sex, death and money, that is why we all are gonna..
That is why we all are gonna fry 
That is why we all are gonna fry
(Sex, death, sex, death,seax, death)

Sex, death and money, it's the Gospel here in Dragontown
Sex, death and money, sonny, that is why we all are gonna 
Sex, death and money, sonny, that is why we all are gonna fry 
(Sex, death, sex, death, sex, death, sex..)
