Here i go again
Up and down alone
All my friends went home
Years ago
(mmmm mmmm)

All my toys are broken
And so am i inside mum
The carnival has closed
Years ago
(whistle)

(boy)im a little boy
(man)no, im a great big man
(Boy)no, lets be little boys
(Spoken)a little while longer
Maybe an hour
(man)no Steven we have to go back now
(both)isnt that our mum calling
(steven, steven, steven it's time to come home)

I don't want to see you go
I don't even want to be there
I will cover up my eyes
And pray it goes away

You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming

I don't like to hear you cry
You just don't know how deep that cuts me
So I will cover up my eyes
And it will go away

You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming

STEVEN!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
That icy breath that whispers screams of pain!

I don't want to feel you die
But if that's the way that God has planned you
I'll put pennies on your eyes
And it will go away
See?

You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming

Steven....
Is someone calling me? No....
Steven....
I think I hear a voice--- it's outside the door!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
STEVEN!
WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT-DO-YOU-WANT?

STEVEN!
STEVEN!
STEVEN!
I hear my name....

Im down here in the basement
Im so hungry and tired
I must be here sleep walking
Mustn't i?

Getting up from my easy chair
Looking for my wife
Following a trail of crimson spots
That lead into the night

Suddenly I realize
I see it all through real eyes
These crimson spots are
Dripping from my hand
Ahh ooooohhhhhhhhh---

You make me feel like a man.

THE END
