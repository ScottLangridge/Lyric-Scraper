(vincent price speaks)
Leaving lepidoptera... Please, don't touch the display,
Little boy, aha cute! Moving to the next aisle we have
Arachnida, the spiders, our... Finest collection.
This friendly little devil is the heptothilidi,
Unfortunately harmless. Next to him, the nasty licosa
Raptoria, his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of
The skin (laugh). And here, my prize, the Black
Widow. Isn't she lovely?... And so deadly. Her kiss is
Fifteen times as poisonous as that of the rattlesnake.
You see her venom is highly neurotoxic, which is to say
That it attacks the central nervous system causing
Intense pain, profuse sweating, difficulty in
Breathing, loss of consciousness, violent convulsions
And, finally... Death. You know what I think I love the
Most about her is her inborn need to dominate,
Possess. In fact, immediately after the consummation
Of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the
Species she kills and eats him...(laugh) oh, she is
Delicious... And I hope he was! Such power and dignity
... Unhampered by sentiment. If I may put forward a
Slice of personal philosophy, I feel that man has ruled
This world as a stumbling dimented child-king long
Enough! And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black
Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor!

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew if
We don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow

The horror that he brings
The horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings
The Black Widow

Our minds will be his toy
And every girl and boy will learn to be employed by
The Black Widow

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him

He sits upon his throne and picks at all the bones of his
Husbands and his
Wives he's devoured
He stares with a gleam
With a laugh so obscene at the virgins and the children
He's deflowered

Love me
Yes we love me
Love him
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him
Love me
Yes we love him

Our thoughts are hot and crazed
Our brains are webbed in haze
Of mindless senseless daze
The Black Widow

These words he speaks are true
We're all humanary stew
If we don't pledge allegiance to
The Black Widow
