I can't get a girl
Cuz I ain't got a car
I can't get a car
Cuz I ain't got a job
I can't get a job
Cuz I ain't got a car
So I'm looking for a girl with a job and a car
Don't you know where you are

I got a mom but I ain't got a dad
My dad's got a wife but she ain't my mom
Mom's looking for a man to be my dad
But I want my mom and dad to be my real
Mom and dad
Is that so bad
Oh, I think I've been had

Well, I live at the 7-11
Well, I'm tryin' to play this guitar
Well, I'm learning "Stairway to Heaven"
Cuz Heaven's where you are

I can't go to school
Cuz I ain't got a gun
I ain't got a gun
Cuz I ain't got a job
I ain't got a job
Cuz I can't go to school
So I'm looking for a girl with a gun and a job ( and house... with cable)
Don't you know where you are
