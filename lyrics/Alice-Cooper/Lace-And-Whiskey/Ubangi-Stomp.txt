Well, I rocked over Italy and I rocked over Spain.
I rocked in Memphis;
It was all the same
Til I rocked to Africa.
I rolled off the ship.
I seem them natives doin' an odd looking skip.
I parted the weeds
And I looked over the swamp,
And I seen them cats doin' the Ubangi Stomp.

Ubangi Stomp is a rock and roll.
It beats anything that's ever been told.
Ubangi Stomp, Ubangi style;
When it kicks,
It drives a cool cat wild.

Well I looked up the chief;
He invited me in.
He said, "A heap big jam session's 'bout to begin."
I grabbed up a tom and I picked up the beat.
That crazy thing sent
Shivers to my feet.
I rocked and I rolled
And I skipped with a smile.
I did the Ubangi Stomp with a Ubangi style.

Well, we rocked all night and part of the day.
Had a good, rock-in' time
With the chief's daughter Mae.
I'm makin' good time and I'm gettin' in the know
When the captain said, "Son, we've gotta go."
I said, "That's all right.
You go right ahead.
I'm gonna Ubangi Stomp til I roll over dead."

Ubangi Stomp is a rock and roll.
It beats anything that's ever been told.
Ubangi Stomp, Ubangi style;
When it kicks,
It drives a cool cat wild.

Ubangi Stomp, thank you.
