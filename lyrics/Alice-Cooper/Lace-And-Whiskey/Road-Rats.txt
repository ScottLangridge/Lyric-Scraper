We work this band 'cause they make it rock,
But we're the guys that make it roll.
We move the drums and amps and junk.
Road rats:
We're a pack,
And the road's our home.

On the road half my young man's life.
I spend a lot of time;
Ain't got no bread to show for it.

Road rats:
All the cash spent on whites and wine.

We're the men behind the man.
We're the backbone muscle clan.
We do a thousand one night stands.
If the stars can make it,
If the band can shake it,
Well, if those guys can take it,
We can,
Yeah.
