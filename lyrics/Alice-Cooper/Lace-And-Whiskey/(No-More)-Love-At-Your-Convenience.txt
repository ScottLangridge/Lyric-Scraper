Your childish game is over now.
Lost your power over night some how.
Better see it ain't gonna be like it used to be.

No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your command.
No more love at your convenience.
Lots of time late at night, I really needed you.

I'm telling you tonight's the night.
Close your mouth;
Turn off the light.
Pull me babe.
Pull me down closer on you.

No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your command.
No more love at your convenience.
Lots of time late at night, I really needed you.
I really needed you.
I really needed you.

No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your command.
No more love at your convenience.

Quit your tears and dry your eyes.
You know I hate to see you cry.
Don't you see,
Things gotta be what they got to.

No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.
No more love at your convenience.

(Music fades out and Alice says a line that is real fast and hard to
Decipher.)(Any takers?)
