When I was a boy
I thought that someday I would be a man
I'd sit beside the fireplace
Pretending I was in a can
Go inside my room
And put my mind in an ice cream cone
And you can throw me if you wanna
I'm a ball, and I go
Ooh bip bip, ooh bip bip yeah

Now if I don't start cryin'
It's because that I have got no eyes
My heart lies in the fireplace
My dog lies hypnotized
And then there was the time
I wasn't able to find my way
And I'm trapped inside a night
But I'm a day, and I go
Ooh bip bip, ooh bip bip yeah

(Ad lib)

Now when I was a boy
I thought that someday I would be a man
I'd sit beside the fireplace
Pretending I was in a can
Go inside my room
And put my mind in an ice cream cone
Now you can throw me if you want
'Cause I'm a ball, and I go
Ooh bip bip, ooh bip bip yeah

(Ad lib)

Ooh bip bip, ooh bip bip yeah
