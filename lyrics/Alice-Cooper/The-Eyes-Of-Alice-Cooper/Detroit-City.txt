Me and Iggy were giggin' with Ziggy and kickin' with the mc5
Ted and Seger were burnin' with fever
And let the Silver bullets fly
The Kid was in his crib, shady wore a bib
And the posse wasn't even alive
Shock rock choppin' block, songs to make your heart stop
Shovie it in ta overdrive

Playing loud and fast
Make that guitar blast
Playing like today will be your last...

Well I was born there
Gonna die there
With all my long hair
Detroit City
You feel your heart beat
You hit the concrete
Dance the mean street
Detroit City

There's a riot raging downtown
Tryin' to burn the place down
Skies glowin; red and grey
But the Riff kept a Rockin'
The Creem kept a-talkin'
And the streets still smokin' today

Playing loud and fast
Make that guitar blast
Playing like today will be your last...

Well I was born there
Probably die there
With all my long hair
Detroit City
You feel your heart beat
You hit the concrete
Dance the mean streets
Detroit City

Six mile seven mile eight mile nine mile
Ten mile eleven mile Detroit city

Louder
Faster
Louder
Detroit City

Well I was born there
Gonna die there
We don't belong here
Detroit City
You feel your heart beat
Hit the concrete
Dance the mean street
Detroit City

Well I was born there
Probably die there
With all my long hair
Detroit City
You feel your heart beat
You hit the concrete
Dance the mean street
Detroit City
