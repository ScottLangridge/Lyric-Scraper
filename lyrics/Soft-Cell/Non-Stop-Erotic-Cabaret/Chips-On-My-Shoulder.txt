Chips on my shoulder
More as I grow older
Feel I owe a debt
For the things I don't get
I only miss out
Well I was there before
I sit in a corner
Sit on the floor

Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

There's no time for fun time
It's sit and complain time
I'll talk about famine
While cooking my dinner
Don't you feel guilty
Don't you feel pity (No)
While the cat gets fatter
And the starving get thinner

Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

I should have told you
I've chips on my shoulder
I'm making a stand
While I sit on my arse
Fish and chip supper
Whereas those in the gutter
Can't have a good time
Fun's just a farce

Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

Chips on my shoulder
More as I grow older
Feel I owe a debt
For the things I don't get
I only miss out
Well I was there before
I sit in a corner
Sit on the floor

Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Misery, complaints, self pity, injustice
Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

Now sing it

Chips on my shoulder
(I've got) Chips on my shoulder
Etc...
