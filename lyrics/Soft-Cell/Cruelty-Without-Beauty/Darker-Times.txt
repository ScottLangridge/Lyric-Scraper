These darker times

Where do we go from here?

Living for trivial information
It's a hopeless situation


Blinded by lies

False Gods and fake religions

Ulterior motives and bad intentions

Nobody knows what waits round the corner
We gotta keep dancing

Through the years


We gotta keep smiling through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times




These darker times

Why has it come to this

Urban decay and revolution

Suicide is the only solution

Am I being unrealistic


To feel so nihilistic

Don't judge the stage of my mind
'Cos brother we're two of a kind



We gotta keep dancing

Through the years


We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times



We gotta keep dancing
Through the years


We gotta keep smiling

Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times



Each night twisting

Turning in my bed

I'm trying to make sense of it all

Is it all in my head?



These darker times
Who shall I talk to now


Nothing going on in your eyes

Only the darkness in your eyes

It's a soulless situation

It's a spiritual vacation

Turn on the TV

Pass the remote

Turn off the light

And abandon all hope



We gotta keep dancing

Through the years

We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here
In these darker times




We gotta keep dancing

Through the years

We gotta keep smiling

Through our tears

Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times



We gotta keep dancing
Through the years


We gotta keep smiling
Through our tears


Nobody knows where we go from here

In these darker times
