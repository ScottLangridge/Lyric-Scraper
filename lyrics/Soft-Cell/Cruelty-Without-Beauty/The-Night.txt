Beware
Of his promise
Believe
What I say
Before
I go forever
Be sure
Of what you say

So he paints a pretty picture
And he tells you that he needs you
And he covers you with flowers
And he always keeps you dreaming
If he always keeps you dreaming
You won't have a lonely hour
If a day could last forever
You might like your ivory tower

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yeah the night begins to turn your head around

Beware
Of his promise
Believe
What I say
Before
I go forever
Be sure
Of what you say

For the words may come too easy
If you don't believe I'm leaving
And goodbye will come too quickly
If you really think he loves you
If you really think he loves you
You would give your love so sweetly
If that day could last forever
You would fall in love completely

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yeah the night begins to turn your head around

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Yeah the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Oh the night begins to turn your head around
Yeah, the night, the night, the night, the night, the night, the night
Yeah, the night, the night, the night, the night, the night, the night
Oh the night begins to turn your head around
