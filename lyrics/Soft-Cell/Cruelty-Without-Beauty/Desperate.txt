I'll do anything

Anything at all

Just throw a little cash

In my direction

I'll sing anything


From rock to music hall

Just for a morsel of
Your attention


Maybe as a child
I wasn't given

All the love I needed

Maybe I'm a sad

Reflection of today



I'm desperate

I'm desperate

Desperate for love
I'm desperate


Any kind of love

Or attention



Don't have to tempt me

You won't see me resisting

See me in a magazine



Or I'm not existing
I'll parody myself
Just don't leave me on the shelf
Maybe I'm a symptom


Of a bigger problem



I'm desperate
I'm desperate


I'm desperate


Desperate for love
Any kind of love

Or attention



I'm always available

Without hesitation

Opening an envelope?

Just send an invitation

I'll dance for you

Pose for you

Take off all my clothes for you

Speak your words

Sing your song


Going gone!
I'm up for auction



I'm desperate

I'm desperate

I'm desperate


I'm desperate
I'm desperate

I'm desperate


Desperate for love
Any kind of love
Or attention


Any kind of love
Or attention


Any kind of love

Or attention
