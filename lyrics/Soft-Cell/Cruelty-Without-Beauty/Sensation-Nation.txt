Sensation nation
Sensation nation
Sensation nation
Sensation nation

It's all so deliciously wicked
This decadent life we're living
If you see me as a victim
Could you be a little more forgiving
It's become a media circus
This colourful life we're leading
If I cry just a little more
Would you be less disbelieving

So take me higher
For a quick fix of desire
We're happy shiny people
With nasty little thoughts

Sensation nation
(I'm one of the)
Sensation nation

So hello all you shiny people
Have you got all that you ever wanted
Or is there still something missing
Is that why you're always reminiscing
It's all so deliciously wicked
This decadent life we're leading
It's all before your high has faded
Here's a mantra for the jaded

So take me higher
For a quick fix of desire
We're happy shiny people
With nasty little thoughts

Sensation nation
(I love it, got to have it)
Sensation nation
(give me more, give me more, more, more)
Sensation nation
I'm one of the, I'm one of the
Sensation nation

So take me higher
For a quick fix of desire
We're happy shiny people
With nasty little thoughts

Sensation nation
(I love it, I love it)
Sensation nation

Sensation nation
(Give me more, give me more, more, more)
Sensation nation
(I'm one of the)
Sensation nation
I love it
Sensation nation
Got to have it
We're happy shiny people
With nasty little thoughts
