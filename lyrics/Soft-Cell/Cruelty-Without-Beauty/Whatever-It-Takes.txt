I'm having a mid-life crisis

Behaving in strange ways

Wandering around the supermarket

In a daze

I try to fill my head
With positive thoughts


Try to get a rush


From the merchandise I bought



Out of my head

Where do we go
Out of my head

When the feelings are dead



Whatever it takes

To get me through
Whatever it takes


To stop me missing you

Whatever it takes

To get me through

Whatever it takes

To stop me missing you



I tried meditation

Crystal therapy

Colonic irrigation

Didn't agree with me


Road rage and new age
Just tricks of the mind

The onset of middle age

Is all that I find



Out of my head

Out of my head

Where do we go


When the feelings are dead


Whatever it takes
To get me through


Whatever it takes

To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes


To get me through
Whatever it takes


To stop me missing you



Whatever whatever whatever...

Whatever whatever whatever




Whatever it takes
To get me through

Whatever it takes

To stop me missing you

Whatever it takes

To get me through
Whatever it takes


To stop me missing you

Whatever it takes

To stop me missing you
Whatever it takes

When only you will do




I'm having a mid life crisis


Help me
I'm having a mid life crisis

Help me

Pour me a drink

Chop me a line

Roll me a joint

Sir, you're credit card's declined
