Another day melts into the evening

I sit alone and watch the stars

Remembering times

I think of the past

Here in my isolation

In the solitary situation

Reality hurts

Where memories last

When you whisper my name in the silence

You stop my heart with a touch of violence

We'll always be

Together alone

You're a breath in my ear

You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own

Just two of a kind

Together alone

Together alone

You share in my deepest secrets
You're here in my darkest moment

Together alone
Together alone

You know what I'm always thinking

You lift my mood when I'm sinking

Together alone

Together alone

When you're here in my arms
I'm dreaming of you

Life will end when I stop

Believing in you

Together alone

Together alone

You're like a shadow

At the edge of my eye

Like a chill in the air

Like a light in the sky

Like the endless peace after we die

You're a breath in my ear

You're a word in my mind

I'm here on my own

Just two of a kind

Together alone

Together alone

I don't need anybody

I don't want anybody

I'm on my own

Together alone

Nobody can understand us

Nobody to make demands on us

Together alone

Together alone

And as the bombs are falling

I hear a voice that's calling
Together alone

Together alone

You're a breath in my ear

You're a word in my mind

I'm here on my own

Just two of a kind
Together alone

Together alone

Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?

Together alone

Together alone

You're deep in my heart now

You're deep in my soul now
Together alone

Forever alone

You're a breath in my ear

You're a word in my mind
I'm here on my own

Just two of a kind

Together alone
Together alone

Together alone
Forever alone

Are you listening to me now?

Are you listening to me now?

Together alone

Forever alone
Together alone

Together alone

Are you listening to me now?
Are you listening to me now?
