I'm all out of love

Have I given too much

I'm all out of love
Because there's never enough

I'm all out of love

Have I given too much

I'm all out of love

Drawing up all my years

I'm trying to feel something

Calling on my lost tears

Just trying to feel

Summoning all my passion

Some place I've long forgotten

My anxieties magnify

Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love

There's never enough

I'm all out of love
I'm all out of love

Have I given too much

I'm all out of love

So many doubts

So many fears

All those demons that rise

With the years

Love came calling
But the cupboard was bare

I try to find my heart

But it wasn't there

Am I a spent force?

Used up?

Washed up?

Left out to dry?

Is it the same for everybody

Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love

There's never enough
I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love

Have I given too much
I'm all out of love

When regret comes to call

It's a fear that visits us all
Any love that's left is mine

To keep me warm

For what's left of my time

If I could I'd sit and cry
As the final act approaches

But I'm drained of all emotion

Doctor can you tell me why?

I'm all out of love

There's never enough
I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love

Have I given too much

I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love

I've given too much

I'm all out of love
Never enough

I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love

All out of love

There is nothing left

I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love

I'm all out of love
