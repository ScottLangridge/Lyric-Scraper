In a city lost in time
Somewhere sordid and sublime


We met over a gin and lime
One rainy evening



Survivors clinging to the mast
Trying to make the moment last just

Two people way past their prime

And how it shows



So come over here
For some romance


And dance with me

Like it's the last dance

And come home with me

Won't you come home with me

This is our last chance for love



You thought you looked like Carol White

Bleached hair piled upon your head but

You looked more like a lady of the night

Instead

In your see-through plastic mac


Homage to cheap sixties tack you're
So far out You're on your way back in
Again




I've wasted too many chances

On small ads and Internet romances

So come home with me

Won't you come home with me
This is our last chance for love




I toyed with a cigarette

Trying to look aloof and sexy

But I couldn't see for the smoke

In my eyes

OK, I have a shaky limp and

Dress a little like a pimp but

After your drink I'll still look OK

In a good light



I had some dreams where did they all go

Gone with my years

Nothing left to show

So come home with me


Won't you come home with me
This is our last chance for love

Come home with me

Won't you come home with me

This is our last chance
For romance


Our last chance



Come home with me

Won't you come home with me
This is our last chance for love


This is our last chance

This is our last chance for love
