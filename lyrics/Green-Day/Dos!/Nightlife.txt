Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favourite color's candy apple, girl (wtf)
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife

What's that I hear? You wanna go for a ride?
Don't be afraid, boy, to come inside
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need
Chase this with a little lust and greed
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying "Hey boy, come on"
My black heart beats crimson?
Operator, operator let ya boy in
This is nightlife and I'll get under your skin

Taking a ride to my old haunt
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favourite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife

What a thrill, heart beats fast
Sounds like love but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
? Walls? Sugar-coatd balls? (hahaha)
Girls on your bar stools from late last calls
This town is filled with snakes, mistakes and whiskey shakes
It's too late I already cut the brakes

I'm rollin', strollin' into town (come inside)
Is it me or am I going crazy? (it's just you)
This dirty city is my sugar town (sugar town)
My little angel of death is my nightlife
