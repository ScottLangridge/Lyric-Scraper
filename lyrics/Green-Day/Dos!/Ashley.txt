Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now youre crying at a bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Used a tangled mind with your puppet strings
You tangled your desires right in front of my face
You let me into the world but wouldnt let me drink
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste

But time comes around and Im not so naive
Ive finally lost touch cause youre so out of reach
You say that youre fine but I know that you aint
Youre looking like hell and youre no fucking saint

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now youre crying at a bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now youre crying at a bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

You are what you are
A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought
In my memory

Ive tasted cigarettes and liquor on your breath
You used to call it speed but now its crystal meth
Like when I loved you but youre scaring me to death
This careless memory and now I could care less

But time comes around and Im not so naive
Ive finally lost touch cause youre so out of reach
You say that youre fine but I know that you aint
Youre looking like hell and youre no fucking saint

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now youre crying at a bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley!
Are you running around?
Now youre crying at a bloody murder
Ashley!
Are you bumming around?
You are crying on my cold shoulder

Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!
