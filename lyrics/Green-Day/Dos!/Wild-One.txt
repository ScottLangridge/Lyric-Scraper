She, she's my wild one (wild one)
Eyes of panic, why should she panic now?
She, little wild one (wild one)
My little angel, with demons and halos now

Give up on Jesus, forever the Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
Keeping me cool
Jump on the planet
Open your mind to the world, hello

She, she's my wild one (wild one)
Eyes of strangers, from shadows and strangers now
She, little wild one (wild one)
My little angel, with demons and halos now

Give up on Jesus, forever the Venus
All dressed up with nowhere to go
Keeping me cool
Jump on the planet
Open your mind to the world, hello

(Wild one) (x2)

Give up on Jesus, forever the Venus
All fucked up with nowhere to go
Keeping me cool
Jump on the planet
Open your mind to the world, hello

Little wild one (wild one)

My little angel
With demons and halos now (x2)
