Uncomfortable silence
I'll kill it if you want me to
Sound like "I'm like the sir violence" - surveillance? but that doesn't
Make sense
I'll kill it if you want me to
Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind

I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender

Stop when the red lights flash
I'll trade you blood for dirty cash
Life in the catacombs
That make me fee like I'm alone
Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind

I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender

Out of sight, out of mind
Just give in one more time

I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender, I'll make you surrender
