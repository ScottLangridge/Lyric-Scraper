The crowd
Think I wanna rub it the wrong way
Do you wind up in the corner playing a game of chicken?
Well, I'm just gonna kiss you till your lips are bleeding

Anyhow, anywhere
Cast me out
Scream and shout, to the
Cast me out

You're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
I got myself (something) and I need some friction
It's a makeout party in another dimension
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intention

Anyhow, anywhere
Cast me out, cast me out, 
Scream and shout, to the -
Cast me out, cast me out
