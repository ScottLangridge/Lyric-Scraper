I lost my way oh baby this stray heart
Went to another
Can you recover baby?
Ohhh, you are the only one that I'm dreaming of
Your precious heart, was tron apart by me and you

You're not alone
Ohhhhhhh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Ohhhhhhh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

I said thousand times and now a thousand one
We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you
You start discussing for our home to your heart
We'll never part 
I'll never stray again from you

You're not alone
Ohhhhhhh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Ohhhhhhh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

[Guitar solo]

You're not alone
Ohhhhhhh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Ohhhhhhh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I juuuuuuuuuuust, just can't have you...
