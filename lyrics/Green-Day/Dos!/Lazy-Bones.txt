Im too tired to be bored. 
Im too bored to be tired. 
And, the silence is so deafening its like picking at a sore.

Im too mental to go crazy. 
Im too drunk too be pure. 
And, my mind is playing tricks on me. 
And, I cant sleep tonight cause Im so tired.

I cant take it anymore. 
With all the liars, like a prisoner of war. 
I dont want your sympathy. 
I dont want your honesty. 
I just want to get some peace of mind. 
Its only in my head as I roll over and play dead. 
I dont want to hear it anymore.

Its good to see you, 
But I really must admit, 
Theres an odor in the air and I think you look like shit. 
I cant stand from falling down. 
Im too sick to throw up. 
Everyone keeps talking and they cant shut the fuck up cause Im so tired.

I cant take it anymore. 
With all the liars, like a prisoner of war. 
I dont want your sympathy. 
I dont want your honesty. 
I just want to get some peace of mind. 
Its only in my head as I roll over and play dead. 
I dont want to hear it anymore.

I dont want your sympathy. 
I dont want your honesty. 
I just want to get some peace of mind. 
Its only in my head as I roll over and play dead. 
I dont want to hear about it. 
I dont want to scream about it. 
I dont want to hear it anymore.
