Well I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beat screams sinning clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes

Well she just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like a loss of temptation, living on my inner demons
I don't want to suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be a friend

Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you want to play a game of Twister
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter?
I don't want to suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be a friend

Well I don't want to make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawin' blood and lonely stars
Drink and kiss for cheap guitars
I don't want to suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be a friend

Oh, your friend
