Turn out the lights
Close your eyes
Tear up the silence
The heartache of your life
Dance forever
Under the lights
This brutal love

Of how you want it
Youre beggin for it
But you cant have it
Even if you tried
Its in the clutches
In the hands of
This brutal love

All toys
This plastic hard
Lovers and fools
Are tearing me apart
Here comes trouble
The uninvited
This brutal love

Danger
Not quite at home
The price of temptation
The flesh on my bones
Hello stranger
Im a disaster
This brutal love

My book
Pities and dishonor
Anguish and shame
Were more than through

Mad s**
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my trouble
Miiiiine

My book
Pities and dishonor
Anguish and shame
Were more than through

Mad s**
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my troubled
Miiiiind

Mad love
Kiss me, Im over it
Something for my troubled
Miiiiind

Dropped out
Dropped it in years
Our love is whispered on the low

Dropped out
Dropped it in years
Our love is whispered on the low

Dropped out
Dropped it in years
Our love is whispered on the low

Dropped out
Dropped it in years
Our love is whispered on the low

Whispered love
