This time
Ive gotta put my guard down
And pick myself up off the ground
And take the pain

Itll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains remind me
That Im still living

Well its not too late
Girl its really not worth the fight
No ones right
Well its time to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Well the bigger that you call
All the lying I cant afford

Walk away
Walk away

Did you win?
Oh baby, did you lose?
Now youre gonna lick your wounds anyway
But it comes back to you

When you fall
Youre gonna need a parachute
Only a spare of shoes to go
And walk away

Well its not too late
Girl its really not worth the fight
No ones right
Well its time to walk away

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Well the bigger that you call
All the lying I cant afford

Walk away
Walk away

Walk away

Eh eh eh eh eh
Walk away

Eh eh eh eh eh
Walk away

Well the bigger that you call
All the lying I cant afford

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Walk away
