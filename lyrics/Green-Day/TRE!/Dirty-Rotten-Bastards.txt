Yeahhh, yeah, yeah
Yeahhh, yeah, yeah
Yeahhh, yeah, yeah

Calling all the demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery
Here's to the wasted
I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times
Gonna take it further
Get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers
Ra da da da de
The bottom-feeder's frenzy
Here's to all blood suckers
Sing along with me
'Cause we don't say no scream 1, 2, 3

Yeahhh, yeah, yeah
Yeahhh, yeah, yeah
Hey

We're too old to be misbehaved
We sold our souls and so ashamed of ourselves
So we wait for Miss Judgment Day
Write me a letter and send it to my grave

All fucked up beyond intervention
Fuck the world this is my revolution
Long lost souls and livin' in cages
I'm on a bender
It's one for the ages
I've got the urge to binge and surge
The tables turn to crash and burn

Juliana homicide
Make my demons come to life
Julianna homicide
Why won't you be my blushing bride
Chop me a line of my best friend's ashes
Dust to dust, when the red lights flashes
What the fuck does "OK" stand for,
When the afterlife is nothing worth dying for?
I've got the urge to binge and surge
The tables turn to crash and burn

Julianna homicide
Make my demons come to life
Oh, Julianna homicide
Oh, why won't you be my blushing bride, alright!

Wow

California's burning to the ground
And Julianna walks on holy ground
Where there's smoke there's fire
Burning out of the lights
'Cause California's burning down tonight
Tonight!

Calling all demons, this is the season
Next stop is therapy
We're the retarded and the brokenhearted
The season of misery

Here's to the wasted
I can almost taste it
The rejects and waste of times

Gonna take it further
Get away with murder
And no one here is getting out alive

Here's to all God's losers
Ra da da da de
The bottom-feeder's frenzy
Here's to all blood suckers
Sing along with me
'Cause we don't say no scream 1, 2, 3

We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
We're carried away, carried away, carried away
