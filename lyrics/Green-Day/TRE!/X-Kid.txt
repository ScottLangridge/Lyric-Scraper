Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
You're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your old glory but now it's gone

I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall
Then I crashed, into a wall
Then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you're sick to death

Bombs away, here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over and out
Over and out again

I once was old enough
To know better, then I was too young to care
But who cares, probably would but
Hollywood is dead and gone

You fell in love but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head
Youre an X-Kid and you never even got started again

Bombs away, here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over and out
Over and out

And you were searching your soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
Died of a broken heart

Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
You're not so young, but you're still dumb
Youre an X-Kid and you never even got started again

Bombs away, here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing
The shouting's over and out
Over and out
Over and over and out
