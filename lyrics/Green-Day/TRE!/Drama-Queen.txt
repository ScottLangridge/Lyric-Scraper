She is my drama queen
She is so wild and reckless
There goes my drama queen
She dangles from her necklace

Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
There goes my drama queen
She's old enough to bleed now

There goes my drama queen
Her life has now unfolded
There goes my drama queen
Well do you think she's holding?
There goes my drama queen
Well did she find her savior?
There goes my drama queen
She better call a lawyer
Daddy's little bundle of joy
Out of a magazine
There goes my drama queen
She's old enough to bleed now

She's old enough to bleed now
