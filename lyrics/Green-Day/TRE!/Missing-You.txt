Waking up feeling naked
In my clothes, inside a room thats vacant
Lost my nerve, its unnerving
I know there is something Im forgetting

I searched the moon, I lost my head, 
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the streets
Im pounding the pavement looking

Im missing you
Im missing you
Youre not around and Im a complete disaster
Im missing you

Remember, was our first time
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Dont forget, cause its not over
Im not lost cuz Im just missing you

I searched the moon, I lost my head, 
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the streets
Im pounding the pavement looking

Im missing you
Im missing you
Youre not around and Im a complete disaster
Im missing you

Say hey! 

Well shes my bud
And shes my soul
I get so lost
Out in the cold

Feels so far
Like this lone star
It gets so hard
When Im missing you

Im missing you
Im missing you
Youre not around and Im a fuckin disaster
Im missing you
