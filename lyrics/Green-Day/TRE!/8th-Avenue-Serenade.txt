Chorus:

Say hello from your window
Say goodbye from your car
Say goodnight from your pillow
Say so long from the stars

Take me out, out of my life
Just sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs from a new life
Don't forget to pass me by

My imagination runs away
On this 8th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the Wishing Wall
Before all the flames burn out

My imagination runs away
On this 8th avenue serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
See you at the Wishing Wall
Before all the flames burn out
