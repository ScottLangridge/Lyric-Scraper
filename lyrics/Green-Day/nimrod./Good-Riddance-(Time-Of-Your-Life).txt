[Verse 1]
Another turning point a fork stuck in the road,
Time grabs you by the wrist, and di-rects you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time

[Chorus]
Its something unpre-dictable but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life.

[Verse 2]
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf and in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

[Chorus]
Its something unpre-dictable but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life.

[Chorus]
Its something unpre-dictable but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life.

[Chorus]
Its something unpre-dictable but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life.
