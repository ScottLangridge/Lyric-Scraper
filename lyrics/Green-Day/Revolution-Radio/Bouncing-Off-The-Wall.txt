[Verse 1]
Concrete dream, hey!
I'm gonna make a scene radio
Caught burning gasoline, sleeping in reverse,
And everybody's bouncing off the walls.

Bombs away, hey!
It's just another day,
And I don't tread.
The secret of the day,
I wouldn't sweat it
And everybody's bouncing off the walls.
I'm bouncing off the walls!
Alright!

Concrete kiss, hey!
Come on and do the twist, radio.
My little exorcist, we're all getting pissed,
And everybody's bouncing off the walls.

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all that I want,
And I want to be free,
I got Satan riding next to me.
'Cause we're all bloody freaks,
And we'll give you the creeps,
Chasing fireflies and zeroes!

'Cause it's all that I want,
And I want to be free,
I got Satan riding next to me.
'Cause we're all bloody freaks,
And we'll give you the creeps,
Chasing fireflies and zeroes!
