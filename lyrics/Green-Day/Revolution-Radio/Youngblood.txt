[Intro]
Young blood, young blood, young blood,
She's my little young blood.
Young blood, young blood, young blood,
Punch-drunken young blood.

[Verse 1]
She's a loner, not a stoner,
Bleeding heart with the soul of Miss Teresa.
Supernova, cherry Cola,
She's the cedar in the trees in Minnesota.
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm a rough boy 'round the edges,
Getting drunk, and fallen in the hedges.
She's my weakness, fucking genius,
Swear to god and I'm not even superstitious.

[Chorus]
Young blood, young blood, young blood,
She's my little young blood.
Young blood, young blood, young blood,
Punch-drunken young blood.

[Hook]
I want to hold you like a gun,
We'll shoot the moon into the sun.
Alright, alright.

[Bridge]
Are you stranded, like I'm stranded?
Do you want to watch the world fall to pieces?
Are you broken,, like I'm broken?
Are you restless?
She said: "Fuck you, I'm from Oakland!"

[Chorus]
Young blood, young blood, young blood,
She's my little young blood.
Young blood, young blood, young blood,
Punch-drunken young blood.
