[Verse 1]
My name is Billie and I'm freaking out,
I thought before I was and I can't get it figured out.
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers,
Screaming my memories as if I was never there.

[Chorus]
Standing at the edge of the world,
It's giving me the chills.
Looking down the edge of the world,
Lost in a tangle, it's freaking me out.
Burning lights and Blackouts,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world.

[Verse 2]
I'm like a punk rocker on labor day,
How the hell did I work so hard to be born this way?
I never learned to read or write so well,
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell.

[Chorus]
Standing at the edge of the world,
It's giving me the chills.
Looking down the edge of the world,
Lost in a tangle, it's freaking me out.
Burning lights and Blackouts,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world.

[Hook]
If this is what you call the good life,
I want a better way to die.
If this is what you call the good life,
I want a better way to die.

[Bridge]
Oh, I
Don't wanna think about tomorrow,
Dont wanna think about the road,
It doesnt matter anyway.
Oh, I
Wanna start a revolution,
I wanna hear it on my radio,
I'll put it off another day.
I want a new conspiricy,
And the silence of a thousand cries.
So hurry up, I want a better way to die.

I'm running late to somewhere now, I don't want to be,
Where the future and promises, ain't what it used to be.
I never wanted to compromise or bargain with my soul,
How did life on the wild side ever get so full?

Somewhere now,
Somewhere now,
Somewhere now,
Somewhere now
Don't wanna think about tomorrow,
Somewhere now,
Dont wanna think about the road,
Somewhere now,
Oh I wanna start a revolution,
Somewhere now.
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more!)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow!
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more!)
Don't wanna think about the road
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more!)
I wanna hear it on my radio, I'll put it on another day!
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more!)
