[Verse 1]
What good is love and peace on earth,
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word,
If no one reads it?
A new day dawning,
Comes without warning,
So don't blink twice.

[Chorus]
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times.

[Verse 2]
What part of history we learned,
When it's repeated?
Some things will never overcome,
If we don't seek it.
The world stops turning,
Paradise burning,
So don't think twice.

[Chorus]
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times.

[Bridge]
We run for cover,
Like a skyscraper's falling down,
Then I wander like a troubled mind.

[Verse 3]
What good is love and peace on earth,
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word,
If no one reads it?
A new day dawning,
Comes without warning,
So don't look twice.

[Chorus]
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times,
We live in troubled times.
