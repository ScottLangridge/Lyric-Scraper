[Intro]
Oh, oh, I love you,
Oh, oh, I do.
I got a sentimental promise for you,
Please don't go away, oh yeah.

[Verse 1]
I was a high school atom bomb,
Going off on the weekends.
Smoking dope and mowing lawns,
And I hated all the new trends.

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and my friends sang "Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh",
It's true, the middle of the road
At least it's better than here.

[Chorus]
Looking for a cause
But all I got was Santa Clause,
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die.
I feel like a cello,
Lost somewhere over the Rainbow.
I'm too scared to dream,
But too dumb to die.

[Verse 2]
My daddy always was on strike,
Going off with the teamsters.
He said that everything will be alright,
Not every Sunday can be Easter.

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The Picket-Line screamed "Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh",
Don't cross, don't cross the line
Because you'll be a scab, not a martyr.

[Chorus]
Looking for a cause,
But all I got was Camouflage,
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die.
I feel like a cello,
Lost somewhere over the rainbow.
I'm too scared to dream,
But too dumb to...

[Chorus]
Looking for a cause,
But all I got was Camouflage,
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die.
I feel like a cello,
Lost somewhere over the rainbow.
I'm too scared to dream,
But too dumb to die.
