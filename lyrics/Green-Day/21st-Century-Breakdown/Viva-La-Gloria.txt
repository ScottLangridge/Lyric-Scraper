Hey, Gloria, are you standing close to the edge?
Look out to the setting sun,
The brink of your vision.

Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie.
The cracks of my skin can prove,
As the years will testify.

Say your prayers and light a fire. 
We're gonna start a war. 
Your slogan's a gun for hire. 
It's what we've waited for.

Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge. 
The fight of our lives been drawn to this undying love.

Gloria, viva la Gloria.
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls.
Falling through broken glass that's slashing through your spirit.
I can hear it like a jilted crowd.

Gloria, where are you Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition. 
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins. 
Ashes to ashes of our youth.

She smashed her knuckles into winter. (Gloria.)
As autumn's wind fades into black. 
She is the saint of all the sinners, (Gloria.)
The one that's fallen through the cracks. 
So don't put a way your burning light.

Gloria, where are you Gloria?
Don't lose your faith to your lost naivet.
Weather the storm and don't look back on last November,
When your banners were burning down.

Gloria, viva la Gloria.
Send me your amnesty down to the brokenhearted.
Bring us the season that we always will remember.
Don't let the bonfires go out.

So, Gloria, send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night.
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life,
Your life.
