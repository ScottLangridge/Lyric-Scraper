Sing us a song of the century
That's louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
Leading us into the Promised Land

Tell us a story that's by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight

They're playing the song of the century
Panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that good night
Sing us a song for me
