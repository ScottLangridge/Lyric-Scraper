Gonna build it up
Just to burn it down
You're the princess
I'm a fucking clown

Stop the presses
'Cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine

You're just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You wanna senorita
And now your heart is gonna break

You're Angel Blue
With teenage traces
Angel Blue
With pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest
Just to see the blood
Now I'm singing out the alphabet
As the tears are putting out my cigarette

We're at the cemetery
So we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead
And everything will be alright

You're Angel Blue
With teenage traces
Angel Blue
With pretty faces

Alright
Stuck in the middle
Between heaven and hell
Alright
Trying to find my better angels

Stab my heart
Like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest
Just to see the blood

Stop the presses
'Cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine

You're just a fucking kid
And no one ever gives you a break
You wanna senorita
And now your heart is gonna break

You're Angel Blue
With teenage traces
Angel Blue
With pretty faces
