I'm taking down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless (it
Sounds like BJ is making a very clear C sound here)
A bunch of shit-talking drama queens and they're all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral than into this high school reunion

April Fool, but you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's so cruel cause you're? the crime
And you're a stupid motherfucker and you're doing the time cause

We're all crazy, you're all crazy
We're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control

Hanging out all by myself, at least I'm in good company
Hey, isn't that old what'shisface that I see walking down the street?
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common and I never liked you anyway (his sneer
Omg)

April Fool, but you're falling in love
When you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel cruisin' son of a bitch
And you're a stupid motherfucker
Save the shit for the pigs cause

We're all crazy, you're all crazy now
We're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control

April Fool, but you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's so cruel cause you're? the crime
And you're a stupid motherfucker and you're doing the time cause

We're all crazy, you're all crazy now
We're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control
