Oh love, oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh life, oh life
Please don't pass me by
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop when the red lights flash, 
Oh ride, free ride
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
I'm wearing my heart on a noose.

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose.

Oh lights
And action, 
I just can't be satisfied.

Oh losers
And choosers, 
Won't you please hold on my life?

Oh hours, 
And hours, 
Like the dog years of the day.

Old story, 
Same old story, 
Won't you see the light of day?

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
I'm wearing my heart on a noose. 

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose.

Talk myself out of feeling, 
Talk my way out of control, 
Talk myself out of falling in love, 
Falling in love with you.
 
Oh love, 
Oh love, 
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh ride, 
Free ride, 
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
I'm wearing my heart on a noose. 

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose. 

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
I'm wearing my heart on a noose.

Far away, far away, 
Waste away tonight, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose. 

Tonight my heart's on the loose, 
Tonight my heart's on the loose.
