Breaking in a sweat
Like a bomb treat
Is your silhouette fading out

Nothing left to lose
Detonate the fuse
Another breaking news blowout

Ain't it beautiful
So unusual
Life's a gas and it's running out

Living a clich
Gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving alright

A blink of an eye
Barely scraping by
Dominated by passer by's

Feeling out of luck
When the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind

Getting off a binge
Get a second wind
Another promise to make a change

Got a broken wing
Hear the angels sing
When the signal is out of range, ain't it strange, ain't it strange

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving alright

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving alright

Carpe Diem, a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die
