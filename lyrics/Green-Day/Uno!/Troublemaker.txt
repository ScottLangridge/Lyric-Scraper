Hey!
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm sitting at the traffic light

Hey!
I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium, delirium
On the lower east side of your mind

I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker

Hey!
I like your bmw
I like your bm excellent tits
With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue

Hey!
You're living at the W
You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as hell
Sun burn in a pink bathing suit

I wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker
I Wanna be a troublemaker
Wanna be a troublemaker

Easy c** and go
Gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out
With a shot of Patron
I wouldn't say I'm straight
'Cause I'm bent out of shape
From now till death do we party
Just before it's too late

Hey!
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest when I'm sitting at the traffic light

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
