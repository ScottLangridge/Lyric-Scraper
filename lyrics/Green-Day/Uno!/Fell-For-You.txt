I woke up in pool of sweat
First thought that I pissed the bed
Haunted stories in the midnight hour
The kiss of death from the Eiffel Tower

Then I went down
Like the speed of sound
You're out of sight
But not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck
And I fell for you

I'll spend the night
Living in denial
Making paper planes
Just for a while

I'll crash into you
I crash into you
'Cause you crashed in my imagination too

Break a leg and crush my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
I steal a kiss then I took a dive

Then I went down
Like the speed of sound
You're out of sight
But not out of mind

I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck
And I fell for you

I'll spend the night
Living in denial
Making paper planes
Just for a while

I'll crash into you
I crash into you
'Cause you crashed in my imagination

I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck
And I fell for you
And I fell for you
And I fell for you
