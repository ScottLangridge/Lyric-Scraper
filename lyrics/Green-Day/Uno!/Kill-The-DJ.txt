Walking after dark,
In the New York City park.
Your thoughts are so unholy,
In the holiest of holes.
Onward Christian soldiers,
Filled with jive and mind control.

[Pre-Chorus:]
The blood left on the dance floor running, running red.
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death.
Unless you,

[Chorus:]
Someone kill the dj,
Shoot the fucking dj,
Someone kill the dj,
Shoot the fucking dj.
Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj
Voices in my head are saying
"Shoot that fucker down!"

We are the vultures the dirtiest kind,
The culture wars in your heart and mind.

Walking after dark,
In the New York City park.
Beer goggles left in the club,
My pocket full of pills.
Sodom and Gommorah,
In the century of thrills.

[Pre-Chorus:]
The blood left on the dance floor running, running red.
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death.
Unless you,

[Chorus:]
Someone kill the dj,
Shoot the fucking dj,
Someone kill the dj,
Shoot the fucking dj.
Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj
Hold him underwater
'Till the motherfucker drowns

We are the vultures the dirtiest kind,
The culture wars in your heart and mind.

Someone's gonna to get you boy,
Shoot that fucker down.

Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj
Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj
(Walking after dark)

Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj
Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj

Someone kill the dj
Shoot the fucking dj
Voices in my head are saying
"Shoot that fucker down!"
