Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched
2, 000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now
For so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut of dislogic and smut
A side of you well hid
When it's all said and done
It's real and it's been fun
But was it all REAL fun?

Let's nuke the bridge we torched
2,000 times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've felt this burning in my guts now
For so long
My belly's aching now to say
To say...

You're just... a fuck,
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck.
I'm take-
-in pride
In telling you to fuck off and die.

I've had this burning in my guts now
For so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in the doubts
I've passed to you
So listen up as you might missss... uh

You're just... a fuck,
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck.
I'm take-
-in pride
In telling you to fuck off and die.

Goood niiiiiiiiight...
