(Hidden Track at the end of Dookie sung by Tre Cool,
To hear this song keep FOD playing after the song has
Ended and wait about one minute and this will start playing)

I was alone
I was all by myself
No one was looking
I was thinking of you
Oh yeah did I mention,
I was all by myself

All by myself(x3)

I went to your house
But no one was there
I went in your room
I was all by myself
You and me had
Such wonderful times
When I'm all by myself

All by myself (x2)
