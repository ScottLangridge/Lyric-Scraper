I don't know you
But, I think I hate you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become
My biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face

Maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb

You're the cloud hanging out over my head
Hail comes crashing down
Welting my face
magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still get one over on me

Maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
