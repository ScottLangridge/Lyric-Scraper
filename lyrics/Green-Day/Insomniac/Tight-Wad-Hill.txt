Cheapskate on the hill
A thrill seeker makin' deals
Sugar city urchin wastin' time

Town of lunatics
Beggin' for another fix
Turnin' tricks for speed balls
One more night

Makin' your rounds once again
Turnin' up empty handed
Bummin' a ride
Burnin' daylight
Last up at dawn Tight Wad Hill

Drugstore hooligan
Another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill

Livin' out a lie
But havin' the time of his life
Hatin' every minute of his existence

Makin' your rounds once again
Turnin' up empty handed
Bummin' a ride
Burnin' daylight
Last up at dawn Tight Wad Hill

Makin' your rounds once again
Turnin' up empty handed
Bummin' a ride
Burnin' daylight
Last up at dawn Tight Wad Hill
