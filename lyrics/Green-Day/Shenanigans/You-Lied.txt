You gotta problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath has taken up all the air
Your teeth are rotting
To black holes in your head
Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story is streched and so far-fetched
That you're lacking an excuse

You Lied...

Your mother allowed you
For just one white lie
But now she's dead
And she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growin
Into the 3rd dimension
Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched
And so far-fetched
That you're lacking an excuse

You Lied...

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched
And so far-fetched
That you're lacking an excuse

You Lied...
