You come around every now and then
Your clothes are different,
But you're still the same
Why else would you come here?
Scumbag on a mission

You're telling me it's been a while
Shit-eating grin and a brand new life
Somebody let you come here
Scumbag with permission

Never though I'd see the like of you around this place
What's the special occasion?
Did you run outta friends?

Hear you are comin' 'round again
And things are different but you still pretend
You gotta reason to come here
Scumbag with ambition

And now you're telling me that things have changed
And you'll leaving in a couple days
You're gonna change the world someday
Scumbag with a vision

It must be nice to know you got it all figured out
But from where I'm sitting,
It's the same thing again and again

Have you ever stopped to think
Before you opened up your mouth?
Because everytime you do,
It's the same thing again and again
