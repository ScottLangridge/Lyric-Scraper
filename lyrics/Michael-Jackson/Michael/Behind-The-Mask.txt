All along I had to talk
About it
Like a two edged sword,
He touched you and it stabs (me)

Chorus:
All along I knew you were
A phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world

Yesterday he held you in his arms
But when I'm holdin' you
Feel it's bitter charms
I can't judge what you're doin' to me
You camouflage the truth,
Indulge your fantasy

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

Who do you love?
Is it me?
Is it him?
I don't know!

There is nothing in your eyes
(There is nothing in your eyes)
But that's the way you cry
(But that's the way you cry, girl)
All is grand, all is bright
(All is grand, all is bright)
You're just srudyng my mind
(You're just srudyng my mind)

Was I invited to your masquerade?
Well, the party's over so
Now take off the face
You say you love, but it's hard to see
'Cause when you're in his arms
You're throwing rocks at me

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

There is nothing in your eyes
(There is nothing in your eyes)
But that's the way you cry
(But that's the way you cry, girl)
All is grand, all is bright
(All is grand, all is bright)
You're just srudyng my mind
Eh, eh, eh

I walk around I'm sufferein'
In my doom
When I come to you,
You're sittin' in our room
The truth in you I have
Long to trace
So take off the mask so
I can see your face

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

What talk about?
What talk about?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
