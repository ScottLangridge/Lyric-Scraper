She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay, 
She's looking for the hope and the empty promises, 
She's working two jobs, keeping alive, 
She works in a restaurant during day, 
She waits her life away, 
She wipes her tears away.
She hides inside every time she feels this way, 
And she's... inside, every time her baby cries.

Chorus:
Keeping your head up to the sky! 
Keeping your mind up stay alive, 
Give me your wings so we can fly, 
(Keep your head up, tonight! )
Keeping your head up to the sky, 
Or we could just rise up, tell me now?
Give me your wings so we can fly! 

Killing up the life in the birds and the trees, 
And sucking up the air in the earth from under me, 
It's never too late! 
I can't even breathe! 
I can't even see! 
Keep your head up, don't give up, today! 
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today! 
All you need is love, 
Tell you I always come and... 
And all you need is just a moment wanting to
Keep your head up! 

Chorus:
Keeping your head up to the sky! 
Keeping your mind up stay alive, 
Give me your wings so we can fly, 
(Keep your head up, tonight! )
Keeping your head up to the sky, 
Or we could just rise up, tell me now?
Give me your wings so we can fly! 

Everybody say that time is borrowed, 
And hanging down your head is no good, 
And if your day arrives... tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance, 
Fight the circumstance, 
Rising too, again! 

Chorus:
Keeping your head up to the sky! 
Keeping your mind up stay alive, 
Keeping your wings so we can fly, 
(Keep your head up, tonight! ) 
Keeping your head up to the sky, 
Or we could just rise up, tell me now?
Give me your wings so we can fly
