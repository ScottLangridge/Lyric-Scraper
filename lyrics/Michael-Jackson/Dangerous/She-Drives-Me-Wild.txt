She drives me wild
She's Got The Look
She's So Fine
And You Know Damn Well
The Girl Will Be Mine

She's Got The Breaks
She's The Scene
And You Know Damn Well
She Gives It To Me

Black Jeans And
A Turtleneck Sweater
I Know The Girl
Is Fakin' 'Cause
I've Seen Her Look Better

She's Composition
She's Statistical Fact
She Got It Ready
For The Willing
Got It Kicking Of The Back

She Drives me Wild
She's Got the look
Wanna look Better
She's Got the look
She's Driving Me Wild

She's Got the look
Wanting No Break Time
She's Got the look
She's Driving Me Wild

Come To The Place
Shock Tacy
And You Know Damn Well
You Know What I Mean
Hot In The Face
One to 3

Like A Pleasure Trip
Like You've Never Seen (Uh-Uh)
Satin Lace
And A Paisley Cut Top
The Girl Is Wasting Over
Cause She Knows she looks hot

She's Got Position
She's Got Just What It Takes

Got A Mojo
In Her Pocket
Got It Ready
Just In Case

She's Got the look
Wanting No Break Time
She's Got the look
She's Driving Me Wild

She's Got the look
Wanting No Break Time
She's Got the look
She's Driving Me Wild

(Rap)

She's Got the look...
