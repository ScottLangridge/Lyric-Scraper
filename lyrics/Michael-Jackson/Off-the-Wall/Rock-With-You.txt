Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm, get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel the heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus:]
I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into the (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
Theres
[Pre-Chorus] a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
When you feel the heat
And we gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus:]

And when the grove is dead and gone
Yeah, you know that love survives
So we can rock forever
