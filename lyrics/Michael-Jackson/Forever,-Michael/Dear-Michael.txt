She wrote "Dear Michael"
You'll probably never get this letter, Michael
I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel
I'll write a hundred more

"Dear Michael, every time your record's on
(Michael Michael)
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
Dreaming your singing to me

And then she wrote:
Michael, I love you
I've held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings, in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your # 1 fan

I'm gonna answer your letter
(Michael Michael)
I'll start beginning with the abc's of loving you
Your letter really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of
Meeting on the picture
That you sent alone
Signed with all your love

(Michael, Michael)
(She wrote) I'm gonna write you back
Oooh! I promise you that
Girl, I think I love ya
Hurry, hurry Mr. Postman!

Take my letter
Tell her I love her!

(Michael, Michael)

Take my letter, tell her I love her!
