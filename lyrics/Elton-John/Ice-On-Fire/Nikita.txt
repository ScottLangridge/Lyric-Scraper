Hey Nikita, is it cold in your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe and never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row with eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow
Oh Nikita, you will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire, Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time, guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice, just look towards the west and find a friend
Oh Nikita, you will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know

Oh Nikita, you will never know, never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know
(No)
(Nikita) Counting ten tin soldiers in a row (No)
(Nikita) Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita) Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
(Nikita)
