Music by elton john
Lyrics by bernie taupin
Available on the album made in england

I was made in england out of cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father, had a love-me mother
I had little richard and that black piano
Oh that sweet georgia peach and the boy from tupelo

Oh, I was made in england
Oh, I was made in england

I was made in england out of cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground crying God send me a brother
Not a bloody nose for rock and roll
Give me that sweet georgia peach and the boy from tupelo

I was made in england like a blue cortina
But a yankee summer had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal, well heres my middle finger
I had forty years of pain and nothing to cling to

If you're made in england, you're built to last
You can still say homo and everybody laughs
But the jokes on you, you never read the song
They all think they know but they all got it wrong
