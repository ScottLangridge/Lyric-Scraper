It's a human sign when things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers and temptation's strong
Into the boundary of each married man, sweet deceit comes calling and negativity lands
Cold, cold heart, hard done by you
Some things look better, baby, just passing through
And it's no sacrifice, just a simple word
It's two hearts living in two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice, it's no sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstanding after the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison in the final act
We lose direction, no stone unturned
No tears to damn you when jealousy burns
Cold, cold heart, hard done by you
Some things look better, baby, just passing through
And it's no sacrifice, just a simple word
It's two hearts living in two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice, it's no sacrifice at all

Cold, cold heart, hard done by you
Some things look better, baby, just passing through
And it's no sacrifice, just a simple word
It's two hearts living in two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice, it's no sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
