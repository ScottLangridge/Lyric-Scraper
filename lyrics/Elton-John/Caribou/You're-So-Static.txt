Available on the album caribou

I've a constant ache in the morning light
Its on account of the night before
Some park lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore

But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watchll do instead

City living woman, you're so static
Matching your men with a hook and eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in new york city
Them women oh oh oh they're gonna slice your pie

Said you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
If they catch you, oh oh oh it could turn out bad

Its a show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time
Shes a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying
