I remember when rock was young, me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking 'Round The Clock, we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama, those Friday nights when Suzie wore her dresses tight and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of the Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama, those Friday nights when Suzie wore her dresses tight and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

I remember when rock was young, me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking 'Round The Clock, we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama, those Friday nights when Suzie wore her dresses tight and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
