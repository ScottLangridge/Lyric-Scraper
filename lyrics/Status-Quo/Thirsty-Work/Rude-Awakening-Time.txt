(RossiFrost)
It's time to make it better, it's rude awakening time
So write it in a letter and you can clear your mind
You make me very happy, you make me very sad
It's time to make it better, the best I ever had
It's time to make it better, but nothing lasts for ever
It's rude awakening time

So get moving and get yourself off my bed
Well get moving and get yourself gone instead.
You been away so long you can't find your way home
You've been using and wrapped yourself round your head
You're confusing everything that you said
You been so far gone so gone so far so long
You been gone so long so gone so far so long

It's time to make it better, it's rude awakening time
Well write it in a letter and you can clear your mind
You make me very happy, you make me very sad
It's time to make it better, the best I ever had
It's time to make it better, but nothing lasts for ever
It's rude awakening time

And just maybe you oughta think twice ahead.
It's been a long, long time since you've been close to home

It's time to make it better, it's rude awakening time
Well write it in a letter and you can clear your mind
You make me very happy, you make me very sad
It's time to make it better, the best I ever had
It's time to make it better, and nothing lasts for ever
It's rude awakening time

You've been rollin' and rockin' it another way
You've been slowly giving up day by day
You been so far gone so gone so far so long
You been gone so long so gone so far so long
