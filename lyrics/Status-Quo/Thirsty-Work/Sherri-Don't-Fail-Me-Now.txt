(Bown / Edwards)

Got a mess in my backyard
I'm gonna clean it all up
Stop a-doing things backwards
Start struttin 'my stuff
Oh now the time has come to change
Strawberry fields
Kicking my heels
Losing my place
And forgetting my name

There's a cupboard in my room
I got a skeleton key
Gonna crack it wide open
Stop 'em following me
Oh now it's time to change it all
The gohst's still there
I'm tearing my hair
Chewing my nails
And I'm climbing the walls

But it's alright
If I got a problem
You got all the answers
Stay this night
I'll make it up to you
In some way somehow
Oh but Sherri don't fail me now

Gonna get a black spotlight
Gonna stage a new plan
Gonna wash away the bloodstains
Stop scrubbing my hands
Oh no but here it comes again
A dirty sea
Is swallowing me
I'm fighting for air
On the dangerous bends

But it's alright
If I got a problem
You got all the answers
Stay this night
I'll make it up to you
In some way somehow
Oh but Sherri don't fail me now

But it's alright
If I got a problem
You got all the answers
Stay this night
I'll make it up to you
In some way somehow
Oh but Sherri don't fail me now
Oh but Sherri don't fail me now
