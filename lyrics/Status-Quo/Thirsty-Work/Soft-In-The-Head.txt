Soft In The Head
(Rossi / Frost)

Soft in the head, I must be soft in the head
Out of my head, I'm probably out of my head
Things that I said are only things that I said
Soft in the head I must be
Out of my head, I must be out of my head
Soft in the head I must be

I've never been so worried 'bout the things I do
I've never thought of people, I'm a liar too
So won't you listen to me and the things I say
Maybe you'll go home one day

And if I leave you thinking 'bout the things you do
And I leave you looking for an answer too
Such a silly question that I ever knew
Daddy, why these holes so deep?

But I don't believe in not believing in miracles
Anything could happen now
We all need a guiding light in the alleyway
Funny how it all works out
Funny how it all works out

Soft in the head, I must be soft in the head
Out of my head, I'm probably out of my head
Things that I said are only things that I said
Soft in the head I must be
Out of my head, I must be out of my head
Soft in the head I must be

I've got a great big problem that I can't work out
I've got a bunch of people gonna wear me out
Got a funny feeling it's all in the air
We're all going home one day

But I don't believe in not believing in miracles
Anything could happen now
We all need a guiding light in the alleyway
Funny how it all works out

But I don't believe in not believing in miracles
Anything could happen now
We all need a guiding light in the alleyway
Funny how it all works out
