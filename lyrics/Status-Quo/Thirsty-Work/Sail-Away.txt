(Rossi / Frost)

Sail away to the place across the sea
Leave today so you cannot bother me
And you cannot fail to see
That it doesn't really matter much to me
No it doesn't really matter that much to me

Blown away any time I wanted you
Played away so I thought I'd try it too
Just to see what I could do
But it didn't really matter much to me
No it didn't really matter that much to me

Living on the east side, looking to the west side
Looking on the bright side, bright side
Stepping over that line, checking out the birth-sign
Making up for lost time, lost time

Sail away, don't believe I give a damn
Go today, go and leave me as I am
I'll remember when I can
And it doesn't really matter much to me
No it doesn't really matter that much to me

Living on the east side, looking to the west side
Looking on the bright side, bright side
Stepping over that line, checking out the birth-sign
Making up for lost time, lost time

Sail away, could it be I've found away
For today is the day I'm gonna write
'Bout the story of my life
Will it ever really matter much to me
Will it ever really matter that much to me

Living on the east side, looking to the west side
Looking on the bright side, bright side
Stepping over that line, checking out the birth-sign
Making up for lost time, lost time
Living on the east side, looking to the west side
Looking on the bright side, bright side...
