(Rossi/Frost)

A long time ago I saw you there
Sitting in a corner chair
I was looking for a place to stay
You were only hanging out and hanging around
I didn't see what I was looking for
I guess I never really knew
I was looking for a private eye
You never knew what I was talking about

Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
Won't you come along and make a home with me
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could settle down and make some history
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could never stop it if we wanted to
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could be so happy with a family

The next time I saw you was the summertime
I'm just a little older now
Things seemed to get a little better then
You went out and got a ticket taking you home
It really was a shame I didn't follow you
It would have saved a lot of time
I had to come around eventually
And ask you if you want to maybe marry me

Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
Won't you come along and make a home with me
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could settle down and make some history
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could never stop it if we wanted to
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could be so happy with a family

Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
Won't you come along and make a home with me
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could settle down and make some history
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could never stop it if we wanted to
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could be so happy with a family

Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
Won't you come along and make a home with me
Queenie, Queenie, Queenie
We could settle down and make some history
