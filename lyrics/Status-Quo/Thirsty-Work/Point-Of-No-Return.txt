( Bown / Edwards )

Is it another day
Is there another way
Nothing at all to say
It's just another day without you
Long way without you
Should I be holding back
Should I be holding out
Should I be keeping quiet
When I could scream and shout about you
All out about you
You, you give me everything but love
Shall I hold on, has it all gone

This is the way it is
This is the point of no return
We get the messages
Still we have everything to learn
Telling it like it is
This is the point of no return

Am I the last to learn
Am I the last to know
Is it a parting shot
Is it the final blow without you
To go without you
You, you give me everything but love
Shall I hold on, has it all gone

This is the way it is
This is the point of no return
We get the messages
Still we have everything to learn
Telling it like it is
This is the point of no return

Always too long, always too far
Always too strong for me to defend
Is it a fade, is it an end

You, you give me everything but love
Shall I hold on, has it all gone

This is the way it is
This is the point of no return
We get the messages
Still we have everything to learn
Telling it like it is
This is the point of no return

This is the way it is
This is the point of no return
We get the messages
Still we have everything to learn
Telling it like it is
This is the point of no return
This is the way it is

The point of no return
The point of no return
The point of no return
The point of no return
The point of no return
The point of no return
