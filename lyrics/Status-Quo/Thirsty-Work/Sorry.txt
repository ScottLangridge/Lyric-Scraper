Whispering, you know I saw you were whispering
Listening, you didn't think I was listening
I got the right things all wrong again, once again
I hurt you, never feeling

Answer me, you know you won't even answer me
After me, I know you won't hurry after me
If you feel that it has to be, as for me
We can't be sure of feelings
Don't fall apart or lose your heart
You're far away, is it clear when I say

Sorry for saying the things I said
Sorry for starting it all
All I can say is sorry to you
And kiss your lips and tell you I love you

Chance today, we had our very last chance today
Romance today, it was our very last chance today
I spin the wheels and I'm fast away, far away
I don't know where but somewhere
Don't fall apart or lose your heart
You're far away, is it clear when I say

Sorry for saying the things I said
Sorry for starting it all
All I can say is sorry to you
And kiss your lips and tell you I love you
Sorry for saying the things I said
Sorry for starting it all
All I can say is sorry to you
And kiss your lips and tell you I love you
Sorry for saying the things I said
Sorry for saying the things I said
Sorry for saying the things I said
