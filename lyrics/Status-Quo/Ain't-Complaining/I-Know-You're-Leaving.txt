(Van Tijnfluitsman)
You say you're tired of this love affair
It brings you down close to despair
Our love has fallen apart at the seems
I was too taken, lived in a dream
All I want is to be around you
So I cry, yes it's all I can do

I know you're leaving but I can't understand
Why what we have must come to an end
Somebody tell me what can I do?
I know you're leaving but I still love you.

You used to hold me, hold me so strong
I never thought we could ever go wrong
Had no intention to fence you in
Give you affection was my only aim
I will learn not to be around you
So I'll cry, yes it's all I can do

I know you're leaving but I can't understand
Why what we have must come to an end
Somebody tell me what can I do?
I know you're leaving but I still love you.

It's an emptiness you leave behind
Broken memories and fate to remind me
What's been done can't be turned around
And hope has become misery

I know you're leaving but I can't understand
Why what we have must come to an end
Somebody tell me what can I do?
I know you're leaving but I...

I know you're leaving but I can't understand
Why what we have must come to an end
Somebody tell me what can I do?
I know you're leaving but I still love you

I know you're leaving, this time it's goodbye
Baby but I still love you
I know you're leaving, this time it's goodbye
Baby but I still love you
I know you're leaving, this time it's goodbye
Baby but I still love you
