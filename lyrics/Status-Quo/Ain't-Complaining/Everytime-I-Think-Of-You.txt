(Edwards / Rich / Paxman)

I wrote a letter
But I threw it away
I can't forget you
That's what I want to say
Anytime or place, just to see your face
Everytime I think of you
You know it makes me sad
That you feel this way
Cause I want you so bad
And it don't seem right
That you won't be here tonight
Everytime I think of you

Everytime I think of you
I wanna shout about it
But waiting's so hard when you live without love
Oh - oh, everytime I think of you

There's nothing left at all
Only a photograph
Hanging on my wall
It was my mistake, but it's my heart that aches
Everytime I think of you

Everytime I think of you
I wanna shout about it
But waiting's so hard when you live without love
Oh - oh, everytime I...

I wrote a letter
Gotta let you know
That I still want you
And I just can't let go
And it still ain't right
That you won't be here tonight
Everytime I think of you

Everytime I think of you
I wanna shout about it
But waiting's so hard when you live without love
Oh - oh, everytime I think of you

Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
