(Rossi / Frost)

I gotta get myself far, far away
I gotta tell myself that anyway
I can't forget the way that you used to be
Now all in all it seems so different to me
I said oh-oh Rosalee
Oh my Rosalee

Oh every time I see you I have to stop
And everybody says you are the cream of the crop
But if you're looking angry in any way
I don't believe I could stand in your way
My one and only carriage, it rolls along
My funny love affair has found a way to go on
I won't change for you, you haven't changed for me
I don't suppose you have an answer for me

I've been around this place for quite a time
I've been around just feeling really fine
I can't believe I feel like nothing today
Well I don't feel too much anyway
I said oh-oh Rosalee
Oh my Rosalee

Oh every time I see you I have to stop
And everybody says you are the cream of the crop
But if you're looking angry in any way
I don't believe I could stand in your way

My one and only carriage, it rolls along
My funny love affair has found a way to go on
I won't change for you, you haven't changed for me
I don't suppose you have an answer for me
Oh every time I see you I have to stop
And everybody says you are the cream of the crop
But if you're looking angry in any way
I don't believe I could stand in your way

My one and only carriage, it rolls along
My funny love affair has found a way to go on
I won't change for you, you haven't changed for me
I don't suppose you have an answer for me
My one and only carriage, it rolls along
My funny love affair has found a way to go on
I won't change for you, you haven't changed for me
I don't suppose you have an answer for me
My one and only carriage, it rolls along
My funny love affair has found a way to go on
I won't change for you, you haven't changed for me
I don't suppose you have an answer for me
