I woke this morning in a different disguise and I was crying, crying
You said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter at all
I caught the mirror as I opened your letter, I was lying, lying
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter at all

Another shipwreck, another heartbreak
Another shipwreck, I understand that
I may never see home again
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak
Another shipwreck, I understand that
I may never see home again

Scared to lose you but knowing the magic, it was dying, dying
I said it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter at all
I hear you every day, I meet you at night, I see you crying, crying
You say it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter at all

Another shipwreck, another heartbreak
Another shipwreck, I understand that
I may never see home again

Another shipwreck, another earthquake
Another shipwreck, I understand it's time to admit
Despite our endeavours
Cant find whatever we lost....

Another shipwreck, another heartbreak
Another shipwreck, I understand that
I may never see home again

Another shipwreck, another heartbreak
Another shipwreck, I understand that
I may never see home again
Another shipwreck, another heartbreak
Another shipwreck, I understand that
I may never see home
I may never see home
I may never see home again

I woke this morning in a different disguise
I cracked a mirror as I opened your letter
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic
I hear you every day I meet you at night
