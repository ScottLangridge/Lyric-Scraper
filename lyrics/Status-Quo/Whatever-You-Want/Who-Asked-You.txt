(Lancaster)

There you go again
Telling me the same mistakes I made
There you go again
Telling me the way I should have played
Your silver tongue can talk away
And tell me all I should have done
But you allways be the same
'til the very last time has come

Seventeen years
And it ain't no worth giving a try you said
But I wouldn't be living
If any year was never spent
So when I see you up in arms
I wonder where your time has gone
Are you throwing it away
'til the every last time has come

Who asked you
To prey on my feelings
Lying low in every cloud
Who asked you
I've never been the one
To give you any kind of reason
Who asked you

Who asked you
When I was still learning
To come along and put me down
Who asked you
I made it anyway
While every cloud was slowly turning
Who asked you
Who asked you

There you go again
Telling me the same mistakes I made
There you go again
Telling me the way I should have played
There never was a better way
Than living like the way I've done
Oh, and living is the game
'til the very last time has come
But you'll always be the same
'til the very last time has come
You're throwing it away
'til the very last time has come

Who asked you
