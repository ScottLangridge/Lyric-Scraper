(Rossi / Frost)

I tell you that it makes me feel so happy
When I'm back here somedays slow some speedy
Now I'm on the go again - never letting go again
Will you then
Won't you then
Try again - try again please
If you like what I like come rock with me
If you like what I like
Oh, I'm rockin' on
Oh, I'm rockin on

I'm with you and I feeling so much better
Something tells me the future looks more easy
When I'm on the go again
Never letting go again
Will you then
Won't you then
Try again - try again please
If you like what I like come rock with me
If you like what I like
Oh, I'm rockin' on
Oh, I'm rockin on
