(ParfittBown)
I would not lie, I've apologised
'Til my face is turning blue
But I just can't get the message through to you
It was all a joke, and we hardly spoke
She was the sister of a friend
And I promise you I won't see her again.

Oh I would not lie 'cos I could not try to fool you
Oh I would not lie 'cos I could not stand to lose you
I know we made mistakes, had some minor breaks
But the song remains the same
And I need to see your smiling face again

Won't you stay for another day
Or maybe another night
Can't you understand that you make me feel alright?
I act uncool but I'm nobody's fool
And you know I'll see you right
Yeah, I promise you I'll make you smile tonight

Oh I would not lie 'cos I could not try to fool you
Oh I would not lie 'cos I could not stand to lose you
I know we made mistakes, had some minor breaks
But the song remains the same
And I need to see your smiling face again

Oh I would not lie 'cos I could not try to fool you
Oh I would not lie 'cos I could not stand to lose you
I know we made mistakes, had some minor breaks
But the song remains the same
And I need to see your smiling face again
