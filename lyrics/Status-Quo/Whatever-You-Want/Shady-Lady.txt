(Rossi / Young)

Run your fingers thru my hair sweet darling
Run your fingers thru my hair
I want you when you never there sweet darling
Need you but I could not care

You got long black hair on your legs
And I like them smooth
You don't show me you care
You won't even move
That's why I call you shady lady

I wish I hadn't turn my head that morning
Wish I hadn't turned my head
Or listened to the things you said that morning
Listened to the things you said

I get away where nobody goes
And she finds me there
She won't leave me alone
She don't even care
That's why I call here shady lady, shady lady

They say, I say
You gotta lay it down the line
So get away-way I say
If you're only playing with my time
I gotta keep you off of my back
Cos you're making me feel so bad
I gotta get along, get along, get along
Without you now

Run your fingers thru my hair sweet darling
Run your fingers thru my hair
I want you when you never there sweet darling
Need you but I could not care

I get away where nobody goes
And she finds me there
She won't leave me alone
She won't even care
That's why I call her shady lady, shady lady

I gotta get along, get along, get along
Without you now
I gotta get along, get along, get along
Without you now
I gotta get along, get along, get along
Without you now
