( Rossi / Frost )

Riding on a high
Riding so high now I'm leaving
Am I running far from my own fears
I'm never facing up
I never face up to the reasons
And never showing any of my tears
Cos I
Leave out the back way
Not the way that I came in
Beacuse it seems like the logical way, at the time

And then I run, run, run
And seek a hideaway
I'm on the run, run, run, I'm falling
Run, run I'm a runaway
Can I go back
Can I go back where I started
I always will remember my needs

Take me far away
Take me away to an island
And leave me hear to cry in my own tears
Try me once again
Try me again when you're passing
Maybe I'll remember you in years

I can't go out the back way
Just the way that I came in
I hope it seems like the logical way, at the time

Beacuse I'll run, run, run
And seek a hideaway
I'm on the run, run, run, I'm falling
Run, run I'm a runaway
Can I go back
Can I go back where I started
I always will remember my needs

Looking for so long
But I am listening longer
I haven't seen or heard a thing from you
I can't stay here
I couldn't stay here if you paid me
I can't give you any guarantees
I won't
Go out the back way
Not the way that I came in
Beacuse it seems like the logical way, at the time

And then I run, run, run
And seek a hideaway
I'm on the run, run, run, I'm falling
Run, run I'm a runaway
Can I go back
Can I go back where I started
I always will remember my needs

Can I go back
Can I go back where I started
I always will remember my needs
I always will remember my needs
I said,I always will remember my needs
