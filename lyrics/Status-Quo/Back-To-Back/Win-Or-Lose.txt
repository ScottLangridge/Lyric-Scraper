( Rossi / Frost )

Win or lose, lose or win
I ain't ever doing that again
Keeping out and never creeping in
No I ain't ever doing that again
I know I've done some silly things
But I ain't ever doing that again
No I ain't ever doing that again

Sailed away to foreign place
Not so far or hard to trace
I didn't wanna know
Knowing I had to go
Left my place of residence
Down the drive and past the fence
I'm coming back again
Wish I could tell you when
I never been away so long before
Surley now I must be sure

Win or lose, lose or win
I ain't ever doing that again
Keeping out and never creeping in
No I ain't ever doing that again
I know I've done some silly things
But I ain't ever doing that again
No I ain't ever doing that again

Got to one place really fine
Getting out to quite a time
A little trouble there
I didn't seem very fair
Tried to go we had a fight
So they made us stay the night
And it was harassing
Very embarrassing
That's another place that I have seen
A place I wish I haven't been

Win or lose, lose or win
I ain't ever doing that again
Keeping out and never creeping in
No I ain't ever doing that again
I know I've done some silly things
But I ain't ever doing that again
No I ain't ever doing that again
I ain't ever doing that again
No I ain't ever doing that again
