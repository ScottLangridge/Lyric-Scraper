Has anybody here seen my way to heaven?
Can anybody care enough for them to tell
It's taken me forever but finally you came
I had to look no further than any other man

Don't look back over your shoulder
'Cos the love that you found
That you found darling, yeah
Use it and stay the night
All you got to do is stay the night
All you got to do is stay the night
All you got to do is stay the night

Whatever is the matter, d'you think you've had enough?
So hang on that bit longer, with me it won't be tough
And don't you know I'm waiting, I have been for so long
So if you're feeling better we're off and we'll be gone

Don't look back over your shoulder
'Cos the love that you found
That you found darling, yeah
Use it and stay the night
All you got to do is stay the night
All you got to do is stay the night
All you got to do is stay the night
