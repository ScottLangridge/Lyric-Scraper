( Parfitt / Bown )

I don't want your lovin' baby
I won't give you mine
I need more than ifs and maybes
To help me pass the time

Give me private lessons
Teach me all you can
Play me silent movies
But remember babe
Oh remember babe
We don't got no contract

I won't buy your lying baby
You won't buy my love
Don't you think no crying baby
I won't take no bluff

Give me private lessons
Teach me all you can
Play me silent movies
But remember babe
Oh remember babe
We don't got no contract

Give me private lessons
Teach me all you can
Play me silent movies
But remember babe
Oh remember babe
We don't got no contract
