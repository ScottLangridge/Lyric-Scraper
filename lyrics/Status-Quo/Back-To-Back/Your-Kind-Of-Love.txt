(Lancaster)
Love makes the world go round each and every day
Your kind of loving gives me something, I'm going round again
Love makes the world go round, and now I know for sure
You are something special to me, I want nothing more, than

Your kind of love, your kind of love
Your kind of love makes the world go round

Your kind of love could never fade away
Something for nothing, your kind of loving, what more can I say?
You make the world go round, you are the night and day
Everybody needs somebody but I'm the only one, with

Your kind of love, your kind of love
Can't take away your kind of love
Makes the world go round, makes the world go round
Your kind of love makes the world go round

Your kind of love, your kind of love
Your kind of love, your kind of love
Makes the world go round, makes the world go round
Your kind of love makes the world go round

Your kind of love, your kind of love
Your kind of love makes the world go round
What kind of love? What kind of love?
What kind of love? Your kind of love.
