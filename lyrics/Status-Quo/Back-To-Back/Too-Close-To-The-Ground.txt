When the light hits your eyes
In the morning
And the fight to survive
Is braking you down

You see a chance for an answer
To fill the empty spaces

But you still don't know what to do
You're too close to the ground

When the night closes in
Like an old friend
And the last of your pills
Is taking you down

You know the doctor's prescription
Ain't working like it used to

But you still don't know what to do
You're too close to the ground, still going down

All your life
You were waiting
Just to pass up the dream
And leave my town

You blew your chance for an answer
To fill the empty spaces

Oh, you just don't know what to do
You're too close to the ground
Too close to the ground, still going down
