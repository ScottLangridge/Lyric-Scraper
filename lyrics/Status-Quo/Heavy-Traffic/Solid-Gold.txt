(rossi / young)

Take a ride to somewhere with me
Anywhere that you want it could be
Sit on back and take it all in
I know where you're going
I know where you've been
A little smile a secretive grin
One more pull and we're out there again
Close your eyes and tell me you see
What you believe in is just you and me
Take it or leave it but take it from me

I'm not worryin' I'm not lookin' back again
I ain't thinking it that way
No-ones tellin' you now what you gotta do
We're not listening that way
Cos' it's gold solid gold
We are gold solid gold

Take a trip and i'll meet you there
We'll hang out on a wing and a prayer
Climb on board and put yourself in
We know where we're goin'
We know where we've been
What do we know of the dangers within

I'm not worryin' I'm not lookin' back again
I ain't thinkin' it that way
No-ones tellin' you now what you gotta do
We're not listening that way
Cos' it's gold solid gold
We are gold solid gold

Take a ride to somewhere with me
Anywhere that you want it could be
Sit on back and take it all in
I know where you go
And I know where you've been
What do we know
Of the dangers within

I'm not worryin' I'm not lookin' back again
I ain't thinkin' it that way
No-ones tellin' you now what you gotta do
We're not listenin' that way

I'm not worryin' I'm not lookin' back again
I ain't thinkin' it that way
No-ones tellin' you now what you gotta do
We're not listenin' that way

Cos it's gold solid gold
We are gold solid gold
