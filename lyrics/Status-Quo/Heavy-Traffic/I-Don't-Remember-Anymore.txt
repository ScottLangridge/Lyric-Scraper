(bown)

I don't remember anymore
I woke up freezin on the floor
My head was buzzin like a saw
I don't remember anymore

She stole the bottle then she said
Your eyes were blue and now they're red
I think i'll carry you to bed
I don't remember anymore

I wanna rock and roll, wanna sell my soul
Sail the tv round the swimming pool
I want my name in lights a la johnny B. Goode
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood

Don't read the writing on the wall
Cos if I'm having me a ball
I stand around till I fall
And don't remember anymore

I wanna rock and roll, wanna sell my soul
Sail the tv round the swimming pool
I want my name in lights a la johnny B. Goode
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood

She stole the bottle then she said
Your eyes were blue and now they're red
I think i'll carry you to bed
I don't remember anymore

I wanna rock and roll, wanna sell my soul
Sail the tv round the swimming pool
I want my name in lights a la johnny B. Goode
Be an all night loon like a ronnie wood

Don't read the writing on the wall
Cos if I'm having me a ball
I stand around till I fall
And don't remember anymore

I don't remember anymore
I don't remember anymore
I don't remember anymore
I don't remember anymore
