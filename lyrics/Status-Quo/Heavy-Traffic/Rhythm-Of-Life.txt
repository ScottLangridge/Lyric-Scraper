I'm livid again
Damn livid again
Believe it or not
Don't like it a lot

It's breaking my heart
This ache in my heart
Oh such is life
Oh rhythm of life

This rhythm of life
This trouble and strife
Is saying to me
It's how it should be

I'm trying again
I'm flying again
Oh such is life
Oh rhythm of life

No sweat, do I get
Not anymore
