(rossi / bown)

I saw this picture in a magazine
With it's gold plated grovers
Such a clean machine
So I, I did my home work
And I worked like hell
As the brown eyed handsome man said
You never can tell

I got that blues and rhythm
Good enough to eat
Sound and vision
Hit me with the backbeat

Blues and rhythm
Good enough to eat
Sound and vision
Hit me with the backbeat
Blues and rhythm
Something for my soul
My decision
Give me rock and give me roll

I started gigging in my early teens
Sewed the red leather patches
On my filthy jeans
Got my first fender tele
Got my marshall stack
Big head knock 'em dead
I know where it's at

I got that blues and rhythm
Good enough to eat
Sound and vision
Hit me with the backbeat
Blues and rhythm
Something for my soul
My decision
Give me rock and give me roll

Don't anybody listen anymore
I can still hear them banging
On my bedroom door
Is it too late to tell them?
Will they understand?
Calm down, come on round
And listen to the band

We got the blues and rhythm
Good enough to eat
Sound and vision
Hit me with the backbeat
Blues and rhythm
Something for my soul
My decision
Give me rock and give me roll

Jailhouse rocker
Make you tap your feet
Classic shocker
Listen to the backbeat

I got that blues and rhythm
I got that blues and rhythm
I got that blues and rhythm
We got that blues and rhythm
