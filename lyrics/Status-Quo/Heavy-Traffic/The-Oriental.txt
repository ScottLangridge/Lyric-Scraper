(edwards / rossi)

Her name was mia
From north korea
I said come over
Bring your land rover
I don't like sushi
She said that suits me
I take a shower
On every hour

Oh the oriental
Very very special
If you ever get some
You want another one and another one
The oriental
Very very gentle
I got one for a cousin
Can you send me a dozen?

Her name was mae wong
She came from hong kong
She was a raver
Of eastern flavour
I said I love you
She said I'd love to
Go down to texas
Must have one lexus

Oh the oriental
So very very special
If you ever get some
You want another one and another one
The oriental
Very very gentle
I like it spicy
That'll do me nicely

I'm gonna cross the water
Take a plane to tokyo
And find a little geisha
I love to see them go
And carry on to china, asia minor and some more
Then finish with a sling in singapore

Oh the oriental
Very very special
If you ever get some
You want another one and another one
The oriental
Very very gentle
I got one for a cousin
Can you send me a dozen?

Oh the oriental
Will drive you mental
I really gotta get one
And then another one and another one
Oh the oriental
Can you get them on a rental
Don't send me a russian
Ain't no discussion
Got to be an oriental
