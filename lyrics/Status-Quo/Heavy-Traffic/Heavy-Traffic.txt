( rossi / young / edwards)

Everybody's been a long time talking
Ain't nobody said a word that's true
Ain't it time to stop this crap type talking
Won't you tell us what you're gonna do

Tell you what why don't we break this pattern
Tell you what why don't we do some do
All together we can make it happen
Untogether and we won't get through

Wanna drive yeh drive
I wanna drive but i can't get no-where
Heavy traffic all over this town
I wanna drive yeh drive
I wanna drive i gotta get somewhere
Heavy traffic is bringing me down

Every time i see the red light burning
Don't it always make the air turn blue
But until we see the red light turning
There ain't nothing anyone can do

We all dream about an open highway
Making dreams is all that we can do
We'd be moving on if i had my way
Nothing can stop me getting back to you

Wanna drive yeh drive
I wanna drive but i can't get no-where
Heavy traffic all over this town
I wanna drive yeh drive
I wanna drive i gotta get somewhere
Heavy traffic coming into this town

I wanna drive yeh drive
I wanna drive but i can't get no-where
Heavy traffic all over this town
I wanna drive yeh drive
I wanna drive i gotta get somewhere
Heavy traffic is bringing me down
Heavy traffic all over this town

Heavy traffic all over this town

Heavy traffic coming into this town

Heavy traffic
