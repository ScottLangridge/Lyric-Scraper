(rossi / young)

Big life doing it all
Lookin after number one is the call
What's life doing for you
Shouldn't we be asking what we can do
That's life we give and we take
It's how it should be not I want it now
Won't someone please show me how

We can get to it
Place our bet do it
We can get to it now

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Tell it to your brother

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
If money don't matter
Tell me why we bother

No time I don't understand
Why won't everybody do what they can
This time running away isn't gonna make it better today
Next time making your day isn't gonna be so easy to say
Won't someone show me the way

We can get to it
Place our bet do it
We can get to it now

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Tell it to your brother

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
If money don't matter
Tell me why we bother

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Tell it to your brother

Oh oh money don't matter
Money don't matter
If money don't matter
Tell me why we bother

It makes me mad
And sometimes sad
It makes me think that what has been done so far
Makes no difference at all

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Tell it to your brother

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
If money don't matter
Tell me why we bother

Oh oh money don't matter
Money don't matter
Money don't matter
Tell it to your brother

Money don't matter
Money don't matter
If money don't matter
Tell me why we bother
