(Lancaster)

I'm moving on, I don't know where
But, I've just gotta get me away, from here
So long gone, I'm lost in time
Looking for an answer, waiting for a sign

Stones in my head, stones in my head
I don't know how to break stones in my head

I'm reaching out, I don't feel a thing
The gloves, that I'm wearing are made of my skin
No-one knows what I'm tryin' to hide
But when I start breaking you'll see through my eyes

Stones in my head, stones in my head
I'm trying hard to break stones in my head

It's cold out here, still I'm feeling fine
Cause no one's gonna ask me to come on inside
I don't wanna know but I guess I do
Cause maybe these stones are made out of you

Stones in my head, stones in my head
I really wanna break stones in my head

I'm moving on, I don't know where
But, I've just gotta get me away, from here
So long gone, I'm lost in time
Looking for an answer, waiting for a sign

Stones in my head, stones in my head
I don't know how to break stones in my head
Stones in my head, stones in my head
I really want to break stones in my head
