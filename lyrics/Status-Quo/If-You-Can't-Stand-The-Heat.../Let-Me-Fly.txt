( Rossi / Frost )

I've been so lonely
I can't find any way
So long since I lost my way
I've got a feeling
You're gonna run away anyday
Why does it always seem to be me?

So let me fly
Let me fly like a bird in the sky
Let me fly-y-y away
I wanna climb really high
All the time in the sky
Wanna stay up there all day
So let me fly
Let me fly like a bird in the sky
Let me fly-y-y
Getting away
So after today
Let me fly, fly, fly away

You say you're all right
You don't care anyway
I'm listening, you're trying to say
You think I'm crazy
You're thinking you got everything right
But you're fooling no-one else but yourself

So let me fly
Let me fly like a bird in the sky
Let me fly-y-y away
I wanna climb really high
All the time in the sky
Wanna stay up there all day
So let me fly
Let me fly like a bird in the sky
Let me fly-y-y
Getting away
So after today
Let me fly, fly, fly away

If you get lonely
You can't get along by yourself
If you're finding
You're needing me
Don't wait forever
For me to come a-following you
I'll wait here, you come back by yourself

And we can fly
We can fly like a bird in the sky
We can fly-y-y away
And we can climb really high
All the time in the sky
Gonna stay up there all day
Oh let me fly
Let me fly like a bird in the sky
Let me fly-y-y, getting away
So after today
Let me fly, fly, fly away
