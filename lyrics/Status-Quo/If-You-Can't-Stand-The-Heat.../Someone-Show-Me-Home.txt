(Rossi / Frost)

Down by the side of the hotel all-nighter
Is your old grey door
Men gather round with the fear that a lawman
Will come to clean up the floor
Ones a week it all begins
10: 15 for sure

Smoke fills the room, they arrive in a hurry
Bring the tears to my eyes

Someone show me outta here
Someone show me home
Someone show me, I can't stay
To see you act that way

Out on the street people moving in closer
I take the lift nineteen floors
Right to the top to the edge set for falling
I look down to see you there

Someone show me outta here
Someone show me home
Someone show me, I can't stay
To see you act that way

Someone show me outta here
Someone show me home
Someone show me, I can't stay
To see you act that way
