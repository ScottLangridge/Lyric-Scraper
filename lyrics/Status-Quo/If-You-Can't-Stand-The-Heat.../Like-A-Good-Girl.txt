( Rossi / Young )

As I looked across
To where she was before
I didn't have long
To wait around here anymore

We went to a place
That I hadn't seen before
She worked me over
Then she went away

She looked to me like a good girl
I played along like a fool
I paid a lot just to find out
She's no exeption to the rule

As I carried on
Looking here and there
I couldn't believe
She worked it out
And it worked on me

I guessed early on
But it didn't click inside
She knew my weakness
And she knew my name

She looked to me like a good girl
I played along like a fool
I paid a lot just to find out
She's no exeption to the rule

As I carried on
Looking here and there
I couldn't believe
She worked it out
And it worked on me

We went to a place
That I hadn't seen before
She worked me over
Then she went away

She looked to me like a good girl
I played along like a fool
I paid a lot just to find out
She's no exeption to the rule
