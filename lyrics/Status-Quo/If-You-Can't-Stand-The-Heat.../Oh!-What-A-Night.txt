( Parfitt / Bown )

Walking the tightrope
And losing my pole
I hang on by my teeth
One of those nights
It didn't feel too right
Gonna cry myself to sleep

Oh! What a night
Oh! What a flight it was
Oh! Oh! What a night

No telephone news
And I'm missing you
I can't afford to phone
There's a thousand people
Using my room
But I never felt so alone

Oh! What a night
Oh! What a flight it was
Oh! Oh! What a night

I picture your face
I keep on hearing your voice
I'm dying in the sheets
I daren't think too much
So I drink too much
I still can't get to sleep

Oh! What a night
Oh! What a flight it was
Oh! Oh! What a night
