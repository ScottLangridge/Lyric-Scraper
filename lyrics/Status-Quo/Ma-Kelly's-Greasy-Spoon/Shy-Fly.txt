"Come let me take you", said tiger to the fly
"You'll never make me", said fly, I'm rather shy
"I'm gonna get you", said tiger with a glare
His eyes were a shining, but fly she was aware

Shy fly keep on smiling, yes, keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, gonna keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, you're gonna keep on smiling every day

Miss fly and tiger turn each other on
But teasing and back biting makes love an' much more fun
Fly gets him together and tiger thinks he's won
But fly, she keeps on smiling, he's not the only one

Shy fly keep on smiling and keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, well you keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, gonna keep on smiling every day

Shy fly keep on smiling, gonna keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, you're gonna keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, keep on smiling every day
Shy fly keep on smiling, gonna keep on smiling every day
