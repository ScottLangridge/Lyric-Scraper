Well, I spent my money on the spinning wheel last night
Well, I spent my money on the spinning wheel last night
Well, a red twenty-seven didn't do me right

Well, I went in smiling but I came out feeling down
Well, I went in smiling but I came out feeling down
Well, now that I'm a poor man, I got no friends around

I went high on that lonesome, high on that lonesome hill
I went high on that lonesome, high on that lonesome hill
I need a whole lotta money so I can pay my bills

Well, the spinning wheel blues have made me pack up my bags and go
Well, the spinning wheel blues have made me pack up my bags and go
I had to leave my home town, they don't want me no more
