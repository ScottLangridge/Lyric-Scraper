(Parfitt / Bown / Young)

Oh no I took your number down
Now I can't find it and I'm back in town
Tonight tonight
I can't believe where the hell it's gone
And looking for a lover won't bee too much fun
Tonight tonight

I'm standing in line again
Waisting my time
I know I'd feel fine again
With you on the line
With you on the line

And I'm falling in falling out and
Still don't know what it's all about
I'm falling in falling out
I'm creeping in but I'm crawling out again
Falling in falling out
I'm giving up so I'm calling out to you

I bet you're thinking you where just a game
I bet you bet I can recall your name
Tonight tonight
How can I tell you if I can't get through
How can I make it if I'm not with you
Tonight tonight

I'm standing in line again
Waisting my time
I know I'd feel fine again
With you on the line
With you on the line

And I'm falling in falling out and
Still don't know what it's all about
I'm falling in falling out
I'm creeping in but I'm crawling out again
Falling in falling out
I'm giving up so I'm calling out to you

And I'm falling in falling out and
Still don't know what it's all about
I'm falling in falling out
I'm creeping in but I'm crawling out again
Falling in falling out
I'm giving up so I'm calling out to you

And I'm falling in falling out and
Still don't know what it's all about
I'm falling in falling out
I'm creeping in but I'm crawling out again
Falling in falling out
I'm giving up so I'm calling out to you

And I'm falling in..
