(Supa)

I see you every day
Walking down the avenue
I'd like to get to know you
But all I do is smile at you
Oh baby when it comes to talking
My tongue get so thight
This sidewalk love affair
Has got me high as a kite
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like

Well I'm a slow walker
But girl I'd race a mile for you
Just to get back in time
For my peek-a-boo rendezvous
Well baby maby it's the way
You wear you're blue jeans so tight
I can't put my finger
On what you're doing right
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like

Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like

Well I'm standing on a corner
Smiling by a telephone
I'd like to check you over
Get to know you with a fine tooth comb
Oh baby when I get home, I turn out the light
And then you come a strolling through
My dreams every night
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like
Yeah yeah, there's something 'bout you baby I like
