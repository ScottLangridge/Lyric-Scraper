(Lancaster)

You're climbing mountains in the sky
You're always looking for another high
You're looking so far ahead
You're looking away
I'm taking you in
You're taking me on
Your smiling face
Never lets you down
Where everyone who calls you a friend
Remebers your name
And everyone who called you a friend
Will never again

I'm taking a walk in your heart
I'm feeling my way through the dark
I'm taking a walk in your heart
I'm taking a walk in your heart

I've known the mountain ladies well
They live a never-ending fairytale
Where walking through another heart
Is all in a day
They treat me well
They treat me nice
They think that I'm gonna pay the price
So now I'm gonna put you straight
You're playing my game

I'm taking a walk in your heart
I'm feeling my way through the dark
Oh, I'm taking a walk in your heart
I'm taking a walk in your heart

There's never been a better reason
At any time before
Cause everything that we've been feeling
Is now an open door
And as the snow is falling
The mountains start to call
But do I feel you walking in my heart?

I'm taking a walk in your heart
I'm feeling my way through the dark
And I'm taking a walk in your heart
Yeah, I'm taking a walk in your heart
Oh, I'm feeling my way through the dark
Yeah I'm taking a walk in your heart
