(Rossi / Frost)

The world is in a mess
And finished more or less
It doesn't really matter
And it's maybe too late to change it
It's never too late to change it

Did you take a look
Any sort of look
I'm sure you would remember
cause it wouldn't need much explaining
cause it's never too late to change it

The world is in a mess
And finished more or less
It doesn't really matter
And it's maybe too late to change it
It's never too late to change it
It's never too late for changing
Never too late for changing

Now this old sea-dog's gonna get away across the water
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye
But I don't think God thought we'd get out of order
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye

But now it's getting late
Too late to hesitate
I can't wait any longer
So there's no use in you complaining
cause it's never too late for changing

Now did you take a look
Any sort of look
I'm sure you would remember
cause it wouldn't need much explaining
cause it's never too late to change it

I've told you once or twice
It could be paradise
So listen when I'm talking to you
It shouldn't take much expalining
The world is gonna need some changes
Never too late to change it
Never too late for changing
Never too late to change it
Never too late for changing

Now this old sea-dog's gonna get away across the water
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye
But I don't think God thought we'd get out of order
This old sea-dog is waving you bye-bye
