Charter me something, even a bike
Get me away from here
Buy me some transport and spend what you like
Just get me away from here
Something to take me away
Take me away
I'm shaking, breaking
Get me outta here

Build me a coffin and measure me now
Or get me away from here
I know I'm not ready to end it somehow
Get me away from here
Something to take me away
Take me away
I'm shaking, breaking
Get me outta here

Take me away, take me away
I'm shaking, breaking
Get me outta here

A mental disorder, a physical wreck
Get me away from here
The glamorous life is a pain in the neck
Get me away from here
Take me away, take me away
I'm shaking, breaking
Get me outta here
