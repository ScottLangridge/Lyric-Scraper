(Rossi / Frost)

She left me cold and hungry by the riverside
She left me so downhearted there and I really cried
About mistakes I'd made and it's a crying shame
I can't believ the way they start all over again

She left me cold and hungry by the riverside
Without a word or a note, so I couldn't find
A reason for to stay where I wanted to stay
There didn't seem to me to be anyway

I got away to the city from the riverside
And it was oh, such a pity cause I really tried
It didn't make me feel how I wanted to feel
I turned around to be where I wanted to be

I got away to the city from the riverside
And it was all nitty gritty there, however I tried
I didn't wait to feel how I knew I would feel
I had to turn around, cause I wouldn't be found

Don't blame me or point your finger at me
I'm not blind and I see, don't point your finger at me
Don't you do it, don't you do it to me
Don't point your finger my way
Don't put the blame all my way

She found me so light-hearted by the riverside
She didn't cry or try and I didn't mind
Cause I just had to stay wher I wanted to stay
And the mistakes I made, I made them anyway

She left me cold and hungry by the riverside
And it was oh, such a pity cause I really tried
It didn't make me feel how I wanted to feel
I turned around to be where I wanted to be

Don't blame me or point your finger at me
I'm not blind and I see, don't point your finger at me
Don't you do it, don't you do it to me
Don't point your finger my way
Don't put the blame all my way

She left me cold and hungry by the riverside
And it was oh, such a pity cause I really tried
It didn't make me feel how I wanted to feel
I turned around to be where I wanted to be
She left me cold and hungry by the riverside

Riverside, riverside, riverside
Riverside, riverside, riverside
Riverside, riverside, riverside
Riverside, riverside, riverside
Riverside, riverside, riverside
Riverside...........
