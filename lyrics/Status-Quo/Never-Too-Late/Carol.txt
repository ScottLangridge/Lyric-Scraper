Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Well, come in to my machine, so we can cruse on out
I know a swingin' little joint where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back off the highway not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am
Cause ev'ry time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Well, if you wanna hear some music like the boys are playin'
Hold tight catch your foot, don't let him carry it away
Don't let the heat overcome you, when they play so loud
Oh, don't the music intrigue you, when they get a crowd
If you can't dance, I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby 'cause you dance so good

Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
Oh, Carol don't...
