Sat by a river, wasting my time
I looked at the water and it gave me a sign
I made connection, my reflection
Was calling me back to rock and roll

It was moving, moving along
I looked a little [Incomprehensible] and I thought of a song
And my reaction was satisfaction
Calling me back to rock and roll

Calling, calling me back
I saw it in the water and I'm hitting the track
Nothing to pack, polish my act, Lord
I'm gonna play some rock and roll

I was looking, looking ahead
Staying up instead of falling back into bed
Fuel injected, I've been elected
He's calling me back to rock and roll

Calling, calling me back
I saw it in the water and I'm hitting the track
Nothing to pack, polish my act, Lord
I'm gonna play some rock and roll

"It must be something, something", he said
That's changing my mind and adjusting my head
A new direction, a resurrection
Calling me back to rock and roll

Calling, calling me back
I saw it in the water and I'm hitting the track
Nothing to pack, polish my act, Lord
I'm gonna play some rock and roll

Calling me back, calling me back
Calling me back, calling me back

Rock and roll, rock and roll
(Calling me back, calling me back)
Rock and roll
(Calling me back, calling me back)

Rock and roll, rock and roll
(Calling me back, calling me back)
Rock and roll
(Calling me back, calling me back)

Rock and roll, rock and roll
(Calling me back, calling me back)
Rock and roll
(Calling me back, calling me back)
