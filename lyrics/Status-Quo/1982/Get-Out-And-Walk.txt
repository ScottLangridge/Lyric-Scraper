(Parfitt / Bown)

I got
Fat knees
From crawlin so fast
I got
Sore lips
From kissin' your arse
I know
I don't want
Anymore part of you

I got
Brain pain
You make me so mad
I got
Black eyes
From fightin' your dad
I know
I don't want
Anymore part of you

Get out... Get out
Get out and walk
Stop blowing kisses
Across the hall
Don't write me letters
And please don't call
Gimme me a break
Get out and walk

I got
Slipped discs
With you on my back
I got
Ulcers from swallowing crap
I know
I don't want
Anymore part of you

Get out... Get out
Get out and walk
Stop blowing kisses
Across the hall
Don't write me letters
And please don't call
Gimme me a break
Get out and walk

Get out... Get out
Get out and walk
Stop blowing kisses
Across the hall
Don't write me letters
And please don't call
Gimme me a break
Get out and walk
