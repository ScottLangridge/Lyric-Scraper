(Lancaster)

When I'm playing my old guitar
I know what I'm living for
Cause that's all I wanna do
Keep right on rocking you

I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll

Bye Bye Johnny, I'm All Shook Up
Bebopalula, Rock Around The Clock
You may or may not know
But you'll never rock alone

I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do

And I'm a ready teddy ready to rock
And I'm a ready teddy ready to roll
Come on let's shout it out aloud
I love rock and roll

I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do
I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do

I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do
I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll

I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do
I love rock and roll, in my heart and in my soul
I love rocking you, I love rock and roll, yes I do
