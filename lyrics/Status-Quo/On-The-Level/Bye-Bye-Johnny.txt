( Berry )

Well she drew out all her money from the Southern trust
And put her little boy aboard a greyhound bus
Leaving Louisianna for the golden west
Down came the tears from her happiness
Her own little son, named Johnny B. Goode
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode

She remembered making money out from gathering crops
Buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he would play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble she'll be satisfied
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this
When she got to give her son a goodbye kiss

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode

Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for them by the railroad track
Every time they heard a locomotiv roar
They'd be standing, a waiting by the kitchen door

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode

I said Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye
I said Bye Bye Johnny Bye Bye Johnny B. Goode
