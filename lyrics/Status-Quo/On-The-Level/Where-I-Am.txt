Let me know, let me see
What is this thing that is constantly happening to me, yeah
'Cos when you hold me tight, oh how it feels so right
Yeah and I know where I am

If I should cry, let me cry
My tears are crying a lullaby
'Cos when I hold you tight, oh how it feels so right
Yeah and I know where I am

Changes in me, learning to be
Everything that I just silently wanted to see
'Cos when I'm all alone, everything that I own
Lets me know where I am
Give to me what you can
I'll give you all I command
