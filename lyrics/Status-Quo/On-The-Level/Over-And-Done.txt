( Lancaster )

I really didn't wanna break it
You know I'm sorry it's over and done
I really thought we would have made it
But now it's gone
Can you look into my eyes and tell me
That there's nothing wrong
I know you know it's not the same
It's not the same old song
It's over and over and over
I told you
It's over and done

None of us are getting younger
But we all want to be a millionaire
And when you stop to think about it
It seems unfair
But if you never stop to think at all
You'd never be aware
And never understand the meaning
Of the love we shared
I'ts over and over I told you
I'ts over
It's only fair
Oh it's over and over
I told you
I'ts over and done

It's no good trying to make it better
You know it's doesn't feel the right to do
Everything we shared together
Would break in two
Can you hear what I've been trying to say
I wouldn't do you wrong
We've got to get it over now and learn
To carry on
I'ts over and over and over
I told you
It's over and done
I'ts over and over and over
I told you
It's over and done
Oh it's over and over
I told you
It's over and done
