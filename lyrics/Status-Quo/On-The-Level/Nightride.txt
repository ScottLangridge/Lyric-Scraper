( Parfitt / Young )

Dreaming, going on a night ride
Hoping, it's gonna be the right ride
Feeling so well
I'm in tune cant' you tell
That I'm grooving
Can't you tell I'm in tune
And I'm moving so much closer to you

Leaning, hoping for a straight line
Meaning, hoping for the right rhyme
I'm in tune to the room
'Cos my head just went Boom
And I'm moving
Can't you tell I'm in tune
And I'm moving so much closer to you
Can't you tell I'm in tune
And I'm moving so much closer to you

You, you, you, you, you move me
You, you, you, you, you move me
You, you, you, you, you move me
You, you, you, you, you move me

Scheming, thinking of the right place
Beaming, laughing at my own face
We've got a long way to go
'Cos you make like you're so dissaproving
But can't you tell I'm in tune
And I'm moving so much closer to you
Can't you tell I'm in tune
And I'm moving so much closer to you

You, you, you, you, you move me
You, you, you, you, you move me
You, you, you, you, you move me
You, you, you, you, you move me
You......
