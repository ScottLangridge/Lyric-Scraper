(Rossi / Young)

I found her in a nowhere and I lost her
And I found her and I lost her in a way
She told me of a life, of a great life
Of a fun life but a dumb life in a way
We took off to a somewhere, it was fun there
All along there but we left there in a way

I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know just what to do to do

We started talkin easy 'bout the sleazy
And the easy things that people do
I told her of a life, of a strange one
Pre-arranged one that I dreamt of anyway

I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know just what to do to do

I found her in a nowhere, and I lost her
And I found her and I lost her in a way
I told her of a life, of a strange one
Pre-arranged one that I dreamt of anyway

I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know just what to do to do
