Walking alone, a street with no phone
Could I be younger most of the time?
Doing her wrong, taking so long
Should I do all things in my own time?
May I be wiser, yes, than most men will ever be?
May I be younger most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time

May I be wiser, yes, than most men will ever be?
May I be younger most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time
Most of the time, most of the time
