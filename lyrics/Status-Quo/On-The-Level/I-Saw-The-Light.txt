(Rossi / Young)

You made me love you
Now I can't say goodbye
You're way above me
But I'll never know why

And when I turn left
And then you turn right
And you say you're right
And yo're wrong
I know you're wrong

I saw the light in you
Wasn't much that I could do
I saw the light in you
I saw the light

You made me like you
No like you I am
I'm trying to stay me
But I don't know if I can

When I say it's black
And you say it's white
And I say it's black
And you're wrong
I known you're wrong

Keep standing on a platform
Watching all the trains go past
Keep on trying to catch one
But you know they're much to fast
Never seem to make it
But I know the reason why
I need to need to need to
Need to get away
