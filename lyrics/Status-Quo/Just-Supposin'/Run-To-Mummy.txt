Run To Mummy
Song Lyrics
(Rossibown)
She runs to mummy when she comes over funny
And she really isn't bothered at all
She never hurt me really, maybe she's worth it
But it's rapidly becoming a bore
She says I mess around, take her for a ride
She thinks I gotta little bitty hidden on the side
But doesn't everybody have a little bitty hidden on the side?

I know it's silly but there, there isn't really
Any truth in what she's saying at all
I get suspicious of all her loving kisses
Just before she goes a-missing for hours
She's messing me around, giving me a ride
I think she's got a little bitty hidden on the side
Why does ev'rybody keep a little bitty hidden on the side?

Maybe I'm crazy but I, I love my baby
Maybe baby's just a pain in the heart
She runs to mummy when she comes over funny
Screaming, Mummy, it's a-falling apart

Yeah yeah yeah yeah run to mummy run run
He's a-breaking my heart
Run to mummy run run, yeah yeah run to mummy
He's gonna take us apart

She runs to mummy when she comes over funny
And she really isn't bothered at all
She never hurt me really, maybe she's worth it
But it's rapidly becoming a bore
She says I mess around, take her for a ride
She thinks I gotta little bitty hidden on the side
But doesn't everybody have a little bitty hidden on the side?

Maybe I'm crazy but I, I love my baby
Maybe baby's just a pain in the heart
She runs to mummy when she comes over funny
Screaming, Mummy, it's a-falling apart

Yeah yeah yeah yeah run to mummy run run
He's a-breaking my heart
Run to mummy run run, yeah yeah run to mummy
He's gonna take us apart
Fooling with my feelings, messing with m
