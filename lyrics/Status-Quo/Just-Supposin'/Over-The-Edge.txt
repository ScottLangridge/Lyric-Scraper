(Lancaster / Lamb)

I'm shaking all over
From my head to my feet
I thought I was cold but
I've been really feeling the heat
You're turning me on
You're driving me crazy

My temperature's rising
When I'm talking to you
It wouldn't surprise me
If you told me a hundred and two
What's going on?
You're driving me crazy

And I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling, I'm falling' I'm falling
I've never felt like it before
Surely it's against the law
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
You're driving me crazy

You gave me the fever
And the fever is hot
Taking me higher and higher
Right to the top
Don't let it stop
You're driving me crazy

You gotta believe me
Cause I never pretend
You're doing it now
So do it again
And again
Turning me on
Driving me crazy

And I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling, I'm falling' I'm falling
And like I said before
Surely it's against the law
What's going on?
What's going on?
What's going on?
You're driving me crazy

Over the edge, I'm falling
Over the edge, I'm falling

Never felt like it before
Surely it's against the law
What's going on?
What's going on?
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy

I'm shaking all over
From my head to my feet
I thought I was cold but
I'm a-feeling the heat
My temperature's rising
When I'm talking to you
It wouldn't surprise me
It's a-hundred-and-two
You gave me the fever
And the fever is hot
It's taking me higher
Right to the top
You gotta believe me
Cause I never pretend
You're doing it now
So do it again

I'm shaking all over
From my head to my feet
I'm shaking all over
I'm shaking all over
I'm shaking all over
From my head to my feet
I'm shaking all over
I'm shaking all over
I'm shaking all over
From my head to my feet
I'm shaking all over
Shaking all over
