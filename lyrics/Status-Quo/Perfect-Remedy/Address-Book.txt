Throw away your old address book of the guys you used to know
Get all dressed up in your best look, I'll take you to the movie show
You look lovely when you're angry, but I love the way you smile
We could while away the hours, or we could walk another mile

My darling don't you ever change, don't think I'd be quite the same
I thought I was in control, I thought I was in control

If I knew then what I know now of the chances at the time
Didn't know that I'd be missing a chance to lay it on the line
I could have asked you if you needed, or maybe wanted, to get out
But it didn't really matter, we got together anyhow

My darling don't you ever change, don't think I'd be quite the same
I thought I was in control, I thought I was in control

Threw away your old address book, took a while to realise
You'd be better off with someone, what I mean is me and mine
So whatya doing at the weekend? Shall we make it Friday night?
Anywhere you fancy going, and any way with me's all right

My darling don't you ever change, don't think I'd be quite the same
I thought I was in control, I thought I was in control

My darling don't you ever change, don't think I'd be quite the same
I thought I was in control, I thought I was in control
