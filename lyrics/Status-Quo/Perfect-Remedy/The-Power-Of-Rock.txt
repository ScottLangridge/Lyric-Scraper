( Parfitt / Williams / Rossi )

He was a lonely boy
In a broken land
Where people were living and dying
In the name of a higher man
And then one day
Into his hand
The power of rock and roll

She was a hungry girl
For a caring world
And the rules say don't take a step over there
But she carries on
And drawn one day
Into the force by the power of rock and roll

Oh, oh, fighting for love, and singing you
Oh, oh, telling you why, and showing you
Oh oh, gonna be joined by rock and roll

In a working band
He became the man
But the law of the street
Said they could not meet
In any circumstance
But she did not care
They began to share
The power of rock and roll

Oh, oh, fighting for love, and singing you
Oh, oh, telling you why, and showing you
Oh oh, gonna be joined by rock and roll

Well they were learning
Of trouble they stayed ahead
And they were burning
Burning up and seeing red
That the place they loved would fall apart
If you can't show feeling from the heart
And then fighting
Know what they were fighting for
Can everybody
Give and take a little more
Because it's all too easy to forget
That you can fight 'til there ain't no reason left
So everybody, sing

Oh, oh, and singing you
Oh, oh, and showing you
Woh oh oh, and telling you
Woh oh oh

He was a lonely man
She was a hungry girl
Living on different sides
They were praying for a guiding word
And then one day
Into their hands
The power of rock and roll

Oh, oh, and singing you
Oh, oh, and showing you
Woh oh oh, and telling you
Woh oh oh
