(RossiFrost)
Throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her a sign, don't make her laugh
Don't try putting it on
Show her the time is here at last
And only the past is in the past
Don't try bringing it on

If it were you, you wouldn't wait so long
And if you were true you wouldn't carry on
On and on

So, throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her a sign, don't make her laugh
Don't try putting it on
Show her the time is here at last
And only the past is in the past
Don't try bringing it on

'Til there was you I was the only one
'Til there was you she didn't carry on
On and on

Oh, throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her a sign, don't make her laugh
Don't try putting it on
Show her the time is here at last
And only the past is in the past
Don't try bringing it on

I hope you don't mind if I just have to say
Just talking up high, it is the only way
Only way

So, throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her the time is here at last
Throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her the time is here at last
Throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her the time is here at last
Throw her a line, she's sinking fast
Show her the time is here at last
Throw her a line
