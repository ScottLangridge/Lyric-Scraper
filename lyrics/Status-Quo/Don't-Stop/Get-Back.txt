Sweet Loretta Modern though she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her said she had it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back to where you once belonged
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back to where you once belonged
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
