All around my hat
I will wear the green willow
And all around my hat
For a twelve month and a day
And if anyone should ask me
The reason why I'm wearing it
It's all for my true love
Who's far far away

Fare thee well cold winter
And fare thee well cold frost
Nothing have I gained
But my own true love I've lost
I'll sing and I'll be merry
When on occasion I do see
She's a false deluded young girl
Let here go farewell she

And all around my hat
I will wear the green willow
And all around my hat
For a twelve month and a day
And if anyone should ask me
The reason why I'm wearing it
It's all for my true love
Who's far far away

The other night she brought me
A fine diamond ring but,
She thought to have deprived me
Of a far better thing
But I being careful
As lovers ought to be
She's a false deluded young girl
Let her go farewell she

And all around my hat
I will wear the green willow
And all around my hat
For a twelve month and a day
And if anyone should ask me
The reason why I'm wearing it
It's all for my true love
Who's far far away

All around my hat
I will wear the green willow
And all around my hat
For a twelve month and a day
And if anyone should ask me
The reason why I'm wearing it
It's all for my true love
Who's far far away
