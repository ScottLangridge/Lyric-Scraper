(Fogerty)
Left a good job in the city, working for the man every night and day
And I never lost a minute of sleeping worrying 'bout the way things might
have been
Big wheel keep on turning, Proud Mary keep on burning
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river

Been a lot of places in Memphis, pumped a lot of pain down in New
Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city 'til I hitched a ride on the
riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turning, Proud Mary keep on burning
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river

Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river

Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river

If you come down to the river, bet you're gonna find some people who live

You don't have to worry if you don't have no money, people on the river
are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turning, Proud Mary keep on burning
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river

Big wheel keep on turning, Proud Mary she just keeps on burning
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin on the river
