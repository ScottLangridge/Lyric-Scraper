(FeldmanGoldsteinGottehrer)
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow

You're acting funny, spending all my money
You're out there playing your high class games
Sorrow, sorrow

You never do what you know you oughtta
Something tells me you're the Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Aaah, aaah

With your long blonde hair
I didn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair

I tried to fight her but I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow, sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow
Aaah, aaah

With your long blonde hair
I didn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hair
