(Ivan Doroschuk)
We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind
'Cos your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine
Say, we can go wher we want to, places they can never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real world far behind

We can go if we want to, night is young and so was I
And we can dress real neat from our heads to our feet
And surprise them with a victory cry
I said, we can act if we want to, if we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude and totally removed
I can act like an imbecile

We can dance, we can dance, everything is under control
We can dance, we can dance, doing it from pole to pole
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's taking the chance
The safety dance
Woh, safety dance, yeah, the safety dance

We can dance if we want to, we got all your life to find
As long as we have music, never gonna lose it
Everything will work out right
We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind
'Cos your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

We can dance, we can dance, everything is under control
We can dance, we can dance, doing it from pole to pole
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's taking the chance
Safety dance
Oh, safety dance, yeah, safety dance
Safety dance, safety dance
Oh, safety dance, safety dance
