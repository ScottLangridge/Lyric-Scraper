(Macdonald)
I study nuclear science, I love my classes
I got a crazy teacher who wears dark glasses
Things are going great, and they're only getting better
I'm doing all right, getting good grades
The future's so bright I gotta wear shades

I gotta job waiting for my graduation
Fifty thou a year will buy a lotta beer
Things are going great, and they're only getting better
I'm doing all right, getting good grades
The future's so bright I gotta wear shades

I'm heavenly blessed and worldy wise
I'm a peeping-tom techy with x-ray eyes
Things are going great, and they're only getting better
I'm doing all right, getting good grades
The future's so bright I gotta wear shades

Yeah, I'm doing all right, getting good grades
The future's so bright I gotta wear shades
I'm doing all right, getting good grades
The future's so bright I gotta wear shades
Yeah I'm doing all right, getting good grades
The future's so bright I gotta wear shades
I gotta wear shades, I gotta wear shades
Gotta wear shades, got to wear shades
I'm heavenly blessed and worldy wise
I'm a peeping tom techy with x-ray eyes.....
