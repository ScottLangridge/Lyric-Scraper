Something's going on in my head Something you're saying now
Disturbing the way I feel
I don't know what you're about
I only know the way that I feel
I'm holding it here in my mind
So please don't be unkind
Don't talk just let me unwind
'Cos something's going on in my head Yeah, something's going on in my head
And I'm not quite sure what you said

I can see the rain outside
It's falling on everything
It's making such a noise out there
But my ears they don't hear a thing
I'm trying to get it over to you
Just what I want you to do
Don't know what I'm going through
'Cos something's going on in my head
Yeah, something's going on in my head
And I'm not quite sure what you said

Something you're saying now
Disturbing the way I feel
I don't know what you're about
I only know the way I feel
I'm holding it here in my mind
So please don't be unkind
Don't talk just let me unwind
'Cos something's going on in my head Yeah, something's going on in my head
And I'm not quite sure what you said
