I don't need you mama, I just need your love
I'm here for loving so take it while I'm good enough
I just need your love

Seems I've waited longer than I've ever done
My mind is getting evil and my body's numb
Woman can I come?
Woman can I come to you?
'Cos I need your love
Yes I need your love

I don't need you mama, I just need your love
I'm here for loving so take it while I'm good enough
I just need your love

Seems I've waited longer than I've ever done
My mind is getting evil and my body's numb
Woman can I come?
Woman can I come to you?
'Cos I need your love
Yes I need your love
