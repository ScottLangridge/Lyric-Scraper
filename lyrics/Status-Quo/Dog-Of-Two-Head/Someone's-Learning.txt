All around an open fire, no-one's got a name
The flame is getting higher and higher, nothing's quite the same
But someone's learning, the fire keeps burning
Someone's learning, the fire keeps burning

In the night three children died, now, all were under five
That's alright, God's on our side, now, our religious right
And someone's learning, someone's learning
The world keeps turning, and someone's learning

Someone made a big mistake, now, that will never do
Show him what we think about it, read it in the news
And someone's learning, someone's learning
The world keeps turning, and someone's learning
