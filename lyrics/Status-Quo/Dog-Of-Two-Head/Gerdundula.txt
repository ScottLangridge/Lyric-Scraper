(Manston / James)

Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
Seems that I'm the one love
The one love left behind

I've searched it just won't come my way
I've searched it just won't come my way
It's love that I want now
So what more can I say

Women seem to pass me by
Women seem to pass me by
If I could find the reason
I'd know the answer why

Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
Seems that I'm the one love
The one love left behind
