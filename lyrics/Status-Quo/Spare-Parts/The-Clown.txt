Now don't you feel sorry, oh no, for me now
There's no need to worry about a clown
She played it cool made me a fool
Now all over town they call me the clown

And I really thought she loved me, but now, I know
And I still can't believe, it just goes to show
She played it cool made me a fool
Now all over town they call me the clown

I'm a clown, and they're laughing
I'm a clown, I got nothing
I'm a clown, and they're laughing at me
I'm a clown, and they're laughing
I'm a clown, I've got nothing
I'm a clown, and they're laughing at me

Now don't you feel sorry, oh no, for me now
There's no need to worry about a clown
She played it cool made me a fool
Now all over town they call me the clown

I'm a clown, and they're laughing
I'm a clown, I got nothing
I'm a clown, and they're laughing at me
I'm a clown, and they're laughing
I'm a clown, I've got nothing
I'm a clown, and they're laughing at me

I'm a clown, and they're laughing
I'm a clown, I got nothing.....
