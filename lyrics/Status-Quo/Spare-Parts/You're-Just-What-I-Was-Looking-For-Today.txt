Hey little woman
You're just what I was looking for today
I needed someone
And you're just what I was looking for today

Good things seem to happen to you
When you just happen to run along livin' right
But if you wait too long you know that
When you turn around you find you have lost them in life

The sun may have to shine
But the visions in my eyes were painted gray
Now listen to the lightning
You're just what I was looking for today

We could drift away together
Where you and I could be alone

Nothing that is real applies
Need for nothing [Incomprehensible]
We could drift away
Undo the world of lines

Hey little woman
You just what I was looking for
