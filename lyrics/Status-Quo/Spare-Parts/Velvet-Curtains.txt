Velvet curtains draw the show to a close
Our scene is over and the whole world knows
Velvet curtains shut the light from my mind
I leave the stage, put my memories behind

How it started with a passing word
How you answered and I liked what I heard
Wasn't long before we fell in love
And we thought we'd never part

Velvet curtains draw the show to a close
Our scene is over and the whole world knows
Velvet curtains shut the light from my mind
I leave the stage, put my memories behind

How I started to depend on you
How you tried to be dependable too
But you found it hard to change your ways
And you merely broke my heart

Pretty soon I knew it had to end
Still I fool myself and try to pretend
But what's the good if there's another guy
And he's playing the leading part?

Velvet curtains draw the show to a close
Our scene is over and the whole world knows
Velvet curtains shut the light from my mind
I leave the stage, put my memories behind

Velvet curtains draw the show to a close
Our scene is over and the whole world knows....
