Hey Mr. Mind Detector
Use your power to find what's going on
Hey Mr. Mind Detetctor
Gonna blow my mind before too long
Gotta find a way to learn infinity
Gotta find a way to make you save my sanity

Look into my mind an you will
Find a world of magic mystical
Images of endless beauty
Hypnotising, motorising shadows
Gotta find a way to let her know I'm here
Gotta find a way to make her want to have me near

Hey Mr. Mind Detector

Hey Mr. Mind Detetctor
Gonna blow my mind before too long
Gotta find a way to learn infinity
Gotta find a way to make you save my sanity
