(Parfitt)

How can I see what I'm leaving for
How can I give what I gave before
How can you tell me that you want me to stay
How can I stay when I'm trying to say
That I can live without the rain
Yes I can live without the rain

How can I feel what I'm trying to feel
How can move when I'm heel to heel
You're always shouting about the doubt in my eye
But I can't answer cause my eyes are so dry
Now I can live without the rain
Yes I can live without the rain

I can live without the rain
That's falling on my head
Rain that's falling on my head

Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling
Rain that's falling on my head

I started thinking back to you know when
I'd like to send a line but then again
How can I write you when there ain't no light
I'm feeling thight tonight and that's alright
Now I can live without the rain
Yes I can live without the rain
