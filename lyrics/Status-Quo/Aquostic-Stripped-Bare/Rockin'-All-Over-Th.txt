(Fogerty)

Oh here we are and here we are and here we go
All aboard and we're hittin' the road
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

Well gidy up gidy up and get away
We're goin' crazy and we're goin' today
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-li-like it, li-li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

We're gonna tell your mama what you're gonna do
So come on out with your dancing shoes
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-li-like it, li-li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-li-like it, li-li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-li-like it, li-li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-li-like it, li-li-li-li
Here we go
Rockin' all over the world
