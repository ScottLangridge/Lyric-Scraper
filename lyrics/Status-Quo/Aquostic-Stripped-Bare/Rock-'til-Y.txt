( Bown )

Don't hang up your shoes
Just kick out the blues
And rock 'til you drop tonight

All we do
Depends upon you
So rock 'til you drop tonight

We hit all the high spots
The star studded bills and the mirror balls
Half of the time we were playing a game
Half of the time I could hardly remember my name

So stay with us now
And hang in somehow
And rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop

We hit all the high spots
The star studded bills and the movie balls
Half of the time we were playing a game
Half of the time I could hardly remember my name

So stay with us now
And hang in somehow
And rock 'til you drop tonight

All we do
Depends upon you
So rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
Rock 'til you drop tonight
