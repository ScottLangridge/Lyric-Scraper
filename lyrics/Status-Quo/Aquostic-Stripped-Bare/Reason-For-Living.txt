(Rossi / Parfitt)

I felt in need of some loving
So I sat down on a wall
I tried to find a reason for living
But I couldn't find a reason at all
So I owned up to my maker
And I started to say a prayer
I waited for an answer
But there wasn't anybody there

I thought there should have been someone
But I wasn't quite sure who
It finished me to find there was no-one
That I could take my troubles to
So I knelt down by my bedside
And I started to say a prayer
It was when I asked for nothing
I could feel that there was somebody there

I'm looking still, but it's easy
Cause I know which way to go
It doesn't matter how long it takes me
Cause there's someone there to help me who knows
All the things that I am after
All the loving that I want to share
It's so hard but I don't mind
Cause there really is somebody there

I felt in need of some loving
So I sat down on a wall
I tried to find a reason for living
But I couldn't find a reason at all
So I owned up to my maker
And I started to say a prayer
I waited for an answer
But there wasn't anybody there
