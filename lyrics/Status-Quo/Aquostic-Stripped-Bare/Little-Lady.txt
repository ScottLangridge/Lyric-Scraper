( Parfitt )

Well I saw my little lady
Walking down the street
And I asked her Where you going to
Well I saw my little lady
Walking down the street
She said she'd found somebody new
Found myself all alone
Ain't no fun on your own
Now I'm like a rolling stone

So I made another lady
And so many more
Didn't really know wich way to go
So I made another lady
And so many more
But no-one did I get to know
Found myself all alone
Ain't no fun on your own
Now I'm like a rolling stone

Then I saw my little lady
Walking down the street
Didn't know where she was going to
So I told my little lady
Walking down the street
Now you know what I've been going through
Found herself all alone
Ain't no fun on your own
Living like a rolling stone

I was like a rolling
I was like a rolling stone
