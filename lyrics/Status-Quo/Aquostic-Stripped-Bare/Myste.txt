( Parfitt / Young )

I see that look on your face
I see that look on your face
I see that look on your face

The boys know what you're giving
You give the boys such a lot of fun
And by the way that you make a living
You've got the boys all on the run
S.T's showing, you really got me going
Maybe you can give me a price
I wanna try it, yeh I wanna buy it
Tell me would you treat me nice
Oh my legs are shaking
Oh my heart is breaking
I'm just feeling like a boy
Now I just can't slow down
Gotta get in go down
Have my share of pride and joy

Now I've got your name and number
I like to look upon your face
And now you know that I wanna take you
Give me the time you can name the place
Call me honey, you can take my money
Maybe we can make a deal
I really mean it, gotta get between it
Do you know the way I feel
Oh I'm feeling kinda
Like I've gotta find
A way to make you understand
Oh I know you're lying
And your love I'm buying
Oh I'm feeling like a man

The boys know what you're giving
You give the boys such a lot of fun
And by the way that you make a living
You've got the boys all on the run
S.T's showing, really got them going
You can even say the price
They'll wanna try it, even wanna buy it
If you really treat them nice
But I'd rather take you
Show that I can make you
Good enough for just one man
Oh I'm feeling kinda
Like I've gotta find
A way to make you understand
