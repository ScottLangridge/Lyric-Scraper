(Rossi / Frost)

When I was a young boy, nothing much mattered to me
You were a girl and a half and you saw yourself a mystery
We got together for a while, I did every thing you wanted me too
Well I tried and you lied, I was left here back in the blue

If your gonna run, are you gonna run today?
Is it because I'm out on the road?
You never had it good, you never had it anyway
More more more making waves

I was always right there when you wanted to play
You were living in a scene from a dream every night and day
And I never found a way to make it better for you
Oh I tried, and I tried, but you left me back in the blue

If your gonna run, are you gonna run today?
Is it because I'm out on the road?
You never had it good, you never had it anyway
More more more making waves

What you gonna do now? Nothing left, nothing to say
Well I must have been a fool to believe in you anyway
When I tried to find a way or something that I could do
You threw it all in my face and you left me back in the blue

If your gonna run, are you gonna run today?
Is it because I'm out on the road?
You never had it good, you never had it anyway
More more more making waves

If your gonna run, are you gonna run today?
Is it because I'm out on the road?
You never had it good, you never had it anyway
More more more making waves
