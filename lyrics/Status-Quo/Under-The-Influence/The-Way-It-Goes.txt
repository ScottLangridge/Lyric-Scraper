( Rossi / Frost )

Living isn't easy, feeling bright and breezy,
Everybody has to try
Seeing and believing, never show the reason why
Even when we grow up, and the body slow up, no no no
We think again but do we understand?

That's the way it goes
Everybody knows
That you can't survive if you ain't got drive
Those velvet wings can't help you fly
Those velvet wings won't always help you to get by
But you must carry on

People try and tell you anything they want to,
Saying that it's only fun
When they got you looking down the barrel of a gun
Never if we know it are we gonna blow it, no no no
We think again and so we understand

That's the way it goes
Everybody knows
That you can't survive if you ain't got drive
Those velvet wings can't help you fly
Those velvet wings won't always help you to get by
But you must carry on

I haven't told any secrets
I swore not to tell any lies
Something inside me is saying
That's the way it goes
That's the way it goes

Those velvet wings can't help you fly
Those velvet wings won't always help you to get by
But you must carry on

That's the way it goes
Everybody knows
That you can't survive if you ain't got drive
Those velvet wings can't help you fly
Those velvet wings won't always help you to get by
But you must carry on

Those velvet wings can't help you fly
Those velvet wings won't always help you to get by
But you must carry on
