( Bown / Edwards )

Monday morning, beautiful sunshine
Don't wanna go to work now
Guess I won't be missed this one time
Nobodies getting hurt now
Telephone call on the red card hotline
I'm never gonna learn how

We go round and round and round and round and over again
We turn inside out and upside down but in the end
What goes round and round and round will come together again

I dream all day, she tells me I'm lazy
I think she better go now
She don't understand, she's an airhead baby
I'm a legend in my own town
On the cards it's a definite maybe
There's gonna be a showdown

And we go round and round and round and round and over again
We turn inside out and upside down but in the end
What goes round and round and round will come together again

We go round and round and round and round and over again

Sometimes cool, sometimes crazy
I never have a bad day
I stay clear when everything's hazy
I never have a mad day
Do my best, nothing can change me
I gotta do it my way.

'cos we go round and round and round and round and over again
We turn inside out and upside down but in the end
What goes round and round and round will come together again

We go round and round and round and round
