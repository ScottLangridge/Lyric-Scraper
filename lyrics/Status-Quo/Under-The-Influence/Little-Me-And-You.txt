( Bown )

I've seen a place in the valley
Pinewood floor and roses round the door
I'll take you there
If you'll have me
Maybe we could make it work

We'll hide away from the bad guys
Who say your's true, ain't good enough for you
I mix a mean tequila sunrise
We could have a real good time

I got a heart full of big love
I got a head full of good thoughts
I got a belly full of everybody
Telling me what to do
They better keep their noses clean
I say they'd better not come between
Little me and you,me and you
We'll take a dive undercover
We'll get by, just you and I
We'll take a drink then another
And twist the night away

I got a heart full of big love
I got a head full of good thoughts
I got a belly full of everybody
Telling me what to do
They better keep their noses clean
I say they'd better not come between
Little me and you, me and you

Little me and you well we go back
Back to the school yard, that's a fact
The bestest times I ever had
Just you and me and a sherbet dab
They better keep their noses clean
I say they'd better not come between
Little me and you, me and you

Me and you now we go back
Back to the school yard, that's a fact
The bestest times I ever known
You let me steal a kiss and then I walk you home

I got a heart full of big love
I got a head full of good thoughts
I got a belly full of everybody
Telling me what to do
They better keep their noses clean
I say they'd better not come between
Little me and you
