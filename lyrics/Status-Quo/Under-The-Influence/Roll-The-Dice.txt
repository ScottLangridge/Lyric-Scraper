( Rossi / Frost )

I walk along an empty street
I love the sounding of my feet
It makes me feel so good and though
There's nobody else around, not a soul

I'm quite content to take a seat
The council put there in the street
And watch the nothing going on
Can it really be so wrong all along
To wanna have the best of both worlds
A winner once again

Roll roll roll
Roll the dice
Pay pay pay
Pay the price
Roll roll roll
Gimme a roll
I wanna roll
Roll the dice

I made a beeline for a bar
That I had noticed just before
I didn't bother going in
And then the feeling came again from within
To wanna have the best of both worlds
A winner once again

Roll roll roll
Roll the dice
Pay pay pay
Pay the price
Roll roll roll
Gimme a roll
I wanna roll
Roll the dice

Let it shine on me
Let it shine
