( Petty / Hardin )

I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I'm gonna love you night and day
Love is love, and not fade away
Love is love, and not fade away

My loves bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show it but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
For you to know just how I feel
And not fade away, not fade away
Not fade away

My loves bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show it but you drive me back
Love to last more than one day
Love is love and not fade away
Said love is love and not fade away

Not Fade Away

I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
Love is love, and not fade away
Love is love, and not fade away

Not Fade Away
It won't fade away
