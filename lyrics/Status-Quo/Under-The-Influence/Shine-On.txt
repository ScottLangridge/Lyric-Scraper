(Parfitt / Edwards)

The evening sun went down
I tried to rise and shine
I didn't feel so good
I prayed for extra time

And I could see a light
Breaking through the night
Shining down on me

I had to make a stand
To find myself again
cause I was on my knees
And I was near the end

And then I saw a light
Breaking through the night
Shining down on me
Let it shine on me
Let it shine on me
Let it shine on me

Shine on, Shine on, Shine on, Shine on

I opened up my eyes
To see the morning sun
And now the road is clear
And I am free to run
Yeah I can see the light
It's burning so bright
Shining down on me
Shining down on me

And it was the light
That took me through the night
Shining down on me
Shining down on me
