I can't afford a ticket
On an old Dakota airplane
Gotta jump a ride
On a cattle trucking slowtrain
Guess it doesn't matter
As long as I can get my head down in the sun.

I wrote a rocking song
Gonna sing it at the station
Finish all the words
When I reach my destination
Guess it doesn't matter
As long as I can get my head down in the sun.

Hey Mama, please now don't you fret none
Don't worry but please don't you forget
Hey Mama, please don't get upset none
Gotta leave and find me something better
Hey Mama, things are gonna work out fine now
Believe me need for you to write
Hey Mama, things are gonna work out fine now
I've got a friend said that she'd invite me.

I came here in the morning
And I crept out in the middle of the night
I gave nobody warning I was leaving
And I felt it was right
Now I'm off again
And it sure is feeling alright.

Got a feeling that I'm living
With a ticket and I won't jump a ride
It's no good you believing
That my leaving was a-wrong, it was right
Now I'm off again
And it sure is feeling alright.
