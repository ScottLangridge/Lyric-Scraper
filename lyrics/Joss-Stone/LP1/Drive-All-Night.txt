Just when I thought I put you up
Silly old me, I called too many times
Thought you were about to love me up
Here I am getting all messed up by fucking fireside

CHORUS:
Then you drive all night saying what use is the night, when you can't sleep
Anyway
You might be tired, but the fact to the matter is you're standing right in
Front of my face
You saved me, saved me from hate, it's so close to love
No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

I started to worry, do I smell nice?
Like a fool I left my gum on the side
Than I go and kiss you and the follow up from that was whole bunch of
Nothing

Wondering where you're at

CHORUS

No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before
I'm happy, always grown, at least I can sing a love song
There's no reason to believe the life outside the (?)
I'm glad that I was wrong, I can see that we're high
I can see that we're feeling

CHORUS
