What happened to this morning when I
I woke up hung over?
What happened to the people walking
Hand in hand, yeah
Let's treat this day like a newborn baby
Wants to be looked after
Let's treat this moment like one never felt before

Chorus:
Everybody walk hand in hand
Get hold of your land
Push together, Yeah
Everybody get over hate
You turned up too late
That trick's over

What happened to the story
When the light let go of darkness
What happened to that ray of sunshine
She was fighting strong?
No more delay
No more competing
For a happy ever after
Today we play in one team
Yes there's one team for all

Chorus

We roll on bleeding weak from strong,
Knowing right from wrong
What happened to this morning
When I woke up
And the world was bruised?

See, everybody's taking care of themselves
Not looking out of the widest window
Somehow everybody's taking care of themselves
But not no one else
What happened to this morning
We're stalling our love

Chorus

Everybody walk hand in hand
Grab hold of your land
Push together, yeah
Now everybody get over hate
You turned up too late
That trick's over

What happened to this morning
When we woke up hung over
Like soul ache forever
What happened to the day
When people walked hand in hand together, man
Let's treat this day like a newborn baby
Want to be taken care of
What happened to this morning
We're stalling our love
What happened to that day?
