I never see the clouds
Fall on you
Baby tell me how
Easy what to do
When the sun shines through the rainbow
I know is truth
Baby all my life
I'll wait for you

At the boat yard we'll be waiting
To the costal we'll be waiting
Hoping that the rumors are true
I hope you'll come through
And I'll never lose you

I never see the clouds
Fall on you
Baby tell me how
Easy what to do
When the sun shines through the rainbow
I know is truth
Baby all my life
I'll wait for you

No matter how long I say this
Knowing trusting and praying
I know you'll come through
And I'll never lose you
I never see the clouds
Fall on you
Baby tell me how
Easy what to do
When the sun shines through the rainbow
I know is truth
Baby all my life
I'll wait for you

Will you come through?
Will you be true?
God I miss you
I see your face
In the
I'm never leaving, never leaving

I never see the clouds
Fall on you
Baby tell me how
Easy what to do
When the sun shines through the rainbow
I know the truth
Baby all my life
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
I never see the clouds
Fall on you baby
Baby tell me how
Would you tell me how
I never see the clouds
Fall on you
