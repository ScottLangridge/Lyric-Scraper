Take good care
Don't push the button
Life's so precious when you're
Standing in the firing line

You don't know me
But I see you
Oh so high and mighty
Shooting at some friends of mine

Just take good care
Don't push the button
Life's so precious when you're
Standing in the firing line

Too much blood
Too many tears she'd
Just how much before the madness
Turns us all to dust
Have you had enough?

Just take good care please
Don't push the button
Life's so precious when you're
Standing in the firing line
