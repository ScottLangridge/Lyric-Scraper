Chorus:
I hold my cause close to my chest
I had my heart put to the test
Na na na na, na hell nah
I don't wanna be in love

Living in the dark confused because you moved a mark
I don't know how far you go, is this the start?
Will this episode explode to a lot of love, I just don't know
Is this the door that will never close?
Like it's done before, a thousand times

Chorus

If you asked me this a year ago
To lay down by your side, I'd run a mile
Being close was impossible, had too much to lose
Just the thought of letting go, I'll never know
But you keep pushing on, pushing on

Chorus
In love, I don't wanna be in love
Don't make me baby, don't make me
Don't make me be in love

I think that I've just found me the right one
I can't believe that I'm the last one to know

I hold my cause close to my chest
I had my heart put to the test
Na na na na
Hell no, I don't wanna be
I really don't wanna be in love

Don't make me be, take it back baby
I don't wanna be, I don't need to be in love
Heal me baby, I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna, I can't, I don't need to be
I don't wanna be in love baby
Take it back, take it away from me
Take it away baby, I can't handle it, I don't wanna be

Oh yeah, I can't believe that I am the last one
The last one to know what the hell is going on
I can't believe that I'm the last one to know
Say it ain't so, please, please
