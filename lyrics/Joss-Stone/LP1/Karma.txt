[Joss Stone]
If I was just a little bit stronger, baby
Coulda make it last a little bit longer maybe
Coulda made it on my own
I should have just let you go
I should have been a little bit stronger, baby

If I was just a little bit sweeter, baby
I know, I know, I know I wouldn't be here alone
Thank God I'm a little bit meaner, baby

[Chorus:]
I am what I am, you did what you did
I'm glad I'm not a sinner baby, cause here's a twist
You are what you are, I saw what I saw
Karma's your master, and you're the bitch

[Joss Stone]
You could have tried a little bit harder, baby
You could have been a little smarter baby
I tried not to see when you were on and off for me
You could have tried a little bit harder, baby

[Chorus:]
I am what I am, you did what you did
I'm glad I'm not a sinner baby, cause here's a twist
You are what you are, I saw what I saw
Karma's your master, and you're the bitch

[Bridge:]
Yes, you are, yeaaah!
Now I got a loaded gun now, baby
Gonna love to watch you run like a lady
And cry like a baby just like a did when you have gone

I should have been a little bit stronger
I should have been a little bit harder
I should have been a little bit tougher
I should have been a little bit smarter
I should have been a little bit rougher
I should have been a little bit stronger
I should have been a little bit faster
Away from you baby, away from you, oh

I made it on my own, now the feeling's gone
It's so gone...
