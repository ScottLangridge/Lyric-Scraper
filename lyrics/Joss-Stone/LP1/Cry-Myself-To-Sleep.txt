I could hardly speak
Cause you stood on every word
That I muttered.
I looked at you and lied
With my lips I said that I loved you
While my soul was asking why
Why I'm not surprised
I lost your faith in the truth
And I've turn and lost you
I won't cry myself to sleep no
Stop before it starts
Gonna find myself a pain
And write down my heart

I won't cry myself to sleep no
Don't let it go too far
Put it down on paper
The reasons we're apart

Where it's tough to see
Or even begin to understand a girl like me
I find it hard to say
Anything I'm feeling
So I will concentrate
The hurt I live and breathe in

So I won't
I won't cry myself to sleep no
Stop before it starts
Gonna find myself a pain
And write down my heart
I won't cry myself to sleep no
Don't let it go too far
Put it down on paper
The reasons we're apart

Ohhh yeeaahhh
Is there a good reason?
I won't cry myself to sleep no
Stop before starts
Gonna find myself a pain
Yes I will
I won't cry myself to sleep no
Don't let it go too far
Put it down on paper
I won't

So I'm letting you go
I'm letting you go
Yes I am
I won't, I won't cry myself to sleep
I won't, I won't cry myself to sleep, no
And I
Not no more
See those days are gone, boy
I won't cry myself to sleep, no I won't
Not no more
