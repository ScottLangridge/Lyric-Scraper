The fire in his belly is taking over
He never watches the telly dressed or sober
He really likes a tiff, give him a spliff
And he won't row now
He gets me to the point it's nearly over
But somehow

Somehow I'd like to get to know him
Somebody told me that I shouldn't claim him
Somebody told me that I should let him go
Baby somehow

I really hate to say this
I can't wait 'til he gets older
Then I can assure you we'll be fine
I won't bow out
I know nobody's perfect
With love you gotta earn it
But until then I guess we'll have to scream and shout
Somehow, I'd like to get to know him
Somebody told me that I should claim him
Somebody said I shouldn't let him go
Baby, somehow

But they really don't know
That sometimes I really wanna kill him
I'd die if I wasn't with him
Somebody said I should let him go, oh

Look you're not a Casanova
Well we got people coming over
I couldn't care less about the mess
Just pipe it down
By now you should know it
That I'm a girl who don't give a shit
There comes a point even for me
I got my pride

Somehow, I'd like to get to know him
Somebody told me that I should claim him
Somebody said I shouldn't let him go
Baby, somehow

I really don't know, but, baby, somehow
