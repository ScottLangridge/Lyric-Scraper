You're telling me that you just need some time
Got some things that you need to find
Saying that is you honey isn't me
You can say you don't want me to cry
You can say you're just saying goodbye
And honey I do believe
Now you're telling me you love me
Don't start lying to me now

You can say that you don't wanna fight
You can say that just isn't right
Tell me it's time to move on
You can tell me you're telling the truth
That you don't wanna make me a fool
And baby you know I pay along
Now you're telling me you're sorry
Don't start lying to me now

Got no use for your excuses
Take'em with you when you go
Baby you ain't laid to me before
Don't start lying to me now

You can say that you want to be friends
That you wish that it wasn't the end
