Tonight when the darkness comes
Why don't we treat it like a friend
Then we'll both be glad to see the night
And we'll be hoping
It's never going to end

So don't be afraid of what the night-time may bring
You must understand that you can dream of anything

[Chorus:]
So fall into sleep
Peaceful and deep
And may this journey help you fly
When you can't hold out much longer
Don't you cry
When the darkness is getting stronger
Sleep like a child
Peaceful and deep
And when you lay you down
I pray your soul to keep
Sleep like a child
Peaceful and deep
And I when you lay you down
I pray your soul to keep

You won't be alone
For I will not be denied
Under the darkest of skies
I'm gunna be by your side

[Chorus]

Well I know
I can see it in your eyes
You're tired of fighting everyday
Trying to struggle through the night
Yes I know that it's hard to carry on
So just lay down your heard
And in your dreams you will be strong

Sleep like a child
Peaceful and deep
And when you lay you down
I pray your soul to keep
Oh like a child
Peaceful and deep

Sleep like a child
Peaceful and deep
And I when you lay you down
I pray your soul to keep
