Don't go sending me those three dozen roses
Don't you know that just one rose will do
Don't go trying to put diamonds on my fingers
Don't you know that I'm making money too

Don't go throwing those stones outside my window
You don't gotta be calling three times a day
'Cause if you do then when we get together
I'll be biting my lip 'cause there's nothing else left to say

Haven't you heard absence makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out it's not right

[Chorus:]
Less is more
Back it up slow it down let it breathe
Cause you too much of a good thing can be
Bad
See we don't wanna go out like that
Less is more
Pull it back, hold it down, chill it out
If you want me to still be around
Remember

If you wanna be showing your affection
Don't you know a simple kiss will do
So many beautiful ways for love's expression
But I'm sorry to say your way ain't getting through

Haven't you heard a little space makes the heart grow fonder
Haven't you heard nothing good comes overnight
I'm telling you straight baby, just in case you wonder
It's turning me off, crowding me out it's not right

[Chorus:]

It would be something if I had a chance to be missing you
Too much for taking it's driving me crazy
That's all you do
It needs rearranging
It's so suffocating
That I can't move
You gotta take two steps back
Believe what they say
It's true

[Chorus:]

Gimme a chance to miss you
Boy I don't mean to diss you, but
I tell you I need some space and still you call me up three times a day
You know, baby you crowding me out
Haven't you heard less is more

Less is more
