He shares my blood
He haunts my soul
Will he ever know, ever know, he's cutting his own skin

He's my brother
Come straight from my mother
He's stronger than he thinks he is
Let him know, let him know

I pray to God, won't he help him
Does he deserve this
I don't know

At times he comes across selfish
But he ain't a bad person, this I know

His lies, his cheats, his stealings
Makes me cry till I stop breathing
He's simply lost his mind
Lord I'm asking you Lord
Will help him find it, ooh

Oh it's sad, find a will
And you'll find a way, oohoooh
I live by that
Each and every day... Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Daniel, won't you listen to the words I say
Writing this was harder than you'd ever think
You got a heart, you got a mind, you got a soul
And your eyes are kind, your eyes are kind, and your eyes are kind

Oohooooh
Hmmmmm

Daniel, won't you listen to the words I say
Writing this was harder than you'd ever think
