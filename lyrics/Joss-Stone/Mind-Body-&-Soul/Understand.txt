[Chorus:]
I hope you'll understand
That I can't always come when you call
Understand everybody has their faults
Please understand not to worry who I'm with or what I do
Cause I understand that I'm in love with you
Do you understand that I'm in love with you

I keep our song on repeat
On my ipod, even when I sleep
And in my dream I'm holding you
Alone on an island just us two

[Chorus:]

The last guy had me so wrong
He kept complaining I was away too long
Don't treat me that way cause in your head
You've got to trust me I won't be led

[Chorus:]

I hope your mind ain't working overtime
I hope your memories are full of good times with me
Don't trip if right now I can't answer the phone
Cause you know that soon I'll be coming home

[Chorus:]

Do you understand
Cause I understand
Do you understand that I'm in love with you boy
I'm so in love with you, so in love with you
Cause I understand
Do you?
Do you understand that I'm in love with you
Do you understand I'm in love with you
