You caught my eye
And out of nowhere you appeared by surprise
And it's not like me but certainly
I heard myself calling for you

Could it be fate?
I'm feeling butterflies
And I can't escape
And it's like a rush that's coming over me
The sight of you just takes me away

Chorus:
Boy, you're so fine
And I wanna tell ya so
I'm much too shy
Wanna make you mine
But I don't know how

Got so much time
Your attitude, everything
You make me smile
Think I'm falling in deep for no reason why
I can't help myself,
Yeah, yeah

Friends think I'm wrong
For being head over heels
I should be strong
Should I stay and deal with it
Or should I just let go?

[Chorus:]

Feeling crazy, my heartbeat's racing now
I can't fight it
Got to make you mine
But I don't know how

Baby let me know what's up now
Ya got to show me somehow, how you feel
'Cause I can't take it no more
I really need to know what's good with you, boy
[Chorus:]
