You see I know change
I see is change
I embody change
All we do is change
Yea, I know change
We're born to change
We sometimes regard it as a metaphor
That reflects the way we want things to be
In fact, change takes time
It exceeds all expectations
It requires both now and then
See, although the players change,
The song remains the same
And the truth is,
You gotta have the balls to change
