[Verse]
Get your head out your dreams the would say
Ooh, Shot me down time and time again
Stubborn little girl she refuses to change
Catch a cloud but you can't pin me down

[Chorus:]
Girl they won't believe it
I finally found some sweet through the bitters of life
Ooh Ooh
Girl they won't believe it
In a world where the sun's even shining inside

[Verse]
Took a minute but I caught it
They won't believe it
Mmm now I'm in love a deeper way
Tell me who would have thought this could satisfy me
All I need is a kiss from a melody

[Chorus:]
Ooh Ooh
Girl they won't believe it
Girl they won't believe it
That I've finally found some sweet through the bitters of life
Oh Oh
Girl they won't believe it
Girl they won't believe it
In a world where the sun's even shining inside
Ooh
Girl they won't believe it
I've finally found something sweet through the bitters of life
Ooh Ooh
Girl you won't believe it
In a world where the sun's even shining inside
Ooh you won't believe it
Girl they won't believe it
I finally found some sweet through the bitters of life

Oh oh, say girl they won't believe it

[Bridge:]
Girls say it now
Say with me
Ooh hoo
[Repeat 3 times]
