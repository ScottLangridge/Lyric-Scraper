[CHORUS]
You're my bad habit
I'm trying not to love you like I do
(but it's no use you know there's no use you know there's no use)
You're my bad habit... no somehow I don't wanna be rid of you
(but it's no use you know there's no use)

It's obvious to me your kiss is lethal
Your drug of choice is love and I can't come down
All the names under the sunre's more than one reason
You could be everyone but I still want you bad (want you bad)
Some say it's sad (say it's sad)

[CHORUS]
Always got someone out lookin for you
And sometimes I just wanna knock you out
You'd say I'd lost half of my brain
Clinically I'm insane
Cause I fiend for you bad (for you bad)
You're the best I ever had (ever had)

[CHORUS]
You do me so wrong
But you love me so right
There's more than one reason
Why you shouldn't be in me life
To tell you I don't want you no more would be a lie
I gotta step back and accept the fact that
You're my you're my bad habit

[CHORUS 2x]

I need to have you baby (baby)
I'm lost without your taste and (ooh I'm lost without)
You're my drug my lifetime craving (you're the drug you're the vice that I love)
You're my bad habit baby you're my bad habit baby

Oh you're my cigarette
Even better you're my chocolate
A straight shot to the head

Oh I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be rid of you baby

All I need a fix or two
And it's gotta be you
You're my you're my you're my
You're my bad habit baby
