Has love intentionally
Showed me that he or she
Hides in a melody

We say it's hard to find
You know that love divine
That we're all talking about

Well, I've been wasting all of my time
'Cause music's my Mr. Right
And I know this love will love me right

Confused my mind with ease
It's taken over me
Happily...
Happily, baby
Happily play for me
Happily play for me
Happily, baby
Happily play for me
Play for me Charlie
Play for me, baby
Happily
Happily
Happily
Happily, baby
