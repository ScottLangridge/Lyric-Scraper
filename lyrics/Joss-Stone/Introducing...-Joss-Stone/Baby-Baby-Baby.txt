[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me do you really love me
Baby, baby, baby
Will you always be there for me
I can't live without your lovin
Baby can't you see
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me do you love me now

[Verse]
I can't wait to see your face everyday
I can't explain the way I feel when I'm around you
There's a space in my heart that belongs to only you
And no one else in this world comes close to you
Do you understand what I'm saying
Do you understand me
Got a thing for you and I'm not playing
It's something I need to know

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me do you really love me
Baby, baby, baby
Will you always be there for me
I can't live without your lovin
Baby can't you see
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me do you love me now
Tell me do you love me now

[Verse]
I can't imagine how my life would be without you
Oooop
I don't know if I'd survive another day
Oooop
No pressure but I'd love to keep you safely
Promise me it's real
And that you would never fake it
Do you understand what I'm saying
Do you understand me
Got a thing for you and I'm not playing
I'm not playing
I'm not playing

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me do you really love me
Baby, baby, baby
Will you always be there for me
I can't live without your lovin
Baby can't you see
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me do you love me now
Tell me do you love me now

[Verse]
Ooh Ooh
Love me baby, love me baby
Nothing else don't matter
Your love is all I'm after
Ooh I need to have ya
I don't need no other man
You're the one my heart demands
I'm your girl
You're my world
Please don't let me down
Don't let me down
Tell me do you really love me
Baby, baby, baby
Will you always be there for me

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby
I can't live without your loving
Baby can't you see
Baby, baby

[Bridge:]
Tell me do you love me now
Tell me do you love me now
Tell me do you love me now

Gotta let me know that you love me so
[Repeat]
