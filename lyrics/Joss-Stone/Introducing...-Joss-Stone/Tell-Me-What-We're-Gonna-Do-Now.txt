Yes, we have arrived
Joss Stone
Uh huh
It's for the world world world world
Uh

[Verse]
You don't have to make your mind up
I just wanna take my time with you
Yeah
If that's alright, it's alright
Oh forgive me if I get too shy but
Maybe you're the reason why, love
I'm feelin' butterflies

Somethin' bout the look in your eyes
Oooh it just makes me feel so right

[Chorus:]
When my mind's void
You're my joy
You're the dream when I sleep
And hey I'm for ya yeah I adore ya
You're everything
That I need
And I love how you love me
If I'm made for you
You're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what we're gonna do now
Yeah tell me what we're gonna do now
Yeah yeah

[Verse]
Funny how my world keeps spinnin'
Sometimes you can be so silly
You know just how to make me laugh
Ooh, your skin is so lovely
It moves me when you touch me
I know that you got my back
It feels so safe when you hold me
It's already like you know me

When my mind's void
You're my joy
You're the dream when I sleep
And hey I'm for ya yeah I adore ya
You're everything that I need
I love how you love me
If I'm made for you
You're made for me
It's too good to be true
So tell me what we're gonna do now

[Bridge:]
Oh right now
See baby I love how you make me smile
Don't leave please stay awhile
Let's make this happen
I don't care how

[Common]
Right now lets stay in the present
Can't worry bout tomorrow cause today is a blessin
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you
I see my mom in you
It's like a feelin' in ya stomach
When you want it so bad
If we keep keeping it fresh
It ain't gonna go bad
I've been through the valley of love
Rode through the shores of Cali
Just to find peace of mind
Looking to the sky
Asking for at least a sign
Beautiful you came at such a decent time
When we combine it's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined
You remind me of the divine
So easy
Love can be lost and then found, like Stevie
I just love having you around
You wearing the gown
I'm wearing the crown
Pound for pound
We the freshest couple in town

[Chorus:]
When my mind's void
You're my joy
You're my dream
And hey I'm for ya yeah I adore ya
You're everything
And I love how you love me baby
I'm made for you oh
You're made for me

Ooh tell me what we're gonna do
Tell me what we're gonna do
Tell me what we're gonna do
Tell me what we're gonna do
