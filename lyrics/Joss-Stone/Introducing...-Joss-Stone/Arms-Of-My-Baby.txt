I've been running around and
I gotta slow down and spend time with my man
From city to city
Pleasing the world but neglecting him
Living on the road is so damn tough
Talking on the phone is never enough
I gotta get back to the place that I'm used to

Chorus:
And I, I
Felt like I need to be in the arms of my baby
And I, I
Gotta find my way back,
Home to my baby now

I've been lacking affection
Craving for the touch of his gentle hands
So much love and devotion
No matter what I go through he understands
He sends me flowers but they don't compare
To how he runs his fingers through my hair
I gotta get back to the place that I'm used to

Chorus

(feel like I need my baby now)
Feel like I need my baby
(feel like I need my baby now)
Uh ooh
(feel like I need my baby now)
Oh I need him yes I need him just to tell him that I love him oh, yea

Oh I, Feel like I need to be in the arms of my baby

(oh I, i gotta find my way back to the arms of my baby, now)
I need him baby
I need my baby
I need him right here
I need him in the morning
I need him in the night
I need him 24/7
(in the arms of my baby)

In the arms of my baby now
