[Verse]
Work it
Girls we gotta work it like we do
Turn a head or two

Cause we're worth it
So I ain't gonna waste my time waiting on you
Gotta make your move

You've had my number fot two or three days or more
If you're a real man then you can't ignore mmmm, mmmm this

Sometimes it's physical
But I want supernatural
I don't have wings but I'm ready to fall
I deserve it all

[Chorus:]
Headturner yeah
Soul burner
Ya gonna watch me walk, then watch me walk

Headturner yeah
Are you a slow learner
Come and take my hand
Cause I'll find another man

[Verse]
If you're gonna watch me walk, then watch me walk
Ya gotta earn it
Nothing in life is free you gotta bring your love to me baby, baby, baby
Emotional, mmm I got it
Sexual, mmm I got it
Spiritual, God knows I've got it
What you want, baby I got it

[Chorus:]
Headturner yeah
Soul burner
I ya gonna watch me walk, then watch me walk

Headturner yeah
Are you a slow learner
Come and take my hand
Cause I'll find another man

If ya gonna watch me walk, then watch me walk
Uh huh

[Bridge:]
No one can love you like I love you
No one can do the things that I would do to you
I'd do something about it if I were you
Or feel my heels as I'm walking over you

[Chorus:]
Headturner yeah
Soul burner
I ya gonna watch me walk, then watch me walk

Headturner yeah
Are you a slow learner
Come and take my hand
I'll find another man

[repeat chorus]
