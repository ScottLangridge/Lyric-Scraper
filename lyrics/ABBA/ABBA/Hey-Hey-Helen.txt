So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you pay
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for daddy

Hey hey helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey helen
Can you make it alone
(yes you can)

So you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
Does it make you sad
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom

Hey hey helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey helen (hey hey helen)
What's the matter with you
Hey hey helen (hey hey helen)
Don't you know what to do
(yes you do)
(ahah, yes you do yes you do)
(ahah, yes you do yes you do)

Hey hey helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey helen (hey hey helen)
What's the matter with you
Hey hey helen (hey hey helen)
Don't you know what to do
Hey hey helen (hey hey helen)
Now you live on your own
Hey hey helen (hey hey helen)
