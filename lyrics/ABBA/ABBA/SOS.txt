What happened to those days, they seem so hard to find.
I try and reach or you, but you just close your mind.
What ever happened to our love? I wish I understood.
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.
(Chorus Below)

So when you near me, darling can't you hear me?
Sos!
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me!
Sos!
When your gone, how can I even try to go on?
When your gone, though I try, I cannot carry on!

You seem so far away, though you are standing near.
You made me feel alive, but something died of fear.
What ever happened to our love? I wish I understood.
What happened to our love, it used to be so good.

[Chorus:]
