I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me...

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling...

Now I hear them moving muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building and I'm close to fainting crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy there is no escaping now, I'm crackin' up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me...

Now I hear them moving muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building and I'm close to fainting crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy there is no escaping now, I'm crackin' up

Now I hear them moving muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm crackin' up voices growing louder, irritation building and I'm close to fainting crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling, going crazy there is no escaping now, I'm crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Now I hear them moving muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
Voices growing louder, irritation building and I'm close to fainting crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
They must know by now I'm in here trembling in a terror evergrowing crackin' up
(I have been waiting for these visitors)
My whole world is falling, going crazy there is no escaping now, I'm crackin' up
