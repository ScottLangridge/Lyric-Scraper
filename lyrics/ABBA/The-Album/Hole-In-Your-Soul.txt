You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, way down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst
(and when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed
(and you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

My friend sam is a chauffeur, annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office, sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends
(together again)
When I meet my friends
(I'm gonna see them now)
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

Ah-haa (ah-haa, ah-haa)
You paint your world and use all colours
Ah-haa (ah-haa)
And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
Ah-haa (ah-haa, ah-haa)
The songs you sing are too romantic
Ah-haa (ah-haa)
And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst
(you know you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed
(and you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
