The latest and greatest... Amazing arrival
No conscience, no shame... For the game of survival
Thieves and villains... And fraudulent swindlers
Gathered in tribute... With masks of respect
A big hand, hurray!  Oh come on you trustful
Let the band play a waltz into mischief
The chairman is speaking... Instructs the apprentice
All faces are turned... To the wizard of sentence
Years of experience... Fall from his tongue
Like teardrops to puddles... They rippled among
A big hand, hurray!  Oh come on you trustful
Let the band play a waltz into mischief
This kid of the cowboys... Of fastest deception
Writes down his kiddings... To ruptuous reception
Calls on the crowd... Of white-pointed heads
To check on the carpets... While we're in our beds
(Nelly the elephant packed her trunk and said goodbye to the circus)
A big hand, hurray!  Oh come on you trustful
Let the band play a waltz into mischief
A big hand, hurray!  Oh come on you trustful
Let the band play a waltz into mischief
A big hand, hurray!  Oh come on you trustful
Let the band play a waltz into mischief
