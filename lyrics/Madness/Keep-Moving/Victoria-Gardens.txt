I just left Victoria Gardens and walked through cardboard city land
A burnt out star was asking, how would I like to shake his hand
I walked on in no hurry (Hurry, hurry, hurry) and wondered where did we go wrong?
We're looking and listening and hoping that things are changing for the better
Don't want to preach or teach the blues to you now brother
I walked on in no hurry (Hurry, hurry, hurry) and wondered where did we go wrong?
We're looking and listening and hoping that things are changing for the better
Don't want to preach or teach the blues to you now brother
It's a bloody fine situation that we find ourselves in
He said something I couldn't mention (Here) and we laughed with him again
I walked on in no hurry (Hurry, hurry, hurry) and wondered where did we go wrong?
We're looking and listening and hoping that things are changing for the better
And trying to see if what you're teaching is the truth sir
She said it's for the good of us all (Of us all, of us all, of us all)
And now it is early evening, I look across grey Leicester Square
A large and silent crowd were walking, said they had every right to be there (Right to be there)
I walked on in no hurry (Hurry, hurry, hurry) and wondered where did we go wrong?
We're looking and listening and hoping that things are changing for the better
Don't want to preach or teach the blues to you now brother
We're looking and listening and hoping that things are changing for the better
And trying to see if what you're teaching is the truth sir
We're looking and listening and hoping that things are changing for the better
