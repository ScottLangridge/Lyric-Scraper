It's been some time since the smile upon my face
Had I sneaked previewing town
It's been a while since I gave chase
It's been some time since the girl from round my way
Came and took me by the hand
Been a long time since I came around
I can remember when I stood on my head
Walking straight across the ground
Still picture their laughing faces
Catch me, I'm falling into my past
Catch me, the deeper the louder the laugh
I was told to grow up soon, face my consequences
Being told it was high time, high time to come to my senses
Climbing up to the top floor, stood the look of pleasure
Such a silly aged man with an attic full of treasure
Catch me, I'm falling into my past
Deeper, the deeper the louder the laugh
I remember when I was ten, things were somewhat better then
Time went by so easily, is this the way life's supposed to be?
But looking back I wonder why it seems to pass so quickly by
Memories can make you cry, I close my eyes, my tears I try to hide
I was thinking about Tamer Lane
Of all the funny places
I was thinking, a short time ago
Catch me, I'm falling into my past
Catch me, the deeper the louder the laugh
Catch me, I'm falling into my past
Deeper, the deeper the louder the laugh
