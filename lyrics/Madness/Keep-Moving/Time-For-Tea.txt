Scouring through the wasteland
With an uge to take
Anything that comes into view
Only ten more puffs to tea time
I've found eating so time consuming

Willie, oh willie she cried
It's time for tea
Willie, where in hell has he gone
It's time for tea

South of the wateland at your D. I. Y.
The inconsiderate rings his till
Offering plans of easy credit
Claims he'll cause a killing in the school half term

Willie, oh willie she cried
It's time for tea
Willie, where in hell has he gone
It's time for tea

And welly well well well what have I found here
A hiding place made by frigid air
I think I'll try it on and give my mates a scare
They'll all be searching neither here nor there

Willie, oh willie she cried
It's time for tea
Willie, where in hell has he gone
It's time for tea

Long depress of autumn breeze
Sucking on a rubber back teeth
Plays into the hands of the hardware man
Who selfishly "i don't care"
