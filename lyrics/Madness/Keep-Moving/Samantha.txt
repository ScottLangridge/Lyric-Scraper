One night in a cold sweat
I heard the call
So without fear and free from fright
I walked tall
As I crept the passages
Only just but faint
In and out of the central heating
It came and then went

Samantha, samantha dear
I have to be gone
Samantha, oh samantha dear
But ooh, she slept on

Well I've itched a thousand itches
But this one tops them all
While crouched down with an ear to the ground
I saw the call

Springing up in disbelief
The supension spilt
And peering in a bathroom mirror
Hung the men with guilt

Samantha, samantha dear
I have to be gone
Samantha, oh samantha dear
But ooh, she slept on

One night in a cold sweat
I heard the call
So without fear and free from fright
I walked tall

Samantha, samantha dear
I have to be gone
Samantha, oh samantha dear
But

Samantha, samantha dear
I have to be gone
Samantha, oh samantha dear
But

There were all sorts of funny faces
Being pulled
But mine was the funniest face

Samantha, samantha dear
I have to be gone
Samantha, oh samantha dear
But ooh, she slept on
