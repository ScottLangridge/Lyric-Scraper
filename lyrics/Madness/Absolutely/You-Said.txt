(Barson/Mcpherson)
You said you're leaving, well that's ok,
You said you've had enough, what can I say?
I suppose I'll be sad for a week or two,
But in the end, it's the same for me and you,
We'll both be sorry through and through.
You said you're leaving, well that's ok,
You said you've had enough, what can I say?
I suppose I'll be sad for a week or two,
But in the end, it's the same for me and you,
We'll both be sorry through and through.
Me and you.
You must stop doing this, you've got to change,
Cause you hold all the cards, you've got range,
Every time you go away, I think of you.
You said you're leaving, you said this,
You said, you said that,
You said you don't want to see me no more,
You said you don't want me to come to your door,
You said, you said,
I suppose I'll be sad for a week or two,
But in the end, it's the same for me and you,
We'll both be sorry through and through.
Yes you do.
You must stop doing this, you've got to change,
Cause you hold all the cards, you've got range,
Every time you go away, I think of you.
