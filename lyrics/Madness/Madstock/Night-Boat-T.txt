Night boat to Cairo

It's just gone noon, half past monsoon on the banks of the river Nile
Here comes the boat only half-afloat, oarsman grins a toothless smile
Only just one more to this desolate shore, last boat along the river Nile
Doesn't seem to care, no more wind in his hair as he reaches his last half mile
The oar snaps in his hand before he reaches dry land but the sound doesn't deafen his smile
Just pokes at wet sand with an oar in his hand, floats off down the river Nile, floats off down the river Nile

All aboard, night boat to Cairo
