Madness, madness, they call it madness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
It's plain to see that is what they mean to me
Madness, madness, they call it gladness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
I'm about to explain that someone is losing their brain
Hey, madness, madness, I call it gladness

Propaganda ministers, propaganda ministers
I've got a heavy due, I'm gonna walk all over you, 'cause
Madness, madness, they call it madness
Well if this is madness then I know I'm filled with gladness
It's gonna be rougher, it's gonna be tougher, pa-da-da, pa-da-da
And I won't be the one who's gonna suffer
Oh no, I won't be the one who's gonna suffer
You are gonna be the one, you
