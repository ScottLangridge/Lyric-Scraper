Well they tell me about the pie up in the sky.
Waiting for me when I die.
But between the day your born and when you die.
They never seem to hear even your cry.

So as soon as the sun will shine.
I'm gonna get my shine out what's mine.
And then the harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.
The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.

Well the opus' are trying to keep me down.
Trying to drag me under-ground.
And they think that they have got the battle won.
Oh! I say forgive them lord the do not what they've done.

So as soon as the sun will shine.
I'm gonna get my shine out what's mine.
And then the harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all. (what I say, now what I say)
The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.

(yeah!)

(yeah!)

Well I'll keep on fighting for the things I want. (for the things I want.)
Though I know that when you dead you gone.
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave.
Then living as a puppet or a slave.

So as soon as the sun will shine.
I'm gonna get my shine out what's mine.
And then the harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all. (it's true)
Oh! The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.
Oh! The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all. (what I say, now what I say)
The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.

[instrumental]

The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.
Oh! The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all. (yes.)
The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all. (what I say.)
The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.
Oh! The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all. (what I say.)
The harder they come, the harder they fall.
One and all.
