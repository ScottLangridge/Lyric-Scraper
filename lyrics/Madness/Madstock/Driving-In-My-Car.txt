I've been driving in my car, it's not quite a jaguar
I bought it in primrose hill from a bloke from brazil
It was made in fifty-nine in a factory by the tyne
It says morris on the door, the G. P. O. Owned it before
I drive in it for my job, the governor calls me a slob
But I don't really care, give me some gas and the open air

It's a bit old but it's mine, I mend it in my spare time
Just last week I changed the oil, the rocker valves and the coil
Just last week I changed the oil
Last week it went round the clock, I also had a little knock
I dented somebody's fender, he learnt not to park on a bender, ha ha ha

I've been driving in my car, it don't look much but I've been far
I drive up to muswell hill, I've even been to selsey bill
I drove along the a45, I had her up to 58
This copper stopped me the other day, you're mistaken what could I say
The tyres were a little worn, they were O. K., I could have sworn
I like driving in my car, I'm satisfied I've got this far

I like driving in my car, it don't look much but I've been far
I like driving in my car, even with a flat tyre
I like driving in my car, it's not quite a jaguar
I like driving in my car, I'm satisfied I've got this far
