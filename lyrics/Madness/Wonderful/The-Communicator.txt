I am the communicator
I said I am the communicator

Chorus
And I go yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee
And I go yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee
And I go yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee
And I go yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee yedee

Unconditional love nothing but reconciliation
It happens
Standing room now only for the Madness nation
Gotta get a tickle on a ticket for the grand slam station
All aboard for the Madness nation

I am the communicator
I said I am the communicator

Let me tell you how I feel
I feel I'm scarred for life

Yeah I am the communicator
I said I am the communicator

Oh yesterday was history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Today is a gift that's why we call it the present
All aboard aboard back of the big blue train relations
Standing room now only for the Madness nation

I said I am the communicator
I said I am the communicator
Come on I am the communicator
Oh yeah I am the communicator

Let me tell you how
I feel I'm scarred for life
