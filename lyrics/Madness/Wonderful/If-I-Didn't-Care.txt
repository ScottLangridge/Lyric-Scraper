I know there's time
I know there's time
I know there's time
I know there's time

If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way
If this isn't love then why do I thrill
And what makes my head go round and round
While my heart stands still

If I didn't care would it be the same
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name
And could I be sure that this is love beyond compare
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you
If I didn't care

I know there's time
I know there's time
I know there's time
I know there's time

If I didn't care if I didn't care
If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way
And if this isn't love then why do I thrill
And what makes my head go round and round
While my heart stands still

I know there's time for us
I know there's time
I know there's time for us
I know there's time
