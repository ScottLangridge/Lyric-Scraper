She'd gotten used to the idle life
Following the sun was her full time occupation
A lesson to us all footloose for the education
Oh but look at her now foxtrotting the globe
With her head in the clouds

I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat
And I don't think that it's funny it looks like I've sunk my boat
But she'll keep me dangling on and on and on

Well furs and pearls I'm trapped in your pocket
Where six foot toys stumble upon it
Your high class ways have seen better days
But to me you'll always be complicating infatuating

I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat
And I don't think that it's funny it looks like I've sunk my boat

I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat
And I don't think that it's funny it looks like I've sunk my boat
But she keeps me dangling on and on and on

Royal Britannia the jet set dreams on and on
Into another sun drenched scene
Where kings and queens and jesters preen

I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat
And I don't think that it's funny it looks like I've sunk my boat

I haven't got no money to keep this affair afloat
And I don't think that it's funny it looks like I've sunk my boat
