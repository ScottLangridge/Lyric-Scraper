We want Freddy for our leader
Freddy is a man of class
We Want Freddy for our leader
All stand and raise your champagne glass

Gentlemen and assassins and ladies of the night
I call upon this evening in the hope of shedding some light
I can't go into detail or finger unfounded fools
But there are some here amongst us that are not playing to the rules

I've rounded up the lowlife and local C.I.D
Offered a free massage or else the third degree
There is no simple solution in this life we lead
So make things easy for yourself to the baronage concede

We want Freddy for our leader
Freddy is a man of class
We Want Freddy for our leader
All stand and raise your champagne glass

Peace shall not prevail entirely came the stark warning today
From his hospital bed Drip-Fed Fred vowed he was here to stay
"I'll tell ya summit for nothing" he claimed "never in all my days"
"'ave I felt so intimidated by the cheap on display"

Aah-ah-ah-ah
Aah-ah-ah-ah

We want Freddy for our leader
Freddy is a man of class
We Want Freddy for our leader
All stand and raise your champagne glass

And approaching the pulpit the right honorable Reverend Greene
"we are gathered here this evening to pay our due"
"to Drip-Fed Fred who just last night fell out his hospital bed"
"we know the nonce behind it, who slipped the night P.D - ooh"
"the word is out no without doubt you will answer to me"

Gentlemen and assassins and ladies of the night
I call upon this evening in the hop of shedding new light
There is a simple solution one called honor amongst thieves
So we'll take pity on your souls and only cap your knees

Amah-ah-ah-ah
Amah-ah-ah-ah
Aah-ah-ah-ah
Aah-ah-ah-ah

We want Freddy for our leader
Freddy is a man of class
We Want Freddy for our leader
All stand and raise your champagne glass

We want Freddy for our leader
Freddy is a man of class
We Want Freddy for our leader
All stand and raise your champagne glass

We want Freddy for our leader
Freddy is a man of class
We Want Freddy for our leader
All stand and raise your champagne glass
