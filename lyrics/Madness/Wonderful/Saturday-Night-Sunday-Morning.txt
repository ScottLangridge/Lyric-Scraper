I knew you'd come back we always do
Like thieves returning to the scene of a crime
Did they tell you everything has changed just everything
Oh everything has changed just everything

Its not Saturday night Sunday morning
There was something else I meant to say
Its not Saturday night Sunday morning
There was so much more I meant to say to you

You know they still want to talk about you
But they don't want anything too real
So most of the conversation revolves around
Things that happened twenty years ago at least

They must have told you everything has changed everything
Oh everything must change everything
Its not Saturday night Sunday morning
There was so much more I could've said to you
Its not Saturday night Sunday morning
There was so much more I meant to say to you

Its not Saturday night Sunday morning
There was so much more I meant to say
Its not Saturday night Sunday morning
There was so much more I meant to say to you
