When you're going to the top and you have no time to stop
Then you have to travel light and you'd better go by night
Cause it's not a pretty sight when you're going to the top
And you're never going to stop and you won't let nobody block
Your way to the top

And though bodies they may fall old friends up against the wall
Can't let feelings in the way as if you had some anyway
Some will have to move aside true intent you'll always hide
Wagging tongues may call you snide you may not know who's on your side
When you're going to the top

But you could let it go tonight
Watch it all fade out of sight
There's still some time to mend your ways
Don't you know it's love that pays

Still you've heard it all before and I don't want to be a bore
So I'll just be on my way maybe we will meet one day
Probably won't have much to say if I see you passing by
Cause you're going much to high and you may well never stop
Cause you're going to the top

Maybe we will meet one day
Probably won't have much to say
So I'll just say toodle ooh and the best of luck to you
When I see you passing by when you're going much too high
When you're going to the top

When you're going to the toooooooop
When you're going to the toooooooop

But you could take my hand tonight
We'd let it all fade out of sight
There's still some time to mend your ways
Don't you know it's love that pays
