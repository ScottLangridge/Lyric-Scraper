Staggering home,
The headlights throw a shadow up and upon
Friends and loved ones that have done no wrong
But no longer mean anything to me
Am I mumbling on into a crystal glass that echoes a song
The enticement invites you alongA path of exterior colour

But come the morning shivering and contorting
To border on the brink for just another sink
Oh take me down for one more round

Oh involve me in libations
Stick arock in my foundation
Pickle my relations
Put me probations
I'LL take you down for one last round

Lovestruck I've fallen for a lamppost given her my upmostSpilling out my deepest feelings
Now all I want to do is snuggle up to you
A night cap in the earls morning dew

Look! What have I become?
Distancing myself so far and from
But gazing up I wave the night boat on
For now it's heaven in deepest Tottenham

What have I done to deserve this fate?
Its all going wrong
Even my cab fares been and goneNow I'm lagging in deepest Tottenham

Frightening, frightening strike me down with lightning
I've given in to fighting
Now all i want to do is snuggle up to you
A night cap in the early morning dew.
