I can read what's going through your mind
I can see what you hide in your eyes
Yes I'm going to put a spell on you
Just to see what you will do

I'm a wizard and there's magic in the air
I'm a sinner and my friend you'd best beware
There's music everywhere

Can you see the full moon in the sky?
Time like water flows by till we die
Every moment wasted leaves it's mark
Each setting sun leaves us standing in the dark

One must forgive the noisy rushing fools
Who have no time for nature's natural school
They cannot see the life that's in their hands
Like ghosts they disappear across the land
