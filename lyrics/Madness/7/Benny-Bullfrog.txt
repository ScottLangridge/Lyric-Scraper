(Thompson/Foreman)
So there I am polished heart throat in full puff
I look the part my wad is packed to reimburse.
I've yet to re-rehearse many moons spent on lovelines lent from
Long-legged pop-eyed fat-necked Benny Bullfrog.
Final run-through polish up
The flower of love's my buttercup.
Moon in June for you I'll croon
Just like pop-eyed fat-necked Benny Bullfrog.
Mean piece of muscle I'm Melvin Toad,
I dice with death, across the road.
Hop aboard my lover's leap
Fat-necked Quatermass
Who needs a Benny Bullfrog.
Here she comes (Keep a cool head)
My legs numb (Keep a cool head)
I can't run (Keep a cool head)
High! My name's Hunky how d'you do
I catch a fly in one swoop
I catch a fly just for you
That's if you do want me to
But you're not hungry I know
A sixth sense gave me a clue.
I know what else we can do.
(You creep!)
Long-legged pop-eyed fat-necked Benny Bullfrog.
Wish I was Benny Bullfrog
Cool as Benny Bullfrog
What's the secret, Bullfrog?
