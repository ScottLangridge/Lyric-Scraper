(McPherson/Barson)
This is disposable, throw it away,
This is an animal, don't let it stray,
That was the past, so leave it behind,
This is the future, it's all in our mind.
Feeding your interest, in between lines,
Reading the caring one, sign of the times,
This is your Englishman, this is his lawn,
This is your female, undone and torn.
We are the people, and we really care,
We don't really look, we just like to stare,
Unprintable feelings that play on your mind
Get written in innocence, pretend we are blind.
Patience the virtue not learnt in schools
A-ha, it's funny to break all the rules.
Law-breakers are broken, and so we all share
The family problems, the paper that cares
Cheapest and brightest, sexiest news,
We'll make up some stories with unbiased cues.
We are the people, and we really care,
We don't really look, we just like to stare,
Unprintable feelings that play on your mind
Get written in innocence, pretend we are blind.
