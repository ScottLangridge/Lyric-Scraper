(Thompson/Barson)
I wear my cap with pride
When swaying side to side
Indoors where it be crude
Too late to find me shrewd.
I never lay in doubt
When walking from about
At home where it be warm
You're sound asleep unborn!
I'm a small chap
Walk tall chap
When it rains
Cats and dogs
From my pocket I pick a pac-a-mac.
Inside a rubber wall yelling
Screams echo, off the ceiling.
My love could penetrate
So I'll leave you now prostrate.
My fag smoulders out and out
And odours waft there about
So I give my head a kip
My cap's worn to a split.
I'm a small chap
Walk tall chap
When it rains
Cats and dogs
From my pocket I pick a pac-a-mac.
I wear my cap with pride
When swaying side to side
Indoors where I feel nude
Too late to find me shrewd.
I never lay in doubt
When walking from about
At home where it be warm
You're sound asleep unborn!
I'm a small chap
Walk tall chap
When it rains
Cats and dogs
From my pocket I pick a pac-a-mac.
