(Mcpherson/Barson)
The sun shines through the open window,
The empty sides the shadows shallow
My arm circles nothing at all,
My fingers reach to touch the wall.
Missing you when I'm away,
Think of things I'd like to say,
Almost cry to hear you voice,
Lying with me,
Got no choice.
Mundane thoughts during the day,
Suddenly to see your face,
Interrupted thoughts have gone,
Knowing that you're all I want.
Missing you when I'm away,
Think of things I'd like to say,
Almost cry to hear you voice,
Lying with me,
Got no choice.
The awesome love I feel for you,
To see you now what would I do,
The desperate feeling you're not there,
To be with you pull out my hair.
Missing you when I'm away,
Think of things I'd like to say,
Almost cry to hear you voice,
Lying with me,
Got no choice.
