(Mcpherson/Foreman/Clive Langer)
No I never heard through the grapevine
How you left long before your time
But in France on the radio
I could not understand a word
But I felt you go
We waited all night for the midnight lover's calling
It was the coldest day of the year
And I'm still thawing
I didn't sleep a wink
But while radio played
I was day dreaming
Of what might have been
While the cold night air was freezing
The coldest night
The coldest day of the year
What is happening mother father please
Who will save us from the autumn breeze
Shivering to a halt no one wants to speak too soon
Although we all knew under the pale blue moon
The pale moon
The pale blue moon
What happens then when the sun goes down
Tell me what's the word Johannesburg
When the rent goes up and the lights go down
On the coldest day outside the coldest town
We waited all night and I'm still falling
I didn't sleep a wink
But while radio played
I was day dreaming
Of what might have been
While the cold night air was freezing
The coldest night
The coldest day of the year
The coldest night
The coldest day of the year
The coldest night, day, year.
