Down between the sunbeams the moneylenders chat
Hiding in the shade outside a council flat
Kids in the lift looking for things to throw

And practising their aim on the heads below
They make their apologies with the quickness of their feet
Then lost in the heat haze that shimmers across the street

Underfoot the pavement is melting
Crumbling for the luckiest girl
The whole world is melting.

(white white heat)
I'm still not in until a week next wednesday
I'm holidaying on the roof til the big bad wolf goes away

In the street the pavement is melting
Crumbling for the luckiest girl
The whole world is melting.

White heat turns the street upside down.

Down between the sunbeams the debt collectors chat, chat, chat, chat,
Hiding in the shade outside a council flat
By the hairs on my chinny chin chin
I shall not let you in.

In the street the pavement is melting
Crumbling for the luckiest girl
The whole world is melting.

(for the luckiest girl in all the world)
(white, white heat)
