(Smyth)
When I considered how my life is spent
They cry but I know that everything is heaven sent
But why do people lie when all they want is truth at their tables
The sky is looking very blue today
It's so fine I'd agree with every word you say
About it it must be said it doesn't mean much at all
Time you make changes
Time you'll add ages
Time is walking with you by your side
There's no reason that we should complain
In the night everybody looks the same
It's so sad but we don't seem to be going forward at all

(Time)
Time
Time you make changes
Time you'll add ages
Time is walking with you by your side
Time you make changes
Time you'll add ages
Time is walking with you by your side
(Come on time)
Time you make changes
Time you'll add ages
Time is walking with you by your side
Time gentlemen please
Time
Time
