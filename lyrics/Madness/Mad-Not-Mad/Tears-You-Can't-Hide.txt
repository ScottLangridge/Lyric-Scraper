(Smyth)
Now I see tears you can't hide
Carry the world on your back
Heavy weights tear you apart
Now I see tears you can't hide
Feel in a rage can't speak up for yourself
All that you try to do it's no good anyway
Now I see tears you can't hide
No use saying it's a crime
Voices surround me but they lie, lie
Hold out your hand together make your stand
You may be alone you may feel scared inside
Now I see tears you can't hide
No use saying it's a crime
Voices surround me but they lie, lie
(Just hit me with your saxophone, Lee)
Now I see tears you can't hide
Now I see tears you can't hide
Now I see tears you can't
Tears you can't tears you can't hide
