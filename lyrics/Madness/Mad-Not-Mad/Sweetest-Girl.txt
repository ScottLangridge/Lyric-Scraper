The sweetest girl in all the world
These eyes are for you only
The sweetest girl in all the world
These eyes are for you only
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before me
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before me

When we walk in the dark
I never can tell
When when we walk in the dark
I never can tell
It's just loving it
Ooh loving it

The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The maddest group in all the world
How could they do this to me
The maddest group in all the world
How could they do this to me

What I want I shall take what you think that you know
Oh such an awful mistake to never let go

When the government falls I wish I could tell
When the city calls I never can tell

The weakest link in any chain
I always want to find it
The strongest words in each belief
Find out what's behind it
The politics is prior to
The vagaries of science
She left because she understood
The value of defiance

The sweetest girl in all the world
These eyes are for you only
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before me

(she wants to go, but she don't know why)
(loving it, ooh loving it)

The maddest group in all the world
How could they do this to me
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely

The sweetest girl in all the world
These words that die before me
The sweetest boy in all the world
His life has got so lonely
