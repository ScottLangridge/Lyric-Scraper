(McPherson/Foreman)
The government have announced
That London Bridge is to be closed
Under the full moon of May the third
All the light houses and seaside roads
No I never heard I never read in the news
Come on tell me, who's this for ?
Lighting the questions and
Burning the boats one by one
Burning the boats one by one by
Tap, tap, tap, birds that sing,
Telephone calls that do not ring,
One, two, three, what's the time ?
Who's that hanging off my line ?
I know that nothing lasts for ever
And I'm just waiting for the sun to set
Blowing dust from my loud hailer, on the roof.
Come on tell me, who's this for ?
Lighting the questions and
Burning the boats one by one
Burning the boats one by one
Burning the boats one by one by
The ministry of co-operation
Are washed and hanging on the line
There's a million burning questions
To set the Thames alight
Now I've joined an exclusive club
Just by being more than poor
I saw the deputy chairman, on the floor.
Come on tell me, who's this for ?
Lighting the questions and
Burning the boats one by one
Burning the boats one by one
Burning the boats one by one by
Burning the boats one by one
Burning the boats.
