I'll be your promotional copy in this here number one band
Take your business beyond your furthest dreams sounds
Sounds great sounds really grand but wait
Let us hurry now time is catching up
And it looks like the music hall race has caught me up

But I'll compete (yeah yeah)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (with the rest of the pack)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (on the beat)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (with a full deck)
For all that I'm worth

I'll be your popswop, come floppy disc, race you along the upper deck
Retrieve from you my with-held treasure,
Then watch you sink with you sunken rotting wreck,
Let us hurry now, time is running out,
Let's not forget time is money said the business man to his faithful scout.

But I'll compete (in the national press)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (with the back chat)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (on the beat)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (international)
For all that it's worth

We must hurry now time is closing in
And I'm getting no younger in fact
I'm five years closer to my pension scheme

But I'll compete (yeah yeah)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (for the ratings)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (on the beat)
For all that it's worth
I'll compete (with the rest of the pack)
For all that I'm worth
