(Thompson)
I can fly you to your loved ones but I can promise no return
To a shell-shocked God forsaken where their craters still they burn
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Still the worst is over that I hope you understand
The you're one more hurdle over our protector of the land
Have a drink on me
I put it down to the company
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Here you have this medal you can even melt it down
Or frame it in the living room every time you turn around
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
I heard you shout for yesterday, but I was sleeping on the job
And I dreamt of fighters miles away whose lives I had to rob
Have a drink on me
I put it down to the company
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Here you have this medal you can even melt it down
Or frame it in the living room every time you turn around
I can fly your loved ones to you
With guarantee of no return
And if John Wayne's dummy's bounce off
Don't look shocked when it comes your turn
Have a drink on me
I put it down to company
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Hip hip!
Hip hip!
Hip hip hip hip!
Hip hip!
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Hip hip hip hip!
Hip hip!
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
Three cheers to the blue skinned beast hip hip hip hip!
To the blue skinned beast hip hip!
