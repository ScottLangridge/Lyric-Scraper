These are the streets I used to walk
On summer nights, sit out and talk
That's the house where I used to live
I remember what I would give

This is the town I won't forget
And after anger there's nothing left
Walking now round and round
Familiar sights are open ground

Being here again, I can recall
Forgotten moments, the rise and fall

We used to live where children play
They leave their homes a mile away
To come and stand in trees and grass
Where we once walked the memories last

Being here again, I can recall
Forgotten moments, the rise and fall

The sun shines east, the sun shines west
But I know where the sun shines best
Casey street in the afternoon
Once again it's over too soon

Being here again, I can recall
Forgotten moments, the rise and fall

Being here again, I can recall
Forgotten moments, the rise and fall

Rise
(Rise, rise)
Rise and fall
Rise and fall
