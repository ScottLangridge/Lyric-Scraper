Wriggles from his captor's arms
Mr speaker gets the word and
Running now from the alarms
Speaks his mind free as a bird

Free now to roam around
Stand up straight when he quotes
Spread the word that he has found
Books of verse and scribbled notes

Mister speaker gets the word
(to tell the secrets he has heard)
Speaks so fast his words are slurred
(mister speaker gets the word)

Stands up straight outside my door
I bring you now the words I've learned
To whom it may concern senor
Tell my friends I have returned

Mister speaker gets the word
(to tell the secrets he has heard)
Speaks so fast his words are slurred
(mister speaker gets the word)

Excitement rages through his brain
Stirred and stirred throughout the years
Not enough time to explain
Eyes of many sighs of fear

Making space from colney hatch lane
Just some poetry my friend
Scuttles past my window frame
Vanishes right round the bend

Mister speaker gets the word
(to tell the secrets he has heard)
Speaks so fast his words are slurred
(mister speaker gets the word)
