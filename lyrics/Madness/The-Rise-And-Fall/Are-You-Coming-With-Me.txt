(Thompson/Barson)
Could it be someone's telling lies
Or could it be that I'm getting wise
Awoke myself from a nose-dive glide
I caught myself but you've lost all pride
I'm not going with you
Won't you come on with me?
See your world in a drift fly past
So good the feeling you want to last
I'm not going with you
Would you come on with me?
I'm not here to watch day and night
Or to hear you drift out of life
If I could wake you
A moment I would
Share you my lifeline
Feed you some good
If I could wake you
A moment I would
Share you my lifeline
Feed you some (good)
I'm worried for you
But you not for me
When everyone's living
I know where you'll be
If I should listen to your proposal
Put my future at your disposal
Promise me you'll keep yourself clean
Cut yourself from your mid-day dream.
If I could wake you
A moment I would
Share you my lifeline
Feed you some good
If I could wake you
A moment I would
Share you my lifeline and
Feed you some good
