I see a face that face is mine
The mirror marks the changing time
Her face I'll never see again
And mine will never be the same
That face was fine only yesterday
My problems seemed so far away

Reflections I see of myself
As in sickness as in health
As she left as for worse
No chance to re-rehearse

Try to forget try not to see
Who is that face looking at me
Reflections of yesterday
If only I could make you stay

One day past is like a year
She wouldn't say what made her leave
I didn't think she'd ever go
And why she did I'll never know
I wish I could return and see
But now it's just a memory

Reflections of yesterday
Reflections of yesterday

I see a face that face is mine
The mirror marks the changing time
Her face I'll never see again
And mine will never be the same

Reflections of yesterday
Reflections of yesterday
