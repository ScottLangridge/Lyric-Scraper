(Thompson/Foreman)
A sorting office in the Old Kent Road
Caters from coast to most
A nice little number if you're out of work
And aren't the sort to boast,
You're in need of a job, bob-a-job, rob-a-job
I'm your man to see
I'll sit I'll listen I'll not say a word
The less said would be best for we
Ooh, what a firm of naughty boys
Ooh, I've been a naughty boy
We don't want to mark each other's card
Except the one you need
I need you and your returns to help
Build my company.
My twins work Brighton on a sunny day
They cover town with the shake of a hand
On a high come back coz of no come back
Now they're working in the promised land.
Ooh, what a pair of naughty boys
Ooh, I've been a naughty boy
(The Allied Irish Cyprus Bank)
(India Bank Bank of Turkey)
(United Bank The People's Bank)
(To catch the worm you got to be up early)
Temporarily out of bounds had to move office
Clear out of town
For every problem there's a solution and
I can do without constitution
Dealing cards from up the Old Kent Road
I've been checked up on my heavy load
You can go but be back soon
I'll have some work for you to groom.
Ooh, what a lot of naughty boys
Ooh, I've been a naughty boy
(Trustees Bank, Barclays Bank)
(The Natwest Bank, Midland Bank)
(Bank Of Scotland, Williams and Glyns)
(Bureau de Change, The People's Bank)
Ooh, what a lot of naughty boys
Ooh, what a pair of naughty boys
Ooh, what a firm of naughty boys
Ooh, I've been a naughty boy
