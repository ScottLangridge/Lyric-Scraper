(Smyth/Barson)
Trying hard, I thought I'd done my best
All my life, I can't get no rest
Some who've closed the door before
Say I can't carry on no more.
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day
I hear them saying
And it gets better every day
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day
Listened long, tried to take it in
All these facts leave me in the swim
It's down and down there is no up
I think that I've run out of luck.
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day
I hear them saying
And it gets better every day
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day
Tomorrow's just another... Day
Walking now, over covered ground
There is a chance if I move around
I need a moment to reflect
On the friendships I have wrecked.
Why is it I(???) don't I always try?
I hear them say
Tomorrow's just another day
I hear them say
And it gets better every day
I hear them say
Tomorrow's just another day
I hear them say
And it gets better every day
I heard them say
Tomorrow's just another day
I hear them say
Tomorrow's just another day
Tomorrow's just another...
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day
I hear them saying
And it gets better every day
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day
...
