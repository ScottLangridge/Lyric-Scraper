I've never had much cause for worry
And I've not got a lot to say
You'll never find me in a hurry
Because I live my life day by day
People say that I'm crazy
But I'm not that way inclined
I know what I know and I'll happily show
That madness is all in the mind
Twenty-four hours is all that I care for
I believe that's the only way
Twenty-four hours is all that is needed
Because I live my life day by day
People say that I'm crazy
But I'm not that way inclined
I know what I know and I'll happily show
That madness is all in the mind
I'm happy the way that I do things
Continually feeling okay
I've no worries on what tomorrow brings
Because I live my life day by day
People say that I'm crazy
But I'm not that way inclined
I know what I know and I'll happily show
That madness is all in the mind
Well some men seek answers in bottles
And others in degenerate ways
But I don't care much for the question
Madness is all in the mind
Madness is all in the mind
Madness is all in the mind
Madness is all in the mind
