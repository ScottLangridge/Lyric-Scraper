You're My Dream Girl

Baby I'm Your Dream Girl

My special toy I'm your dream girl
The way I walk the way I look
Baby I'm your dream girl

When I'm dreaming I'm alone with you
Lying in my lonely bed
All the times you held me in your arms
And all the fantasies we shared
No on'es touched my body like you do
Not in that special way
Cos' I've found your love, and it feels so right
So don't let me go

Baby I'm your dream girl

I rock your world I'm your dream girl
Believe me babe it's true I wanna be with you
The way I walk the way I look
Hands all over me baby I'm your dream girl

I rock your world I'm your dream girl
Believe me babe it's true I wanna be with you
The way I walk the way I look
Hands all over me baby I'm your dream girl

"You're My Dream"

When you hold me in your arms
You make me feel so safe
Everyone told me to walk away
But don't you see why I stayed
No one's touched my body like you do
Not in that special way
Cos' I've found your love, and it feels so right
So don't let me go

"Drop The Bass"

I rock your world I'm your dream girl
Believe me babe it's true I wanna be with you
The way I walk the way I look
Hands all over me baby I'm your dream girl

I rock your world I'm your dreamgirl
Believe me babe it's true I wanna be with you
The way I walk the way I look
Hands all over me baby I'm your dream girl
