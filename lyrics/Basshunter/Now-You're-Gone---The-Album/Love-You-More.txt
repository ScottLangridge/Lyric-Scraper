You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the seeds unfertile
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

"Everybody In The House Come On"

"Bass In Your Face"

You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the seeds unfertile
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

Wow!

Let the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more
