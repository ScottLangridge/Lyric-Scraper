It's a saturday night
Nothing will go wrong
But if it does, do I care?
I just know how to run
It's a saturday night
And I hope to believe
My heart is calling your name
So hear me out when I say

I can see it in her eyes
When she turns to me and smiles
Everything feels so right
Until the morning light

I can see it in her eyes
When she turns to me and smiles
Everything feels so right
Until the morning light

It's a saturday night
Nothing will go wrong
But if it does, do I care?
I just know how to run
It's a saturday night
And I hope to believe
My heart is calling your name
So hear me out when I say

I can see it in her eyes
When she turns to me and smiles
Everything feels so right
Until the morning light

"Are You Ready"

I can see it in her eyes
