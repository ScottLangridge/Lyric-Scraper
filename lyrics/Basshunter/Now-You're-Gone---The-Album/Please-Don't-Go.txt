Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go

Babe, I love you so
And I, I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

Please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay

[Please don't go]

[Are you ready]

Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go

Babe, in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you

Please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay

[Ready for take off]

Please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay

[Repeat]

Please don't go
