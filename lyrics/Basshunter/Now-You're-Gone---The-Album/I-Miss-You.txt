I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

I can't sleep, I just can't breathe,
When your shadow is all over me
Don't wanna be a fool in your eyes,
When all we had was built on lies

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

I miss you

"Aaaa..."
"Aaaa..." I miss you

What would it take, for you to see,
To make you understand that I will always believe
You and I, can make it through,
You still know I can't get over you

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

Cos' when our love, fades away
Listen to me hear what I say

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

I don't wanna feel
The way that I do
I just wanna be
Right here with you
I don't wanna see
See us apart
I just want to tell you straight from my heart

"Aaaa..." I miss you

I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel the way I do
