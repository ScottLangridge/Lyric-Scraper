Just because you're nobody
It doesn't mean that you're no good
Just because there's a reason
It doesn't mean it's understood

It doesn't make it alright
It doesn't make it alright
It's the worst excuse in the world
And it, it doesn't make it alright

Some people think they're really clever
To smash your head against the wall
Then they say "you got it my way"
They really think they know it all

It doesn't make it alright
It doesn't make it alright
It's the worst excuse in the world
And it, it doesn't make it alright

Just because you're a black boy
Just because you're a white
It doesn't mean you've got to hate him
It doesn't mean you've got to fight

It doesn't make it alright
It doesn't make it alright
It's the worst excuse in the world
And it, it doesn't make it alright

Just because you're nobody!
