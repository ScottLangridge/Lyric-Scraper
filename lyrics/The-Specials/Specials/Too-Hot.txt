Spoken: Boy me a' fie go leave that town here ya know Because it too hot.
Too hot, this town is too hot Now they're calling for their guns About to
Spoil the rude boys funs But rude boys never give up
their guns It's too hot.
No man, can tell them what to do Pound for pound, they say they ruder than
You They all hot, and over town You might
have a couple you like Choose your burial site Make insurance make up your
Will Come out and tell them, fight them.
(guitar solo)
The soldiers came back to you without them The police force are afraid they
Can't even touch them They said you think
you're bad Why don't you come out yourself These boys are spoiling for a
Fight Fighting tonight, they don't lie It's too hot.
Too hot Too hot (repeat till end)
