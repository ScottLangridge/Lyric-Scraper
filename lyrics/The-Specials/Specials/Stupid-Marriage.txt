Court in session.
What do you mean
'Oy oy oy'? Must have court in session.
Order. My name is Judge Roughneck,
And I will not tolerate any disobedience in my courtroom.
Rude boy, you have been brought in
Front of me and charged
With smashing this woman's window.
Before I sentence you,
What have you got to say in your defense?

I was walking down the street one night
When I saw her silhouette in her bathroom light
Her way of life may be nothing to hide
With her frosted glass shattered, curtains open wide

Naked woman, naked man,
Where did you get that nice sun tan?
You live in a castle built of sand
Naked woman, naked man...

Naked from your bath,
You go naked to your bed
And I can't stop the hatred
Running through my head

Silence in court. Order.
Rude boy, you have led me to believe
That you was going out with a girl,
And she left you and married someone else.
So you got drunk,
And smashed up your ex-girlfriend's property.
I have come to one conclusion,
That is to sentence you to five months in prison.
Before they take you down to the cells,
What have you got to say for yourself?

He wanted to be something but she knows he never will
She's got him where she wanted
And forgot to take her pill
And he thinks that
She'll be happy when she's hanging out the nappies
If that's a happy marriage
I'd prefer to be unhappy!

Married woman, married man...
Where did you get that family plan?
Mrs. Ewe and Mr. Ram
Where did you get that lovely lamb?

Naked woman, naked man,
where did you get that nice sun tan?
(Order in my courtroom)
Naked woman, naked man,
where did you get that nice sun tan?
(Hush up)
Naked woman, naked man,
where did you get that nice sun tan?
(Take him away)
