Snow is falling all around, seven o'clock and the roads are blocked
So I walk down town, there's no-one around

I walk in a bar and immediately I sense danger
You look at me girl as if I was some kind of a, a total stranger
(Where) Where did you get that (Blank) blank expression on your face?
(Where) Where did you get that (Blank) blank expression on your face?

The streets are dark, and there's no-one about
I wander home and all the, the lights are out, I keep wondering
(Where) Where did you get that (Blank) blank expression on your face?
(Where) Where did you get that (Blank) blank expression on your face?
(Where) Where did you get that (Blank) blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
