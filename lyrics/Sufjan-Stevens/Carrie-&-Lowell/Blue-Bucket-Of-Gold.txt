My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why dont you love me?
Once the myth has been told
The lens deforms it as lightning

[Hook]
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life

Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me
My blue bucket of gold
Lord, touch me with lightning

[Hook]
