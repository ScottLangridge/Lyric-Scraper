If I was a different man, if I had blood in my eyes
I could have read of your heart, I could have read of your mind
But now I'm lonely as that, I put up a fight
So pick up your battering ram, love, I want to see it

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that anyway

Maybe I talk too fast, maybe I talk too much
Give me the sensitive laugh, or give me the sensitive touch
Even if I could have kissed, even if I could be the blind
I'm so sorry I tried, love, I want to see it

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that anyway

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that
There's too much, too much, too much love

There's too much riding on that anyway

There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
