(Difford/Tilbrook)

There she sits in an empty room
The look on her face says it all
A bruise appears round a crying eye
As the tear drops sadly fall
He knocked her over he hit her
And told her she's stupid
He's high as a kite once again
She knows that tough love is needed
To save the love of her friend

There he sits in a freezing car
She's in her bed in the warm
The cold light of the morning sky
Finds him cramped and looking worn
He wanders inside on tiptoes
And brews up some coffee
He's shaking and sweating again
She knows that tough love is needed
To save the love of her friend

They talk it over but it's not easy
Sorting it out
She cannot take it when he tells lies
And sneaks off out of the room
Returning like somebody's lost balloon

Tea leaves sit in an empty cup
No expression on his face
The tv's showing commercials
He's back in her arms again
No more the drugs and the drinking
Her heart can stop sinking
Now that he's home once again
She knows that tough love is needed
To save the love of her friend

They talked it over for hours and hours and hours
'Till everything sounded the same
She knows it's tough love that she finds in her heart
To dissolve the pain
