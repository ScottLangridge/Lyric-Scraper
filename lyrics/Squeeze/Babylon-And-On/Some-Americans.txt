(difford/tilbrook)

Some americans are very pretty
Some americans are very shy
Some americans are disney people
Some americans eat apple pie
Some americans scare me, the leader of the pack
Living in this theatre
I'm waiting for the trap to drop in the show
Some americans gung ho

Some americans are very happy
Some americans will always win
Some americans are party people
Some americans go out and sing

Some americans are very lucky
Some americans are very poor
Some americans are burger people
Some americans say no to war
