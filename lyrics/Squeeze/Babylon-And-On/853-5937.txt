(Difford/tilbrook)

853-5937
Angela can't make it to the phone
If you care to leave your name and number
She'll give you a ring when she is home

Every time I called her I got the message
I listened to the voice coming down the line
I couldn't speak to a tape recording
I redialed it a number of times

(Chorus:)
853-5937
Angela can't make it to the phone
If you care to leave your name and number
Please speak clearly after the tone
She'll give you a ring when she gets home

I rang her this morning so very early
The same old message coming down the phone
I should go and see if her house is empty
Maybe she's poorly perhaps she's not home

(Chorus)

She's in mill hill I'm in bermondsey
It's the end of the earth on the northern line
It makes it so hard for me to see
The one that I love but can never find.

I called up a close friend who lives right by her
I got the message he was out too
I got suspicious, are they together
I've got to find out that this isn't true

(Chorus)
