(Difford/tilbrook)

I've returned
I've returned

Last night I played the drunken fiddle
Disabled love with a word of dribble
On and on about some jumbled subject
I Said your friends were a bunch of muppets
I Said your sister should have grown a moustache
Said you didn't need to take off your mask
Down the staircase I made my stagger
I left you crying but it didn't matter

So I sat inside my car and wonder
A headache in my head like the thunder
I Chewed my nails like a guilty victim
I Couldn't see or feel the night or nothing
I Wanted to explain but all so desperate
Love was like it was some investment
Then I don't remember who said what when
On a scrap of paper I placed my pen

When I woke up in the morning
Beside you in the bed
My mouth was full of nothing
My arms around your head
I don't know how I got there
But I didn't want to check
Now back between each other
We're salvaging our wreck
Now I've returned

You've thrown my jigsaw all over the floor
We're at the deepest deep
I thought our love had died forever
But it just went to sleep

I've returned
I've returned
I've returned
I've returned
