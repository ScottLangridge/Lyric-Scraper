Well you'd better not tell I've had a good night
Me and this bird she's a bit of alright
Dancing to the sounds as the arches get searched
She is the business for a bit of old skirt
It's so dirty when it's in the right mood
Give it some brandy and some chinese food
Take her for a spin in your stereo jag
Tell her she's the best girl you've ever had
Give it some gold to put round it's neck
Then her old man puts you on the deck
But it's so dirty with me - it so dirty with me
It's so dirty with me - it's so dirty with me

Well you'd better watch out here comes a tornado
You'll end up looking like a mashed potato
If her old man gets word of what's going on here
You'll end up at the bottom of someone's next beer

Well I've got a bud ain't frightened by shooters
So lets have a drink for a couple of troopers
No her old man won't know I've been giving it some
Less you tell him the news but we know that ain't done
