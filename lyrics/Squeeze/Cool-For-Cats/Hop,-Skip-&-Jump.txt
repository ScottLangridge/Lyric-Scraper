I wan't nervous when I got this date
I went along to investigate
She turned out to look like me *(see note)
I stood up and gave her the seat
I'm so infatuated
Seemed like it's complicated
I was helpless and I was sober
She cracked her whip and knocked me over
She made me hop skip and jump
'm 'm 'm my baby's love
With a hop skip and jump
She's a pretty one
When you're sitting in you seat
With her hand on your knees
She makes you hop, skip and jump

She's got spice, she stops traffic
She's got her very special magic
I wasn't nervous, I was shaking
She needed no investigating
She made me hop skip and jump
'm 'm 'm my baby's love
With a hop skip and jump
She's a pretty one
When you're sitting in you seat
With her hand on your knees
She makes me
