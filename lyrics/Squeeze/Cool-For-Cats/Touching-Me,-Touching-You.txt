I'm always touching myself
I've got nothing else to do
And when I'm touching myself
I'm always thinking of you
Touching me, touching you
I've got nothing else to do
Chorus
Touching, touching you
Touching, touching me
Here, there and in my hair
And when you touch me

I'm always playing around
Eyes closed, neatly occupied
And when I'm playing around
I think of all the things I like
Touching me, touching you
I've got nothing else to do

Chorus
