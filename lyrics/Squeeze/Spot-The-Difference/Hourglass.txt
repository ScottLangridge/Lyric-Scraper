(Difford/Tilbrook)

I feel like I'm pounding on a big door
No one can hear me knocking
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor
No one can catch me from falling
The hourglass has no more grains of sand
My watch has stopped no more turning hands
The crew have abandoned ship
The lights are on but no one is in
Take it to the bridge
Throw it overboard
See if it can swim
Back up to the shore
No one's in the house
Everyone is out
All the lights are on
And the blinds are down

I feel like I'm calling on a telephone
No one can hear the ringing
I feel like I'm running up a steep hill
No one can stop me from running
The hourglass has no more grains of sand
My watch has stopped no more turning hands
The little hand shakes it's fist
The face is hanging out on a spring

The hourglass has no more grains of sand
Little red grains of sand
My watch has stopped no more turning hands
Little green neon hands
