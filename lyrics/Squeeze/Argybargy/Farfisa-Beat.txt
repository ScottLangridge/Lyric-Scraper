(difford/tilbrook)

Everybody's dancing
To the farfisa beat
All the girls are crazy
Acting out the heat
Tie and shirts and cufflinks
Well that's pretty neat
Flash flash mirror ball
Stereo and disco
Wow wow ain't she tall
Moved off my feet
To the farfisa beat

Pulling my side glances
To the one across the way
She wears a lot of makeup
But they all do these days
Pretty horny tee shirt
Well mighten you explain

Beat for beat for beat for all
Cut there in the yea
Everybody's got the girl
So is there any spare
For five foot seven
Of heavy duty wear
