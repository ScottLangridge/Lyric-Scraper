It was a hot and steamy night,
Then frankie pulled his gun in sight.
He said, "now suzi, don't you lie.
Did stevey, did he catch you with another guy? "
Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.
Standing in the line of fire it's comin' to ya,
It's goin' through ya.


He told her that he had been true,
And that he'd never made her blue, no.
So don't go sayin' stevey's a liar,
Girl, I've got my finder on a hair-trigger wire.


Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.
Standing in the line of fire it's comin' to ya,
It's goin' through ya.
Bye, bye, bye, suzi.
So long girl.


Those gunshots echoed through the town.
Oh frankie threw his shotgun down.
That roof had moonlight shinin' through.
She said she'd never, never, never, make him blue, yea.


Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.
Standing in the line of fire it's comin' to ya,
Standing in the line of fire it's gonna shoot ya.
It's goin' through ya.
Bye, bye, bye, suzi.
So long.
