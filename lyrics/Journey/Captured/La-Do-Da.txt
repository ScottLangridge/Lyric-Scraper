Something about you baby
Really knocks me off my feet
Something about you sweetheart
Brings this poor boy to his knees

La, do, da, do, da
La, do, da, do, da, do, da

Something about you baby
Whey you touch me sweet so fine
I feel it, I feel it
When your body's close to mine

La, do, da, do, da
La, do, da, do, da, do, da
