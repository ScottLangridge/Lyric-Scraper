Winter is here, again, Oh Lord
Haven't been home in a year or more
I hope she holds on a little longer
Sent a letter on a long summer day
Made of silver, not of clay
Ooh I've been runnin' down this dusty road

The wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'

I've been trying to make it home
Got to make it, before to long
Ooh, I can't take this very much longer, no
I'm stranded, in the sleet and rain
Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again
The Mornin' sun is risin'
It's kissin' the day

Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Wohohohohohohoh For tomorrow

Oh the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Ooh I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps me yernin'
Ooh I don't know I don't know

Oh the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin
Ooh I Don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Wheel in the sky keeps turnin'
Ooh I don't know I don't know I don't knowohoh
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
Don't know where I'll be tomorrow
Ooh the wheel in the ske keeps on turnin
Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
