When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Do I want to be there in my City
Ooh, ooh


So you think you're lonely
Well my friend I'm lonely too
I want to get back to my City by the bay
Ooh, ooh


It's sad, oh there's been mornings out on the road without you,
Without your charms,
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my

When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Do I want to be there in my City
Ooh, ooh

When the lights go down in the City
And the sun shines on the bay
Do I want to be there in my City
Ooh, ooh
