I've been thinking 'bout the times you walked out on me
There were moments I'd believe, you were there
Do I miss you, or am I lying to myself again
I do these things (it's all because of you)
I keep holding on, but I'll try (try not to think of you)
Love don't leave me lonely

I'll be alright without you - there'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself
I'll be alright without you - oh, love's an empty face, I can't replace
(you don't need it)

People wondrin' why we broke apart, the great pretender here I go again
These things I do (it's all because of you)
I'll keep holdin' on, but I'll try (try not to think of you)
All I wanted was to hold you

I'll be alright without you - there'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself
I'll be alright without you - love's an empty face, oh I've got to replace

I'll be alright without you - there'll be someone else, I keep tellin' myself
I'll be alright without you - oh, love's an empty place
I can still see your face (I'll be alright)
