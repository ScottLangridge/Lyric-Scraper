It's been a mystery and still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one way street the taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

Chorus:
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

So many stormy nights, so many wrongs or rights
Neither could change their headstrong ways
And in a lovers rage they tore another page
The fightin is worth the love they save...

Repeat chorus

Only so many tears you can cry
Til the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

Repeat chorus
