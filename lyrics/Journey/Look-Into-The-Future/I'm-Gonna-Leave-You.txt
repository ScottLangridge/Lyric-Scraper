Hi sweetz!

Journey: Bonus Track

Baby I'm A-Leavin' You

You know that my heart is true
And I'd never lie to you
We try each and every day
Still there's something in the way

I like moonlight, simple things
Now you want a diamond ring
I got news for you
Baby I'm a-leaving you

We both want a love that lasts
Girl, you're moving away too fast
I live for your fantasy
A real love is what I need

You should be happy, tell you friends
This is where the movie ends
I got news for you
Baby I'm a-leaving you

Let me tell you, girl
I hear what you say, I see what you're doing, girl
I don't wanna play

We're livin' in two different worlds

Tell me girl it ain't true
The rumors that I hear about you
'Bout all the boys you knew before
Who come and go right out your door

I like moonlight, simple things
Go out and get a diamond ring
I got news for you
Baby I'm a-leaving you
Oh, baby I'm a-leaving you

I got news for you...

Bye Sugarnuts!
