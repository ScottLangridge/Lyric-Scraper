City of the angels
City of the angels
Walkin' and talkin' and laughin' about
Dreamin' the things that you want will work out
People in places where you want to be
I'm lost in the city
Who's got the key
City of the angels
Ooh, I hear you callin' me
City of the angels
I've got this feelin' that things will work out
I've got this feelin', and there ain't no doubt
I'm holding on, hoping to find
Life in this city can bring peace of mind
City of the angels
Ooh, I hear you callin' me
City of the angels
City of the angels
Oh, I hear you callin' me
City of the angels
Just like, just like it used to be, yes
City of the angels
I'm goin' home, home
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Yeah, yeah, I'm leavin'
Oh, oh, I'm goin home
My friend I'm leavin'
