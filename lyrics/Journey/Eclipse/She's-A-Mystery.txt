[Verse:]: Cascades of gentle touch,
Her passion blinding my eyes
I find I lose myself drowning from he colorful sky
I'm aware of her grace... Those careless kisses
[Chorus:]: Tattooed on a sacred place, she's a mystery (she's mine)
Wondering if she loves me; she's a mystery (so fine) She's a sweet
Confusion
[Verse:]: She's my zen, my own, my only Shangri-la
She's my French champagne, she's my ooh la la
(Repeat Chorus)
[Verse:]: Like a gentle wind she moves, her fascination I desire
She's a butterfly, she's a Mona Lisa smile
(Repeat chorus)
I can hold her tight
Yet she's free to fly in and out of my life
She's a mystery
