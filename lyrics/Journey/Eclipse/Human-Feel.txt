In a jungle of hardware and mass frustration,
Overloaded with way too much information these days.
I'm needing more than the virtual world I'm seeing.
Could someone just let me talk to a live human being?

While automation and droids just keep on coming,
I wanna unplug right now, I want to just start running.
Caught up in the web as it weaves an illusion,
A network of lies that giant ball of confusion.

What we're missing is true emotion,
I get lost in this digital ocean.
What I'm needing right now is human feel.

Can't substitute love and passion.
Show me you care, baby show me reaction.
Coming straight from the heart, It's human feel.

Rise up, find some compassion,
It's not too late.
Don't give up,
What you feel still matters, don't wait.

Make it real, keep it real, human feel.
Show me reaction, don't wait.
What we're missing is true emotion.
I get lost in this digital ocean.
What I'm needing right now is human feel.

Can't substitute love and passion.
Show me you care, baby show me reaction.
Coming straight from the heart, It's human feel.

Rise up, find some compassion right now.
Don't give up,.
Show me reaction, don't wait.
Rise up.
Make it real.
Make it human feel.
Rise up.
Oh. Rise up.
Rise up.
Make it real.
Make it human feel.
Rise up.
Rise up.
Rise up.
