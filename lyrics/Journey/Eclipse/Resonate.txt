When I'm alone I keep replaying the look of love in your eyes.
When I miss home I swear I die every time we said goodbye.
Like a gentle wind you cross my mind.
I lose myself I lose all sense of time.

Feel your presence all around me
On the same frequency.
It's all our love can be when we
Resonate... Resonate

Even though we're miles apart
I reach for you and there you are.
You bow the strings that move my heart.
Resonate... Resonate.

You come to me your in my dreams.
You are my satellite.
You make me feel sweet vibrations.
We've shared endless nights.

Think of me, I'm never far away...
I hear your voice... You call my name.

Feel your presence all around me
On the same frequency.
It's all our love can be when we
Resonate... Resonate

Even though we're miles apart.
I reach for you and there you are.
You bow the strings that move my heart.
Resonate... Resonate

Feel the distance, send a message every night
Finding each other, we share the same desire.
Like a telegraph that leads straight to your heart.
I reach out and love is where you are.

Feel your presence all around me,
It's all our love can be...

Feel your presence all around me
On the same frequency
It's all our love can be when we
Resonate... Resonate

Even though we're miles apart.
I reach for you and there you are.
You bow the strings that move my heart.
Resonate... Resonate
