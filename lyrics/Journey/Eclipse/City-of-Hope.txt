People waiting for some kind of sign from above,
Lost in the shadows of doubt, need a message of love,
Nothing is certain in uncertain times,
Hard to see beyond the greed and the crime,
Oh, the faithful refuse to give up,
Homeless and hungry survive just enough,
Learn to smile through it all,
They are blessed from above

Never stop believin,
Change will come

There's a city of hope beyond our fears,
Where miracles happen,
Where truth can be heard,
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope

On the edge of the world, across oceans of blue,
It's a place where a dream has a chance to come true,
Don't be fooled by illusions, or falling from grace,
Make your own destiny
Find your own place,
Where the streets beat the last things of trouble over own play

Never stop believ'n,
Change will come

There's a city of hope beyond our fears,
Where miracles happen,
Where truth can be heard,
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope

Founded on faith,
Connecting us all,
A network of love to answer the call,
Yeah, that's where I am from
The city of hope

I hear them whisper, "Sendin a prayer,"
A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder

Never stop believin,
Change will come

There's a city of hope beyond our fears,
Where miracles happen,
Where truth can be heard,
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope
