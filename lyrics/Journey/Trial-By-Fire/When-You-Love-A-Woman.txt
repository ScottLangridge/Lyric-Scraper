In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searchin' ain't over... Over
I know that

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting
Somewhere... Oh oh yeah

If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl
Yes I know I... I know that

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines, waiting
Somewhere... Oh.. Oh

It's enough to make you cry.
When you see her walkin' by
And you look into her eyes

Oh... Oh... Oh

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
Well you know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever

There's a band of gold that shines... Whoa
When you love a woman...
When you love, love, love
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes.
