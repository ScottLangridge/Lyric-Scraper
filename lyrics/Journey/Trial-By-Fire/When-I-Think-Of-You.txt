Magic... Moments
There're the things I will remember
Where's the time we spent together... Laughing
Then you walk into my dream... Dear

And I see your face
Young and so free, smiling at me
So long since i've... Had you near

Now you've come back again
Where the love never ends
And you're right here
When I think of you

When i... Need you, I just close my eyes
And you're... Here
Right beside me when I'm lost in... Shadows
Of the memories of you... Oh my dear

And I see your face
Young and so free, smiling at me
In your eyes I walk without fear
We're together again
Where the love never ends
'cause you're right here
When I think of you

Hold on... Just for a while
Hold on... Hold on

I try to forget the night that you left
It's all so unreal, with you gone
I can dream once again...
Where the love never ends
'cause you're right here
When I think of you
When I think of you
When I think of you
