I, walk alone in the dark, with you
And deep, in the shadows I run, without you
And here, here I stand, the king of fools
Now love's here, where are you
Baby can you hear me
Can you hear me callin'
Baby can you hear my
Message of love
Baby can you hear me
Can you hear me callin',
Baby can you hear my
Message of love
Why, have I waited so long to be there... For you
Now, now I'm ready to give everything... To you
Now love's here, where are you
Baby can you hear me callin',
Baby you hear my
Message of love
Baby can you hear me
Can you hear me callin',
Baby can you hear my
Message of love
I hear... But I never listen
I see... And still I'm blind
All alone... Lost in the silence, I'm dyin'
Baby can you hear me
Can you hear me callin',
Baby can you hear my
Message of love
Baby can you hear me
Can you hear me callin',
Baby can you hear my
Message of love
Message... Do you, do you. Do you hear me
Do you hear my message
Baby can you hear me callin', callin'
Do you, do you hear me
