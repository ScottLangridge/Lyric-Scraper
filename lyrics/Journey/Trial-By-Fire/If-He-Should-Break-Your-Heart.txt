Please be wrong
Please don't tell me it's really you
Tell me eyes... Tell my heart what I'm goin' through
I believed, I believed I was over you

If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should fall... Apart
I'll be there, I'll be around
If he should break... Your heart
I'll be there

Is this right
I don't care I'm alone with you
Here we are, once again you've got someone new
Lonely hands, please don't do what you wanna do

If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should fall... Apart
I'll be there, I'll be around

If he should break... Your heart
From my soul I say... Good-bye yesterday
One more night alone, without the touch... Of you
Then I start to break... Is it my mistake
Tell me am I wrong... For holdin' on... To you

If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should fall... Apart
I'll be there, I'll be around

If he should break you heart, I'll be there
If he should break your, if he should break your
If he should break your heart
I'll be there, I'll be around
