Oh yeah
Progress flys, into our lives
Got to find time, find time
Talk digit talk
You're doin' find
Machines never mind
They never mind

Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the heroes
Have gone east of eden
We all need new frontiers

Ooh it's a 3d rise
All tech-na-ca-jive
Talk a video dive
War is for fools
Crisis is cool
Barbarians play

[Chorus:]

New, new, frontiers
Barbarians play away, away, away... Play
