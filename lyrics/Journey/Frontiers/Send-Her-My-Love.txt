It's been so long
Since I've seen her face
You say she's doin' fine
I still recall a sad cafe
How it hurt so bad to see her cry
I didn't want to say goodbye

Chorus:
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love

The same hotel
The same old room
I'm on the road again
She needed so much more
Than I could give
We knew our love could not pretend
Broken hearts can always mend

Chorus

Callin' out her name I'm dreamin'
Reflections of a face I'm seein'
It's her voice
That keeps on haunting me

Send her, send her my love
Roses never fade
Memories remain
Send her, send her, my love...
