Wait a minute baby, stay with me a while
Said you'd give me light but you never told me about the fire

Drowning in the sea of love where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone, it doesn't matter what for
When you build your house then call me, 'Home"

And he was just like a great dark wing, within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match, he was singing and undoing and undoing the laces, undoing the laces

Said, "Sara, you're the poet in my heart, never change, never stop"
But now it's gone, it doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house, well then call me, "Home"

Hold on, the night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay at home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'll be, ask me and I'll be, 'cause I care

In the sea of love where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone, they say, "It doesn't matter anymore"
If you build your house then please call me, "Home"
Sara, you're the poet in my heart, never change and don't you ever stop
Now it's gone, no, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house, I'll come by (Now it's gone, (Sara), now it's gone, now it's gone, (Sara), now it's gone)
(Crazy, well, but there's a heartbeat that never really died, they said, it never really died, (Sara))
(Oh would you swallow all your pride, would you speak a little louder (Sara))
(Singing, "All I ever wanted was to know that you were dreaming")
