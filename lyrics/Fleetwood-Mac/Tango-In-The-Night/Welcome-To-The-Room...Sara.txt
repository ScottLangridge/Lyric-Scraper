It's not home and it's not Tara
In fact do I know you?
Have I been here before?
This is a dream, right?
Deja Vu, did I come here on my own?
Oh I see

Welcome to the room Sara for Scarlett
Welcome to the choir, sir

Ooh, missionary
Well I will be different when I get back
And you can take all of the credit
You say everything's fine, baby but sometimes at night

Where the first cut is the deepest one of all
(Scarlett)
(The first cut is the deepest one of all)
And the second one
Well it's a worthless thing, so
Take it all the way back home, take it home

Ooh, downstairs where the big old house is mine
Ohh, upstairs where the stars laugh and shine
Oh, oh well I thought that you were mine
Well I thought that you were mine
  (You were mine)

Welcome to the room Sara, Sara
  (For Scarlett)
Welcome to the choir, sir
Well of course it was a problem
(For Scarlett)
Front line baby

Well you held her prisoner and after all these years
Well as well as you knew her
  (Welcome)
In the never forgotten words of another one of your friends
In the never forgotten words of another one of your friends, baby

When you hang up that phone
Well you cease to exist
Welcome to the room Sara, welcome
Welcome to the room
