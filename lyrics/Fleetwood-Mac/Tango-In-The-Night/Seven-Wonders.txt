So long ago, certain place, certain time
You touched my hand, all the way, all the way down to Emmiline
But if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but...
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end

So it's hard to find someone with that kind, that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool and you reached out your hand for me
But if our paths never cross, well you know I'm sorry but...
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end

(Never)
(Never)
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled, all the way back you held out your hand
If I hope and if I pray, ooh it might work out someday
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (Well I make a path, path)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see the beauty, that beauty, that same, same beauty again)
If I live to see the seven wonders (If I live to see that)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again (Well if I hope and I pray, well maybe it might work out someday)
If I live to see
