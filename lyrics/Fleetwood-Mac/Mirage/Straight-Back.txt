Words and Music by Stevie Nicks
what can I say this time
which card shall I play
the dream is not over
the dream is just away
and you will fly like some little wing
straight back to the sun
the dream was never over
the dream has just begun
the dream has just begun......... Dream....
My fingers find the ivory keys
ans a song begins to begin
like a wolf... On the run
and you will find
while in the wind
something that you lost
the dream was never over... No...
The dream was only lost
(hours and hours of waiting for you, so strong and so fleeting)
the dream has just begun
(and hours of waiting for you... In hopes of meeting)
the dream has just begun
(meeting this way)
well, the dream has just begun!
She remembers how good it can be...
He remembers a melody....
Ah... In the shadow of my shadow.... In a gleam...
He remembers how good it can be....
She remembersa melody.....
Well... In the shadow of my shadow.... In a dream... Whoa....
(hours and hours of waiting for you... So strong and so fleeting)
the dream has just begun
(hours and hours of waiting this way... Meeting me...)
and hours of waiting for you
(so strong and so fleeting)
the dream has just begun
(I'm tired of meeting this way)
straight back now
(hours and hours of waiting... So strong and so fleeting)
hours and hours of waiting this way
hours and hours of waiting this way
straight back
straight back
straight back...... Yeah!!
He remembers a melody...
He remembers how good it can be...
Straight back
straight back
straight back...... Yeah!!
