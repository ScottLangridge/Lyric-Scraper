Go on save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why
You know the answer
If she's so willing, little one
There was no chance there

I have come to know
This world of changing faces
I can't fight the world
I can't change it
So be true to me
My walls are flaming
If she's so willing, little one
I won't be staying

Ahhh
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can

I am older now
But I still remember
I took the greatest fall
I can't accept her
So be true to me
My walls are flaming
If she's so willing, little one
I won't be staying

Ahhh
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can

What you did not need was a woman
Who was stronger
You needed someone to depend on you
I could not be her
I did not want to
My first mistake was to smile at you
Smile at you

Go on save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here
Don't ask me why
You know the answer
If she's so willing, little one
There was no chance there

Ahhh
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can
Turned away and ran
I should have turned away and ran
As fast as I can
Just as fast as I can

Go on save yourself
Leave the key here
You love someone else
I shouldn't be here

Go on save yourself
Go on save yourself
I shouldn't be here
I shouldn't be here
