Something in you brought out something in me that I've never been since.
That part of me that was only for you, that kind of romance
Comes Only Once that kind of love, that kind of fever dance
That you love because you become someone else in an instant

Say you will, say you will
Give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance

Something in you put a hold on my heart
Hard to believe now
Here is a place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That kind of touch
Electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else in an instant

Say you will, say you will
Give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance
