Music and lyrics by Lindsey Buckingham

Why do you come around?
So very much
You know it just brings you down
It's just something you can touch

You don't belong here
I guess you never did
Whisper "murder" in your ear
You just keep it so well hid

Anyone at all
Could see what was missin'
Could see you were dyin'
Though no one was cryin'

And the lips you were kissing
Night after night
All were bathed in blue
All were bathed in white

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover
We come, we come, we come, we come
To take you over
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over

One of the quiet ones
One of the few
Now fall down onto your knees
Show us all what you can do

We came around here
To see if you were well
And there's nothing for you to fear
In Heaven or in Hell

Anyone at all
Could see what was missin'
Could see you were dyin'
Though no one was cryin'

And the lips you were kissing
Night after night
All were bathed in blue
All were bathed in white

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover
We come, we come, we come, we come
To take you over
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over
Red rover
Take you over
