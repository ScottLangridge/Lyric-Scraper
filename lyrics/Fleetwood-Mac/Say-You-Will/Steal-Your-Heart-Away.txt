Music and lyrics by Lindsey Buckingham

All alone we go on day after day
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away

It's the same old thing in the same old way
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away

And the light was creepin' down, down, down
While we were sleeping
Suddenly we hit the ground

So come on, lets go, lets run away
If that's all, all there is
Oh, to steal your heart away

Steal your heart away
Steal your heart away

The light was creepin' down, down, down
But we were sleeping
Suddenly we hit the ground

So come on, lets go, lets run away
If that's all, well there is
Oh, to steal your heart away
Oh , to steal your heart away

The lonely suffer (oh to steal your heart away)
The lonely suffer (oh to steal your heart away)
The lonely suffer (oh to steal your heart away)
The lonely suffer (oh to steal your heart away)
The lonely suffer,(oh to steal your heart away, if that's all there is)
The lonely suffer (Is that all there is)
