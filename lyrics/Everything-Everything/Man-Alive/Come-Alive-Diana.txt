Come alive Diana, I don't have time, 
To dig a grave, but I know, 
It's the only option left to me now summer has sucked the stone, 
And burst your tires.

On the shore you found him, 
Warped and wild were his eyes, 
And they shook and they quivered in their sockets 
Like a bullet they ricocheted between your thighs.

Her phantom head! 
Is thinking for all mankind I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes! 
I lost an author, ooh, and then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it, more

Her phantom head, her phantom head

Line the streets Diana, with armored cars, 
Oh column inch, timeless inch,
Can you inch another centimeter closer to hearts and minds? 
You'll win them yet.

And the young Diana, she waves inside a global grief, 
In a wind, gonna pry her, gonna lose her, 
And the patterns emerge like germs, lest we forget.

He told me, he told me

Her phantom head! Is thinking for all mankind 
I saw her portrait in the Mail, 
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes! I lost an author, ooh, 
And then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it, more

They're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell
And I can feel the heat, I can hear the heat, rising for
That Aryan Aryan Aryan knell
And mother looks away, father looks away, for a second

(And her phantom head)
Is rolling around some yard, 
While simultaneously wired

Her phantom head! 
Is thinking for all mankind I saw her portrait in the Mail
Her phantom head was directing the holiest of hunts
I made mistakes! I lost an author, ooh,
And then I lost a daughter's awe
I don't know how you'd affect it, more

Her phantom head, her phantom head, 
Her phantom head, her phantom head,

They're ringing and ringing the Liberty Bell
That Aryan Aryan Aryan knell
