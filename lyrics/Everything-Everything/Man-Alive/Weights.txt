They are, with, terrible weights,
Come with rope to, hold up, 
The bridge, oh, the weights, 
The tiniest weights, grow, to

You did oh, but you did, what you had to, and live alone.

There's a bottle on the
Fire, sleep in cinders add the burden up the weights
Double the weights, double the,
Heaviest of moments, all together now it's
Damn near unconvincing, add the burden up the
Weights, double the weights, double the

Time, to live alone yeah, 
Time, to live alone
You did oh, but you did, 
What you had to, and live alone

I know how it all ends
I know how it all
