Baby gets born, rolls on his back, opens his eyes and
Hears a voice
A-saying oh... 
I'll tell you a secret about yourself, I'll tell you a
Secret about yourself

Your father was bad, his father was bad, his father was
Bad need I go any further on... ?
You not gonna try to involve yourself, your pliable
Head is a walking hope

Cos even now, there's a bone snapping, doughy embryo, 
Bloody hands clapping, the blood is clapping

If all the boys say you did it, and all the girls say
You did it, 
And if all the boys say you did it, and all the girls
Say you did it

Then man, you're as guilty as the ones the came before, 
You sleepwalked over here, the drawbridge creaks
Ignored.
So leave the engine room and go, leave the engine room
And build a road, 
Leave the engine room, the steam will peter out and I'm
Tired of the centuries passing, the vacuum and the womb
And I respect that things have changed and I'm alone
And I remember snatches here, and I involve myself with
Utter madness

Leave me lounging, with my nerves butchered, and the
Ceiling torched, in the birth canal
Cos even now, there's a bomb dropping, it's ever
Dropping

Cos all the boys say I did it, and all the girls say I
Did it, and mother all the boys say I did it, 
And all the girls say I did it

And man, I'm as guilty as the ones that came before.
