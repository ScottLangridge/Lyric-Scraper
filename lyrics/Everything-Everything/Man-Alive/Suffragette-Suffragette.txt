Blitz, you test me, no more
I'm calm, now absent, I'm date-rape yellow, black to
The liver come on

Take my lung, take my loose tongue, take my sum, take
My memory
Of nothing at all, nothing at all is what you remind me
No thread, no lips, no postscripts, no eclipse of my
Liberty
Oh pedigree chum, pedigree chum I'm never your father

Cause you're gonna sit on your fence when I'm gone
Cause you're gonna sit on your fence when I'm not there

More, my arc light, my knees
When she casts off her clothes I don't know what is
Reality

My death throes, this indefinite pose, her flesh codes
(Inconceivable)
Oh suffragette, suffragette I wanna be outlawed and

AWOL
No alphabet can be used yet no cassette is available
Oh I dunno how, I dunno how I'm gonna reset my whole
Radar

(Forget) Cause you're gonna sit on the fence when I'm
Gone
(Forget) Cause you're gonna sit on the fence when I'm
Not there

Cause you're gonna sit on the fence when I'm gone
Cause you're gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there

[Repeat]

(To the back, to the back row)
Of nothing at all, nothing at all is what you remind me
Oh suffragette, suffragette I wanna be outlawed and
AWOL but

Cause you're gonna sit on the fence when I'm gone
Cause you're gonna sit on the fence when I'm not there

[Repeat 6 times]
