I awake in the future, I had turned to stone with fear,
Laid on petrified trees
In a high school massacre I'm fossilized and clear, the
Teenage terrorists freeze
We began dismantling the stadia and schools, singing
Save our simian souls!
Polished up warm bullets hanging static in the air,
Droplets glittering home

Nasa knows, how the pheromones, cascade! Down the
Walls, you can't help the way you feel
You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil, yeah
They're gonna dig a coal-face! Out of you, Isambard I'm
All steel!

Chasing homeless cheerleaders, through the sewers lit
By burning polythene bags
Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight,
For the promenade dance
Fill your locker with an arsenal, hieroglyphic every
Particle, mother all about the coal and the lava and
The gas that we are, lovers on the landfill, digging me

Up to fuel rockets and risk
Look across now honey the horizon, I can see a shuttle
Birth, is it a boy? Or a girl? Or a gun? I know it's
Ludicrous to be lost; there's never been a time like
This

Everyone, is gonna end, up there, you're overcome, but
Nasa is on your side
It's happening, the sky is shattering, and they're
Gonna make a Death Star, out of you, but nasa is on
Your side
Nasa is on your side
Nasa is on your side

Everyone, is gonna end, up there, you're overcome, but
Nasa is on your side
It's happening, yeah, it's happening, and they're gonna
Make a Death Star, out of you, but nasa is on your side

There were children climbing over fridges in a rush to
See the death of the sun
And we laughed all night when they said "treasure in
The sky" and we had nothing but fun
