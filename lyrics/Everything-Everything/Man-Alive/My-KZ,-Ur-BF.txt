Lucifer you're landing 
Cross-hairs on the kitchen sink 
Barb-wire in the
Bathroom 
I can't make new memories since

Flashbacks to the time this
Shell-shocked apartment was the place
I met with your boy
It's a mortal
Thing, yeah it's a mortal thing
Oh! He looked at me funny and a
Oh! Oh! Think
Our secret's out and a
Oh-ooh-oh I try to explain
But then munitions rain,
And we're the epicenter

It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the
Guillotine,
It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the
Guillotine

And I wanna know what happened to your boyfriend
Cos he was
Looking at me like "Whoa!"
Yeah right before the kitchen was a dust bowl
And
Tossing me the keys and I can't forget how
Everything just coming through the
Windows
And half the street was under my nails
It's like we sitting in the
Faraday cage,
When the lights all failed

I fly through the walls
All
Pieces colliding and I
See Raymond apart
He'a a frowning now, wagging a
Finger at me
"Boy!" his knees bend the other way and
"Boy! Boy!" are you guys
Together honey? 
"Boy!" oh but now I can't find his torso, mm hm hm I
Guess you're separated ooh,
Monica I just wanna know, ooh

It's like I'm
Watching the A4 paper taking over the guillotine,
(Monica I just wanna know)
It's like I'm watching the A4 paper taking over the guillotine

And
I wanna know what happened to your boyfriend
Cos he was looking at me like
"Whoa!"
Yeah right before the kitchen was a dust bowl
And tossing me the
Keys and I can't forget how
Everything just coming through the windows
And
Half the street was under my nails
It's like we sitting in the Faraday
Cage,
When the lights all failed

Lucifer you're landing 
(Six cars the driveway oh I do believe it will be business inside)
Cross-hairs on the
Kitchen sink 
(It's a real spanner into my works I think I kicked the bucket)
Baby's on the bulls eye 
(Do believe it will be business inside)
I
Can't make new memories since, ries since, ries since.

And I wanna know
What happened to your boyfriend
Cos he was looking at me like "whoa!"
Yeah
Right before the kitchen was a dust bowl
And tossing me the keys and I can't
Forget how
Everything just coming through the windows
And half the street was
Under my nails
It's like we sitting in the Faraday cage,
When the lights all
Failed

And now everybody gotta go hungry
And everybody cover up their
Mouths
And I haven't seen the body count lately
But looking at your faces it
Must have been bad
And if everybody answered their phone calls
But people
Say the army's on fire
It's like we sitting with our parachutes on
When the
Airport's gone
