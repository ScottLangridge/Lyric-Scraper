[Verse 1]
We got ourselves another one
We got ourselves another Jane Doe, Doe
I never let the others go
But every time I look around they form
See the shadow-men bow down to
The head of a baby calf, calf
If it isnt love then why do
I feel that Im split in half, half, half, half?

[Chorus]
Babe, dont look the other way
I love your face and theres no more time
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
Its ugly but it is all I want
Babe, they call me the medicine man
But my old spells dont work anymore

[Verse 2]
Dont ask for me tomorrow, kid
I think youll only find a grave man, man
Just take a look outside the walls
And try to tell me something thats good now
By my neck I feel some great weight
The Chupacabra clings on, on
Thats the rhythm my Pigdog loves
Its gotta mean something's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong

[Chorus]
Babe, dont look the other way
I love your face and theres no more time
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
Its ugly but it is all I want
Babe, they call me the medicine man
But my old spells dont work anymore

[Bridge]
Take aim

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
Its ugly but it is all I want
Babe, you don't want me sucking you down
What's all that young life been wasted on?
