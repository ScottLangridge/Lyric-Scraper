[Verse 1]
He held my hand when I died
He told me all I could ask
The politician bleats so blind
With his hard hat on rotating in a circle
Gimme some rosacea, nicotine to stain ya
Boys on the altar waiting to be crushed

[Pre Chorus]
(You wanna know) But as he takes the stage I'm gone
(You wanna know) Oh, what the hell is all this?

[Chorus]
Oh, is it in the way he calls your name?
Or is it in the way he prays for rain?
The wheel is turning now
It's really turning now

[Break]
Bone, to the blade
My letter, white feather, no halves
"Dread," that's what the devil said
My prison, my prison, my guard

[Verse 2]
He laid his hands upon me
He took ahold of my life
The terror and the old blood screech
When you mix those colours something's gonna happen
I don't wanna see them, I don't wanna know them
I spasm on the floor and wait for it to end

[Pre Chorus]
(You wanna know) But as he throws the crutches down
(You wanna know) Eleven thousand knees bent let them know you're coming

[Chorus]
Oh, is it in the way he calls your name?
Or is it in the way he makes you pray?
The wheel is turning now
It's really turning now

[Breakdown]
Do you wanna know how far you've come?
Do you have any idea?
Do you have any ideas?
