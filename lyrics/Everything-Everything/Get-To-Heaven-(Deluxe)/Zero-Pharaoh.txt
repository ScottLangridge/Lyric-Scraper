[Verse 1]
They tell me theres a Pharaoh in town
And now the town has gone to the dogs
They tell me hes a household name
Only no-one has a house anymore

[Verse 2]
They tell me theres a way to cheat death
And how you let him do what he wants
I bet you say he never does wrong
I don't know why you say it so much

[Chorus]
If all your children made it out alive
Then why would you ever go back?
Take your Pharaoh, put him in the black sack
Why dont you think for yourself?

[Verse 3]
Youre living in an overturned boat
Youre waiting for Valhalla to call
But every time you try to give blood
You somehow end up sucking it in

[Chorus]
If all your children made it out alive
Then why would you ever go back?
Take your Pharaoh, put him in the black sack
Why dont you smash him all up?

[Bridge]
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
Give me the gun, give me the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun
I'll give you the gun, I'll give you the gun

[Chorus]
With all these riches boiling at your cold spit
Why would you ever say no? Oh, would you ever say no?
All this fire drenched over all of your foes
Then why would you ever say no? Oh, would you ever say no?
And all those people laying down their whole lives
Why won't you ever say no? Oh, would you ever say no?
I'll break your Pharaoh and throw him in the Red Sea
Im gonna take it myself
