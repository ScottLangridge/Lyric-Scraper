[Verse]
No making it easy now
No making excuses now
No matter whose bomb's on your bus
They're making examples of us
Fuck your brother on the helipad
If he's dead he's not a deadbeat dad
I told you I'm a highwayman
But your money isn't worth a damn
I'm coming in cleaved in two
You're coming up steam right through
What happens to the gene pool now?
Keep talking but it won't come out
Still learning how to walk and speak
Still learning how to use your beak
Still working on Maggie's farm
Still wanking with a robot arm
I'm checking your name off my list
I'm checking your name off my list
I'm making up a reason to exist
I'm checking your name off my list
You're thinking that your wife is worth a lot
I'm telling you your life is worth a yacht
No matter whose knife in the dark
No matter whose (God or no masters)

[Chorus]
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no masters)
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no master)
Come to the river now, pick yourself a bodybag
Tell me all about your day
(No God and no masters)
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no masters)

[Verse]
No making it easy now
No making excuses now
No matter whose bomb's on your bus
They're making examples of us
Fuck your brother on the helipad
If he's dead he's not a deadbeat dad
I told you I'm a highwayman
But your money isn't worth a damn
I'm coming in cleaved in two
You're coming up steam right through
What happens to the gene pool now?
Keep talking but it won't come out
Still learning how to walk and speak
Still learning how to use your beak
Still working on Maggie's farm
Still wanking with a robot arm
I'm checking your name off my list
I'm checking your name on my list
I'm making up a reason to exist
I'm checking your name off my list
You're thinking that your wife is worth a lot
I'm telling you your life is worth a yacht
No matter whose knife in the dark
Still wanking with a robot arm
I'm checking your name off my list
I'm checking your name off my list
I'm making up a reason to exist
I'm checking your name off my list

[Chorus]
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no masters)
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no master)
Come to the river now, pick yourself a bodybag
Tell me all about your day
(No God and no masters)
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no masters)

[Bridge]
If all the bells in all the land are waiting for a toll
Why don't you raise your guillotine?
If all the bells in all the land are waiting for a toll
Why don't we raise our guillotine?

[Chorus]
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no masters)
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
(No God and no master)
Come to the river now, pick yourself a bodybag
Tell me all about your day
(No God and no masters)
Ah, kiss me baby with your Hapsburg lip
Make me nervous
