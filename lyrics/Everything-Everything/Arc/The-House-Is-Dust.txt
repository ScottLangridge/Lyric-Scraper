[Verse 1]
You take the family, I take the car
And the house is dust, mmm
Theres a cap on the bottle that wont let you in
A childproof lock, mmm
And its one for the money and two for the show
Your idle hands, mmm
And now whos the fossil and who gets the girl?
Its all so clear, mmm

[Refrain]
And oh, what say you to something more?
What say you to something more?

[Verse 2]
The sleep debt on my back
Makes my eyes roll back
Im living proof that nothing gets done
Im living proof that nothing gets done

[Outro]
I wish I could be living
At the end of all living
Just to know what happens
Just to know what happens
I would know every answer
And just how far we all made it
This is all my life
This is all my life
