There were reasons to get outta my bed

Slipping in and out of what you call life
And the place again and not seeing in
And [incomprehensible]
And I died that day
Makes no difference if were open or closed
When you shake my hand
Im a hero, Im a hero
And Im [incomprehensible], yeah Im [incomprehensible]
 
I think Ive had enough with all the lights on earth
I think Im done with answering the phone
I bought myself a bridge and I cant go back
I think its gonna happen pretty soon
Dare, for the longest time
 
And Im sorry that Ive made it this far
When you think you [incomprehensible] dont remember [incomprehensible]
And Im [incomprehensible]
And the faces of my family fade
Now as featureless as an orange, as an orange
[Incomprehensible] let me go
 
I think Ive had enough with all the lights on earth
I think Im done with answering the phone
I bought myself a bridge and I cant go back
I think its gonna happen pretty soon
 
You ask how many fingers am I holding up
I dont know what is taking me so long
Lets get up off the floor and use our feet for hands
I see double, I see double yellow lines
 
[Guitar solo]
 
And I can see the [incomprehensible]
By the waterfall
Dont remember, dont remember
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] world outside
Yeah she really had me going for a while
I wont forget you
I wont forget you
I wont forget you
