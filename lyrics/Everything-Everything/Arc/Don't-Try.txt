Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh

Is it gonna take a battle of wits
Well I can take a body, I can take a body blow
Pick you head up
Show your teeth to them honey
We can take it slowly, we can take it really slow

Cos everybody says you never speak up
And never take a moment, never take a moments rest
I see you skulking on the basketball court
And I wanna be the perfect, the p-p-p-p-perfect test

Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh

I know youre waiting for a miracle call but
I can disappoint you, I can disappoint you now
You shut the door and get your hibernate on
Its never gonna leave you if you never talk it out

I know you think youre in a bottomless pit, hell
Ill be at the bottom, waiting with my shivers and shakes
The girls are reaching up to meet you, just let
[Incomprehensible]

Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh

Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Dont try to hide it, no
Dont try
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh
Cos itll have you in the end, ohhhh

Dont try to hide it

Ahhhhhh
