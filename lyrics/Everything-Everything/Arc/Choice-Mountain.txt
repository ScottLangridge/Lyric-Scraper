I'm tryna read my ocean home 
I'm tryna read my ocean
Though I don't know nothing of the swamp
And I could be a limbless star
Pushing out the circle
Ready to delight [incomprehensible]
And you don't look impressed
I could be the dolphin of your dreams
Willing wings to my chest 
One day I'll go up and show you how 
Winds and monsoons will give you a [incomprehensible]
But so much yet to hide, am I lose no more friends no
Film on my lips 
And why you never call like I'm old, and I'm cold 
I'm not coming good
A cherub in the ash tray

Wriggling back to the source, 
And thrashing up the water falls for what
Somewhere there is a place 
And I could be the whale that takes you all
But maybe I'm a lioness, 
And when I reach the shore
I'll tear apart hyenas with no thought 
Now organs and a glossy globe 
And codder at the tension 
Muscle mass and [incomprehensible]
 Tryin to figure my place
And feverish with all my dreams away 
They don't notice me now 
But I could be the whale that takes them all

I know...

Try this and try this and try this again 
I'm never gonna make it
Don't leave me, [incomprehensible] me 
Let's try this again 
The tiny little fish
[Incomprehensible] homeless, and [incomprehensible]
And drifting away 
Just [incomprehensible]

And ancient up to the pond 
Only to be lost among the wild 
Somewhere there is a place 
And I could be a pterodactyl god
I'm tryna to read my ocean home.
