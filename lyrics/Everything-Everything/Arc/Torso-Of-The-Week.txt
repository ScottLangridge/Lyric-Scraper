Girl youve been hitting that treadmill, like a freak
Maybe youre not quite the torso, of the week
The hollowest cheeks in the county
Time to tweet
Jogging all over my grave baby
With your big bare feet
Coiled heart, eyetoothed, feral child
Take me dancing, in the wild
Youre looking like youre bored with a husband
Youre looking like you might have a question
So why you staring out of the window
I can't stop the pain unless you tell me
 
[Chorus]
What you wrestling with, what you wresting, wrestling
What you wrestling with, what you wresting, wrestling with
Girl youve been hitting that treadmill, like a freak
What you wrestling with, what you wresting, wrestling
What you wrestling with, what you wresting, wrestling with
Baby youre not quite the torso, of the week

Girl youve been offered the big deal
Dont look back
Possible perks of the lifestyle, gold and black
The minerals all through your system
Thats my girl
And juggling all of your babies
With your black [incomprehensible]
Coiled heart, eyetoothed, feral child
Take me dancing, in the wild
Youre looking like youre bored with a husband
Youre looking like you might have a question
So why you staring out of the window
I can't stop the pain unless you tell me
 
[Chorus]
What you wrestling there, what you wresting, wrestling
What you wrestling there, what you wresting, wrestling there
Girl youve been hitting the treadmill, like a freak
What you wrestling there, what you wresting, wrestling
What you wrestling there, what you wresting, wrestling there
Baby youre not quite the torso, of the week
 
Coiled heart, eyetoothed, feral child

Youre looking like you might have a question
Youre looking like youre lost on your thinking
Youre screaming like you saw all your features
Your wrist is not unnoticed in the trembling
[Chorus]
What you wrestling with, what you wresting, wrestling
What you wrestling with, what you wresting, wrestling with
Girl youve been hitting the treadmill, like a freak
What you wrestling, wrestling
What you, what you
What you wrestling with
Baby youre not quite the torso, of the week
Take my life
[Incomprehensible]
What you wresting, wrestling
What you wrestling there, what you wresting, wrestling there
Baby youre not quite the torso, of the week
