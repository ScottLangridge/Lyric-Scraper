The street is a boneyard, she glances
Numbers are drained at the end, end
Cradling heat waves and armour
[Incomprehensible] slowly
How [incomprehensible] to know this
How do we live in the end, end

I bet you the price of the landline
You wont be here at the end, end
You wont be slumped in a doorway
Youll be standing above it
How can you call this a free world
I wouldnt call out at the end, end

No more doubt about it

[Chorus:]
I wanna take you home
Take off your blindfold
And show you what I am
I wanna take you home
And find some new joy
In this autopilot life
I wanna take you home
Slow down your heartbeat
And dry those glazing eyes
I wanna take you home
Black out our windows
And hold you till we die

What if the first step was leaving
And stepping outside in the cold, end
Facing the smoke and youre lurching
Down the alleys, kiss me
And how many lives lived in fear now
And who do we call in the end, end

There was a pattern of errors
There was a life here to mend, mend
I wasnt watching the cold past
Put on my body slowly
And there goes a [incomprehensible]
Rattling round in the end, end

No more doubt about it

[Chorus:]
I wanna take you home
Take off your blindfold
And show you what I am
I wanna take you home
And find some new joy and
In this autopilot life
I wanna take you home
Slow down your heartbeat
And dry those glazing eyes
I wanna take you home
Black out our windows
And hold you till we die

[Chorus:]
I wanna take you home
Take off your blindfold
And show you what I am
I wanna take you home
And find some new joy
In this autopilot
I wanna take you home
Slow down your heartbeat
And dry those glazing eyes
I wanna take you home
Black out our windows
And hold you till we die

Ohhhh, Im sorry
