So they came, one by one, there was never any warning
Bled out the stuck pig fields like it was gonna last long
And I saw the whole rise, I saw the whole thing fall down
And all flesh spun, a lattice of it reaching out

Oh I'm left holding my head looking down at every grave
And all millennia pass, just a flicker in a wave
And I've seen more villages burn than animals born
I've seen more towers come down than children grow up

Cross the peaks, cross the marsh, cross your fingers for the last time
And pass out the blame to someone and never step it up side
And nobody's asking, "Why is your head bent down so?"
There's trillions lost, I'm dreaming of a different time

I'm left holding my head looking down at every grave
And all millennia pass, just a flicker in a wave
And I've seen more villages burn than animals born
I've seen more towers come down than children grow up

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I've seen biomass swarm back and forth across the globe
They try all manner of things just to keep it all afloat
And I've seen more criminals hung than innocents walk
I've seen more horrors made real than dreamers wake up

Oh
Oh
Oh
Come now, Decider, sit down beside me
Tell me my world is gone, oh
