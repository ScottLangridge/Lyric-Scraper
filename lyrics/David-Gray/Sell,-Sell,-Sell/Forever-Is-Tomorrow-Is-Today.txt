Tuesday my heart is brimming
I'm a child in the wild wind
Dead leaves and daylight dimming
No beginning and no end
Inside a candle of defiance
Moonlight
A river of pearls

Cause we're going to need more
Than money and science
To see us through this world

You say it can't be done
You'd rather die of fun
Get out of the way
For me for you for everyone
Forever is tomorrow is today

Shut all the windows
Shut all the doors
We're keeping it all out of sight
We're keeping it all
It's tearing us apart
You don't know your good
From your bad from your black
From your blood from your wrong
From your right
So you camouflage your heart

I don't want no other distractions
There's too much here to see
Faint hearts or jaded reactions
Contraptions of history

You say it can't be done
You'd rather die of fun
Get out of the way
For me for you for everyone
Forever is tomorrow is today

Shut all the windows
Shut all the doors
I'm keeping it all out of sight
I'm keeping it all
It's mine and mine alone
Corrosion collision
I need a vision
To tear off the cloak of the night
And shatter eyes of stone

You say it can't be done
You'd rather die of fun
Get out of the way
For me for you for everyone
Forever is tomorrow is today
Forever is tomorrow is today
Forever is tomorrow is today
