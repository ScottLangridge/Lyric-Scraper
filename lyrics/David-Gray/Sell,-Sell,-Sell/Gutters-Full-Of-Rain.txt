A gutter full of rain
An empty picture frame
A house out at the edges of the city
Never noticing the war
Til it's right there at your door
And suddenly your hands are bloody

I was seeking to possess
Now another girl's caress
Is on your flesh
The bitterness is tasted
There's nobody in your chair
No hand to touch my hair
The sun even the air seems wasted

Let it go now
Let it all slip away
And we'll start it all over again
Me like a million others before
Trying to make sense of the rain

Were these twenty years a dream
Was it ever as it seemed
Get to wonder if it really existed
Cause the thief who stole my life
Has taken too my faith
I can see now how the world gets
Twisted

Let it go now
Let it all slip away
And we'll start it all over again
Me like a million others before
Trying to make sense of the rain

In spite of all the shame
Sometimes I hear your name
I think of us when we were younger
Then I'm shutting out the noise
And I'm trying to hear the voice
That used to tell me love was
Stronger

Light another cigarette
But the one I got's still lit
I can't seem to keep my fingers
Steady
Never noticing the war
Til it's right there at your door
And suddenly your hands are bloody
