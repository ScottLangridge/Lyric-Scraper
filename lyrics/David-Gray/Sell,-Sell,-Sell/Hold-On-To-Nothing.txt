Hold on to nothing
Hold on to coldest steel
It chills you down inside
When you see just what is real
Paste it up and tear it down
Move it on along the rushing road
Seventeen fahrenheit
Feel the winter grow

There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it down
There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it down
Nowhere to write it down
Write it down

Step down the alley
Walking against the stony crowd
Trying not to listen
But they shout so loud
Chew you up and spit you out
Crush you between it's finger and it's thumb
The world in all it's anger
Oh and there's always more to come

There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it down
There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it
There's nowhere to write it down
Nowhere to write it down
Write it down
