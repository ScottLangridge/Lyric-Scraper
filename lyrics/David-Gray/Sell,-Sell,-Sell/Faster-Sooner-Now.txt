Hey now, you got me by the tongue
I feel like there's nowhere I belong
And they're working it pretty hard
And they're selling it by the yard
But it's more than I can afford
That's all that I know

Leader, it comes as no surprise
See now, these are coins that were his eyes
Silver dollars and hoods of steel
Tell me nothing can be revealed
The more you get it the less you feel
That's all that I know
Starts a shivering in my spine
And a fever I can't define
It gets colder the higher you climb
That's all that I know

You kill me with every word you say
I'm dead now, along with faith and chivalry
Silver dollars and hoods of steel
Tell me nothing can be revealed
The more you get it the less you feel
That's all that I know
Colder the higher you climb
Colder the higher you climb
Colder the higher you climb
That's all that I know
