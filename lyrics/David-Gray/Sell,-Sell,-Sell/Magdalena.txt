Morning, sit in the morning sun
Evening, watching the shadow come
Through the bright streets of london
I feel the rain
Upon my eyes as I wonder
At this spell that I'm under, magdalen
Since you came along

Meet me with your arms of snow and
Meet me with your mouth undone
I'm burning up from head to tow eh
Magdalena when you're gone

Dreaming, we're drinking the night away
Talking, way past the break of day
Through the bright streets of london
I feel the rain
Upon my eyes as I wonder
At this spell that I'm under, magdalen
Since you came along

Meet me with your arms of snow and
Meet me with your mouth undone
I'm burning up from head to tow eh
Magdalena when you're gone

Nananananananananananananana
Nananananananananananananana

Meet me with your arms of snow and
Meet me with your mouth undone
I'm burning up from head to tow eh
Magdalena when you're gone
