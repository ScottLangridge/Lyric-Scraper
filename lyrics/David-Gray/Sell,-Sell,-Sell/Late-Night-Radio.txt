Oh mary jane
She step on a train
Head for the city lights
Yearning inside
To swim with the tide
And taste it, alright
Bag on her shoulder
Breathing the cold
There by the metal tracks
She saw it all shine
And swore in her mind
She'd never go back

And she don't mind the late night
Late night radio
She don't mind the late night radio
She don't mind the late night
Late night radio
Na na

Couldn't have dreamed
The things that she seen
There on the avenue
She stared right into a million eyes
That looked her right through
Telling red joe
The places she'd go
And wiping the table clean
She got no idea
The demon of fear
Or what a broken heart mean

And she don't mind the late night
Late night radio
She don't mind the late night radio
She don't mind the late night
Late night radio
Na na na na na not at all
Na na na na na not at all
Na na na na na not at all
Na na

New york was dark
Dirty and stark
Burning with yellow wings
Everyday come
With fever and hum
Who knows what it brings
Walking a wall
Without a thought
To fall and hit the ground
Sweet mary jane
With eyes like the rain
Alive to the sound

And she don't mind the late night
Late night radio
She don't mind the late night radio
She don't mind the late night
Late night radio
And she don't mind the late night
Late night radio
She don't mind the late night radio
She don't mind the late night
Late night radio
Na na na na
