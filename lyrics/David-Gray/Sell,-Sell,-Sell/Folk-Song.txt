I have waited the night over
For some word to come
I asked the moon o'er the clover
But the moon she is dumb

You have made me a promise
At midnight we'd go
And that we should be married
Sailing westward ho

Such words you have spoken
You have told me a lie
That it could not be broken
When you knew it must die

There's no light in heaven
My eye can see
That my heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
Go free

Like honey the ocean
In the morning breeze
I'll take my tears to the water
That the rivers may freeze

There's no light in heaven
Can shine for me
That my heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
Go free

What folly is beauty
What trick of the skin
Desire it's fancy
And ruin it's whim
Your child within me
And what can I do
My blood fill with needles
That he look like you

There's no light in heaven
My eye can see
That my heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
My heart be imprisoned
While the devil go free
No light in heaven
No light for me
