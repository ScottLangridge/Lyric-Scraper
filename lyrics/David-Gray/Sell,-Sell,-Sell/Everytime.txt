Down from the doorway
And into the street
I hear the morning bell
Over and over the pattern repeat
I hear the morning bell
And all the faces cold as stone
In the january chill
You have led me into worlds unknown
And I'm walking there still

Everytime now
Everytime now
I think of you mine now
I just can't contain
I'm seven feet tall and
There's nightingales calling
Shooting stars falling
Like jewels in the rain

I ask myself I ask myself
Can this life be the same
That spun me round and put me down
And fill me up with shame
And all the heads are turning now
Down the tottenham court road
Cause I just can't help but sing it out
Case I just might explode

Everytime now
Everytime now
I think of you mine now
I can't comprehend
The saxophones blowing
Cherry trees growing
Right here in my hand

A dance in the moonlight
So high on a june night
Magazines strewn right
Over the chair
Your spine a white ladder
Your eyes singing sadder
Nothing else seems to matter
As soon as you're there
And everytime now
Everytime now
I think of you mine now
I just can't contain
I'm seven feet tall and
There's nightingales calling
Shooting stars falling
Like jewels in the rain
Everytime now
Everytime now
Everytime now
Everytime
And la la la na etc.
