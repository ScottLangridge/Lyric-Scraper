White ladder
Water and wine
Forever crying
Oh time
Don't wanna feel tonight
There's no rhyme or reason to life
This sweet life

White river
Thunder and war
Forever crying
Oh no
Don't wanna feel tonight
Ther's no rhyme or reason to life
This sweet life

To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another valentine
A burning flame
To the night another body
To the night another name
To the night another valentine
A burning flame

White ladder
Water and wine
Don't wanna feel tonight
