This years love it better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own too long
And when you hold me like you do it feels so right oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on

Turning circles time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If you love me I got to know for sure
Cause it takes something more this time than sweet sweet lies oh now,
Before I open up my arms and fall, losing all control,
Every dream inside my soul, when you kiss me on that midnight street,
Sweep me off my feet, singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love it better last

This years love it better last
Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When the hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on
Won't you kiss me on that midnight street,
Sweep me off my feet, singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love it better last
This years love it better last
This years love it better last
This years love it better last
This years love it better last
Whoah ah
This years love it better last
