Standing at the door of the Pink Flamingo, Crying in the rain
Here was a kind of so-so love and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen again
You and I it, had to be the standing joke of the year
You were a run-around, a lost and found, then I found thee half healed

CHORUS

Take your hands off me
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face for the last time
I never knew you,you never knew me, say hello, goodbye
Say hello and wave goodbye

We tried to make it work, you in a cocktail skirt and me in a suit but it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less and now your life's a mess so insecure you see
Well I put up with all the scenes and this is one scene that's going to be played my way

CHORUS

Under the deep red light, I can see the make-up sliding down
Well hey little girl, you will always make-up so take off that unbecoming frown
As for me well, I'll find someone who's not going cheap in the sales
A nice little house wife who'll give me the steady life and not keep going off the rails.

CHORUS
Repeat Say hello- wave goodbye

We were born before the wind, who are we to understand
We were born before the wind, say goodbye
Through the rain, sleet and snow, get on the train and say goodbye, say goodbye, in the wind and the rain my darling, say goodbye
In the wind and the rain my darling.
