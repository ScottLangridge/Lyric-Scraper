What on earth is going on in my heart
Has it turned as cold as stone
Seems these days I don't feel anything
Unless it cuts me right down to the bone
What on earth is going on in my heart

Cause my oh my you know it just don't stop
Its in my mind I want to tear it up
Been trying to fight it trying to turn it off
But it's not enough
It takes a lot of love it takes a lot of love my friend
To keep your heart from freezing to push on to the end

What on earth is going on in my head
You know I used to be so sure
You know I used to be so definite
Thought I knew what love was for
I look aroudn these days I'm not so sure
No na na

My oh my you know it just don't stop
Its in my mind I want to tear it up
Been trying to fight it trying to turn it off
But it's not enough
It takes a lot of love it takes a lot of love my friend
To keep your heart from freezing to push on to the end

My oh my you know I just can't win
I burn it down it comes right back again
What kind of world is this we're livin in
Where you never win
It takes a lot of love it takes a lot of love these days
To keep your heart from freezing to keep your spirit free

My oh my

My oh my you know it just don't stop
Its in my mind I want to tear it up
Been trying to fight it trying to turn it off
But it's not enough
It takes a lot of love it takes a lot of love my friend
To keep your heart from freezing to push on till the end

My oh my you know it just don't stop...
