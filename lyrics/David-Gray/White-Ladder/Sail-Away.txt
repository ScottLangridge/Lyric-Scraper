Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me, what will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now

Crazy skies are wild above me now
Winter howling at my face
And everything I held so dear
Disappeared without a trace

Through all the times I tasted love
Never knew quite what I had
Little darling if you hear me now
Never needed you so bad

Spinning round my head

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me, what will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now

I been talking drunken gibberish
Falling in and out of bars
Trying to get some explanation here
For the way some people are
How did it come so far

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me, what will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me, what will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me, what will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now, now

It break me up if you pull me down, oh..
Sail away with me, what will be will be
I wanna hold you now, now now
