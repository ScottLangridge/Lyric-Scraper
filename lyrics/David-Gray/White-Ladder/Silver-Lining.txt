Take the silver lining
Keep it in your own sweet hand
Then shine it when the light is burning red
Shine it in the twilight
Shine it on the cold cold ground
Shine it till these walls come tumbling down

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know there the light don't sleep

Step into the silence
Take it in your own sweet hands
And sprinkle it like diamonds
All accross these lands
Blazing in the morning
Wearing like an iron skin
Only thing's worth living for are innocence and magic baby

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know there the light don't sleep

We were born with our eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why
Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know there the light don't sleep
Know there the light don't sleep
Don't sleep

Time after time they drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know there the light don't sleep
Know there the light don't sleep
