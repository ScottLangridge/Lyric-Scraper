Feel the weight of the passing time
Of the crazy faces run through my mind
And this song has brought a teardrop to my eye
Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right

See this world that I can't relate in
Everything must accelerate
Betty Forde oh won't you be my valentine
We can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right
We can't tell the bottle from the mountain top now my hands are shaking but I just can't stop
Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right

Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top now my knees are shaking but I just can't stop
Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right

Now I'm weak and my head is sore and I feel like I can't go on no more
Come in here where normal rules do not apply
Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right
Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right
Can't tell the bottle from the mountain top no we're not right
Yeah yeah
