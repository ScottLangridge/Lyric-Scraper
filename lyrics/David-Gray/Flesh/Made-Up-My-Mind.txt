Lightening strikes, silver motorbikes
Roaring down the open road, wind on my skin
I'm hungry to begin, my cup has overflown
So let fall the rain down into these desert veins
Taking back what they stole
These diamonds in the mine
Can afford to become fine
In someone else's pigeon hole

So I made up my mind
Made up my mind
Gonna move on ahead
Instead of lagging behind

Half past seven way up in the heaven
The stars are singing in the sky
Lying half dressed, your head upon my breast
Listening to the ocean's lullaby
Standing where we are, it seems so far
From the cold light of day
With the faces full of grief,
And the grinding up of teeth
Has been eating my belief away

So I made up my mind
I made up my mind
Gonna move on ahead
Instead of lagging behind
Instead of lagging now..

Cracks in the veneer and the light so severe
Shining down the avenue try to join the throng
But it's feeling all wrong what are you supposed to do
Shoulder that despair take a lung of dirty air
Turn to watch the sun set red
And the ruins of a culture
Of a sky that's filled with vultures
Circling over your head

So I made up my mind
I made up my mind
Gonna move on ahead
Instead of lagging behind
Instead of lagging behind

I made up my mind....
