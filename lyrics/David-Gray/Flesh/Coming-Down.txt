Tears falling slow
From the bridge
Into the river below
In your eyes, I start to see
A starry veil,
The ocean of infinity

Moon and stars above me
Mingle with the blood
Inside my vein
These empty arms
That should be
Holding you close
Through nights of winter rain
I'm trying to spell
What only the wind can explain
It's colder than ever
Coming down

I'm drowning in shallows
Cos it's in so deep
There's neon melting in the rain
Took too much powder too sleep
Cos when I hold you naked
When I see you laugh
I got a sword to stem the rivers
And cut the moon in half

Frozen stars above me
Mingle with the blood
Inside my vein
Empty arms that should be
Holding you close
Through nights of winter rain
I'm trying to spell
What only the wind can explain
It's colder than ever
Coming down

We danced wild
Kicked off our shoes
Not a cloud
In the skies to confuse
Now the sky is cold
The sea is wide
And there's nothing to be done
'cept reflecting the sun
And scratching the mountainside

Frozen stars above me
Mingle with the blood
Inside my vein
Empty arms that should be
Holding you close
Through nights of winter rain
I'm trying to spell
What only the wind can explain
It's colder than ever
Coming down
