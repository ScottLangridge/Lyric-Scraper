Its a sad old world
That's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning
And in my hand your broken dream

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

All these useless emotions
Churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time
The truth is flashing in my mind
That when a heart gets broken
There's nothing you can do

My watery eyes
I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

And I'm packing my belongings
Hey I'll be gone before the noon arrives
Cos I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright

But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead

Hear the bells
