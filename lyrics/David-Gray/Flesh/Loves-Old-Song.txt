It's like this
It's all in here
Just one kiss
Will make that clear
So let the flower open
Let the ship sail
Don't need no meaningless token
To hear the nightingale

For everything that's been
For all that's yet to come
Brow full of moonbeams
Singing loves old song

Beauty threads it's needle
In every eye a light will shine
From the graveyard to the cradle
All the bells of wonder chime
No further complication
Here for the queen or for the pawn
Night of such revelation
The jew is trembling on the thorn

For everything that's been
For all that's yet to come
Brow full of moonbeams
Singing loves old song

Loves old song
Playing in our hearts
Binding it together
Pulling it apart

Loves old song
Playing pure and bold
Time has come to read
What's written in your soul

Yeah yeah yeah

Out in the fields of bloody slumber
Shadows fleeing from the sun
Without aim and without number
These children of oblivion

For everything that's been
For everything's that come
A brow full of moonbeams
Singing loves old song

Loves old song
Playing in our hearts
Binding it together
Pulling it apart

Loves old song
Playing pure and bold
Time has come to read
What's written there in your soul

Yah yah yeah
Whoa oh oh

For everything that's been
For everything's that come
Brow full of moonbeams
Singing loves old song
