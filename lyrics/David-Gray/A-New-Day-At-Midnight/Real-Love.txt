The dawn in all it's majesty
Is stealing me away
The dawn in all it's honesty
Is turning me to clay
And through the bears of iron rain
Way beyond and back again
I hear the voice of eden cry
Lift me up I'm walking on high

It's real love
Real love

This world in all it's clarity
Is glorious, is fake
This world in all it's vanity
Is more than I can take
And down the road the iron wheels
Chain my heart to how it feels
I hear the voice of eden cry
Lift me up I'm walking on high

It's real love
Real love
Real love
Real love

And something in the heart of me
Is telling me it's time
To meet the eye of destiny
And leave it all behind
And through my bones an iron rage
Paints my soul upon the page

I hear the voice of eden cry
Lift me up to walk on high
Make me wanna lay down and die
It's real love
Real love
Real love
Real love
The dawn in all it's majesty
Is stealing me away
