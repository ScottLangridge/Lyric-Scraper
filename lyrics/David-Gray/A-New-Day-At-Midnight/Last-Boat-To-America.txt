Make me a boat
Away I'll float
Into the stillness of a pure blue sky
There's nothing here to hold me now
And I got no more tears to cry

Grant me a wish just one more kiss
Oh baby kiss me till the daylight's through
These days of make believe
But there ain't nothing any fool can do

Pin another dream on my
Cause the night is bearing down
Baby let's got all the way this time

Sing me the truth sweet bird of youth
I got some trouble trying to understand
Beneath the veils of mystery
Are these the movements of an unseen hand

Our arms are full of sunken treasure baby
Now our heads are full of perfect sound
But do we truly see it hey
Till we're placing it in the ground

Take just what you need from me
Cause the night is bearing down
Baby let't go all the way this time

Frost on my windowpane is forming

Don't pin that line on me oh no
Don't pin that line on me oh no
Don't pin that line on me oh no
Don't pin that line on me oh no

Baby let's go all the way this time
Won't you take me all the way this time
Baby let's go all the way this time
Make me a boat
Away I'll float
Into the stillness of a pure blue sky
