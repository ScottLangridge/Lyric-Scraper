People stand in line
People stand in line
People stand in line
A permonition of
The killer's angel eyes
An armageddon sky
Tell it like it is
It's like the old man says
We're dead in the water now
Dead in the water

They come from miles around
They come from miles around
They come from miles around
In avarice and love
To suckle on the blood
Of some forgotten god
Sell it like it is
It's like the old man says
We're dead in the water now
We're dead in the water now
Dead in the water

A simple act of faith
A simple act of faith
A simple act of faith
A celebration of
The colour and the creed
The cancer and it's seed
Crackles on the mic
Can call it what you like
We're dead in the water now
We're dead in the water now
Dead in the water
