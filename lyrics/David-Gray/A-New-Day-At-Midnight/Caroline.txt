Caroline
Those crazy eyes that shine
Them days blowing through my mind
Like falling leaves

It ain't no good
I try hard as I would
Yeah but you just wont let
My poor heart be

A final war
A steel-eyed dinosaur
Girl I want you more, than I can say

But Caroline
It seems like every time
Honey all I get
Is further away

The state I'm in
Got goose bumps on my skin
See the water jump right in
You're hearts so free

I'll face the facts
It's paper on the cracks
Girl 'till I got you right
Back here with me

A final war
A steel-eyed dinosaur
Girl I need you more, than I can say

But Caroline
It seems like every time
Baby all I get
Is further away

Baby all I get
Is further away

A final war
A steel-eyed dinosaur
Girl I want you more, than I can say

But Caroline
It seems like every time
Honey all I get
Is further away

Honey all I get
Is further away

Baby all I get Is further
Further
Further
Further away
