Slow voices speaking through a hurricane
Said that I wanted but I lied
You're looking good
Hey man I can't complain
Ghost on the road at night

Seen him out walking he's just skin and bones
I don't see nothing in her eyes
Some call it hell felt like home from home
I'm dreaming different skies

I don't know where I
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now
Get it on all night
I don't know where I
I don't know what I
It seems to me boy
That you're doing all right
I don't know what I
I don't know where I
Long way to go now
Keep it all inside

36 hours but my mind is fresh
Live for the moment the I'm gone
Suck on the sympathy and feel the rush
Go on my blue eyed son

I don't know where I
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now
Get it on all night
I don't know where I
I don't know what I
It seems to me boy
That you're doing all right
I don't know what I
I don't know where I
Long way to go now
Keep it all inside

(repeat chorus)
