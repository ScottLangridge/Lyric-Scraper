If I lean my weight on it
If I fix my heart to the line
Might find a way from it
To some easy time
My skin's all while with it
I'm up so high when I fall
I fall so from it
Ain't nowhere at all

Early morning sun
Shine it and I'm gone
To plane out and on the lake
Hey hey yeah yeah
To glide out on the wing
Turn around and sing
The fear now taking hold
I'll bring you love but it's all been sold

My head's all wired with it
My tongue gets tied when I speak
The space inside roaring
When that signal break

Early morning sun
Shine it and I'm gone
To plane out and on the lake
Hey hey yeah yeah
To glide out on the wing
Turn around and sing
The fear now taking hold
I'll bring you love but it's all been sold
