I care little for my body she said
I couldn't care less about my soul
And as she led me upstairs in whispers
My whole summer turned cold

I'll lead you upstairs
I'll lead you upstairs
If you've got no worries
Then I've got no cares
I'll lead you upstairs

I told her people had been talking
About how dark she was inside
She said my hopes are buried in the soil
Deep in the earth outside
And with one twist of the world
She brought me to her side
She asked me for the truth one time
And I all I did was lie

I'll lead you upstairs
I'll lead you upstairs
If you've got no worries
Then I've got no cares
I'll lead you upstairs
