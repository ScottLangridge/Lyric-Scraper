I got no reason
But that I must
Maybe I feel
Like I've been gathering dust
I must leave this harbour for the sea
I'm too young to settle down and make a home
But I don't know where I'm wanting to be
I just know I have to be there alone

Stole my time, all my time
Stole my time for you

Pale winter sun
Is beatin' the ground
Why'm I throwin' away
The best thing that I've found
My young heart's in tatters and I'm sure
That it will be a long time healing
It's so hard to see what I'm doing this for
When loneliness is all that I'm feeling

Stole my time, all my time
Spend my time for you

Now the wind it is blowing
Blowing leaves from the trees
I've got no use knowing
That with time it will ease
I don't know where I'm going
Hope I get there soon
Cos my soul is hollow
As the sorrowful moon
Na na na na...

Now the wind it is blowing
Blowing leaves from the trees
I've got no use knowing
That with time it will ease
I don't know where I'm going
Hope I get there soon
Cos my soul is hollow
As the sorrowful moon
Na na na na...

The night is raining on my weary head
Taking me back

See the sun spread it's wings of gold
As the dawn unfurls
Hear the song that the moon sings
To the darkened world
Feel the fire lighting
In the bitter cold
See the light that shines
Through the windows of your soul
