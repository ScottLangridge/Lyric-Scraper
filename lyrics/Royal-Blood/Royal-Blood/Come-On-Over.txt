A train going nowhere
No way in world to make you kill
And slit my heart, and slit my home
And when I'm feeling away from you

So come on over, the winner will be a believer
So come on over, please don't call it like you really care

Still feeling weary, get off how I feel
I can get money like I don't care
This ain't my house, this ain't my home
And what I'm feelin' is worse

So come on over, the winner will be a believer
So come on over, please don't call it like you really care
