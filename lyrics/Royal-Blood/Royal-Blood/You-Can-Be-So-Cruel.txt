[Verse 1]
I'm outside your window
I'm outside your door
You've never been this lonely
Well, I've never been this down before and it shows

Killing me so gently
Hands wrapped round my throat
Choking me so slowly
Slicing every word down to the bone

[Chorus]
'Cause you can be so cruel
And that's all I've ever known
Cruel world

[Verse 2]
Look outside your window
Look outside your door
Wake you when you're sleeping
'Cause I've never been this down before and it shows

No, I've never been this down before

[Chorus]
'Cause you can be so cruel
And that's all I've ever known
Cruel world

Yeah, you can be so cruel
And that's all you've ever done
Cruel world
Cruel world
Cruel world
Cruel world
Cruel
