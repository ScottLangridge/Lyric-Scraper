[Verse 1]
How did it feel when it came alive and took you
Out of the black? It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

[Chorus]
You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk cos you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heartbeat and blood for an empty pocket

[Verse 2]
I never knew why and you didn't care when
It closed every door, I watched them wait [?]
And I promised you like you promised me
But those vows we made fucked it up for free

[Chorus x2]

And it's hard to slow
Never lets you go
[?]
