Loose change
Another penny in my pocket again
No Shame
Another heart-shaped locket
Choke chain
With 24 carats just to hock it again
Theres nobody home, no theres nobody home

Cause all that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
Yeah, your money dont fold

Stuck stood still with your door banging
Shadow through your little hole
But theres nobody home, Yeah theres nobody home

Teeth clean, nineteen, hearts queen lookin' on the guillotine
Theyll get down on your floor, theyll get down on your floor

Cause all that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
All that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
All that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
All that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold

I wanna double my money
So dont act, dont act like theres nobody home
Yeah quit playin' God on your telephone
Hand it over all to me
About as funny as a broken bone
But theres nobody home, yeah theres nobody home

Cause all that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
All that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
All that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
All that glitters is gold
Till the glitter gets sold and the money dont fold
