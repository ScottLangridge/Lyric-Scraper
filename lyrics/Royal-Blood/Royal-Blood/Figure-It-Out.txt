Nothing here to see
Just a kid like me
Trying to cut some teeth
Trying to figure it out

Nothing better to do
When I'm stuck on you
And still I'm here
Trying to figure it out

Getting hard to sleep
But it is in my dreams
But it's killing me
To try and figure it out

Nothing better to do
When I'm stuck on you
And still I'm here
Trying to figure it out

I'll let it go 'cause I won't see you later
And I'm not allowed to talk it out
I said I'll come, I'll promise I won't show
But I see you trying to figure it out
I promise you, I'll take a bet on you
But you didn't know I planned it out
I said I'll go, yeah, I won't see you later
And I'm not allowed to figure it out

Nothing here to see
