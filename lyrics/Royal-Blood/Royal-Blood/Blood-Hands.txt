[Verse 1]
Took a lonely feeling
Just to let the meaning
Sink like the sun goes down
Never close to heaven
Felt my feet were burning from the same red hot ground

[Break 1]
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

[Verse 2]
It's getting hard to listen
When the clock is ticking
Counting down the days gone by
Praying for an answer to another question
That will only leave you dry

[Break 2]
You won't understand
With your head in the sand
No, you won't

[Chorus]
But I'll kiss the ground where you kneel
'Til I grow my hair to my heels
Spike your water your wine
While you waste my precious time

[Verse 3]
Every time I drink and try to stop my thinking
Bout the things I've said and done
Stop the world from turning faster
Then I'm learning not to just hide and run

[Break 2]
You won't understand
With your head in the sand
No, you won't

[Verse 4]
Love came and went
Faster than a penny spent
In a slot machine
Nowhere near the devil, just somewhere in between you and me
Sworn to see me

[Chorus]
And I'll kiss the ground where you kneel
'Til I grow my hair to my heels
Spike your water your wine

[Break 1]
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

[Verse 1]
Took a lonely feeling
Just to let the meaning
Sink like the sun goes down
Never close to heaven
Felt my feet were burning from the same red hot ground
