[Verse 1]
Say my prayers every night
But no one's there to make it right
Holding on
Nothing's changed
Same old love just rearranged

[Pre-Chorus]
No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
No
No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
So

[Chorus]
Just look like you know
Look like you know something I should
I think I should go
I really feel like you want me to
Don't say that you want me
Don't pray the wish you can't make come true
Can I be replaced?
Cause that look on your face
Says "Baby I never knew"

[Verse 2]
Happiness on a drip
To total bliss running down the drain
Losing count of the days
Now every kiss just feels the same

[Pre-Chorus]
No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
No
No it's not better
No it's not better
No it's not better
So

[Chorus]
Just look like you know
Look like you know something I should
I think I should go
I really feel like you want me to
Don't say that you want me
Don't pray the wish you can't make come true
Can I be replaced?
Cause that look on your face
Says "Baby I never knew"

[Chorus]
Just look like you know
Look like you know something I should
I think I should go
I really feel like you want me to
Don't say that you want me
Don't pray the wish you can't make come true
Can I be replaced?
Cause that look on your face
Says "baby I never knew"
