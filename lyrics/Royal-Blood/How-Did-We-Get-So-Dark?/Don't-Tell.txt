[Verse 1]
Everybody saw you get your coat
And everybody heard your bad excuse for leaving
Say Im going out for a smoke
No one has to know about our little secret

Meet you there
In the dark
I wont say anything
If you dont

[Chorus]
So dont tell
I swear I wont tell on you
On you
Dont tell
I swear I wont tell

[Verse 2]
Used to have a heart of gold
Now Im staying up at night
Your dirty little dreamer
Always ready to reload
At your command
Wish I could keep you

Synchronised
On demand
As we fantasise
What they cant know

[Chorus]
Oh, dont tell
I swear I wont tell on you
On you
Dont tell
I swear I wont tell

[Bridge]
I know its hard to bear
Hiding everywhere
Trying to forget
Keeping it on the down-low

I wish wed skip a beat
Give up this hide-and-seek
Think I just changed my mind
Lets just let everybody know

[Chorus]
Dont tell
I swear I wont tell on you
On you
Dont tell
I swear I wont tell on you
On you
Dont tell
I swear I wont tell
