[Verse 1]
She's creeping
Into my bloodstream
Then crawling
Out dead as a battery
Then it sinks in
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
It's so boring
Being what you want me to be

[Chorus]
Cause I've stopped listening
I'm just waiting for an answer to a question that I already know
I'll let you down
Words are so cheap
But lately I've been feeling like I'm always living in your shadow
When you're not around

[Verse 2]
So don't miss what makes you so miserable
Did my message send?
God knows I'll send it again

[Chorus]
Cause I've stopped listening
I'm just waiting for an answer to a question that I already know
I'll let you down
Words are so cheap
But lately I've been feeling like I'm always living in your shadow
When you're not around
You're not around

[Chorus]
I've stopped listening
I'm just waiting for an answer to a question that I already know
I'll let you down
Words are so cheap
But lately I've been feeling like I'm always living in your shadow
When you're not around

[Outro]
Yeah she's creeping (ooh)
Into my bloodstream (ooh)
Yeah she's creeping (ooh)
Into my bloodstream (ooh)
She's creeping
Now you're not around
You're not around
