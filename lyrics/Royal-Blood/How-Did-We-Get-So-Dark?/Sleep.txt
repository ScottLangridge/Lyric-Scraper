[Verse 1]
I don't wanna sleep
'Cause I've had enough
Of the same ugly dream
I just can't switch it off

Now I don't want to know
'Cause I'm sick of the sound
Misery's on repeat
Now you're hanging around

[Pre-Chorus]
But I need some medication
Tell me you've got what I need
I know you've got the cure
Antidote hidden up your sleeve

[Chorus]
I just can't help myself
Thinking you're with someone else
Sick to the bone
I don't wanna sleep
I read the warning sign
You said I'd be alright
Left on my own
I don't wanna sleep

[Verse 2]
I've waited so long
Forever counting down
Thinking of all the ways
I could get you back around

[Pre-Chorus]
But I need some medication
Tell me you've got what I need
I know you've got the cure
Antidote hidden up your sleeve

[Chorus]
I just can't help myself
Thinking you're with someone else
Sick to the bone
I don't wanna sleep
I read the warning sign
You said I'd be alright
Left on my own
I don't wanna sleep

[Bridge]
I don't wanna sleep
I don't wanna sleep
I can't switch it off
Think I've had enough
I can't switch it off
I think I've had enough

[Chorus]
I just can't help myself
Thinking you're with someone else
Sick to the bone
I don't wanna sleep
I read the warning sign
You said I'd be alright
Left on my own
I don't wanna sleep

[Outro]
I don't wanna sleep
'Cause I've had enough
Of the same ugly dream
I just can't switch it off
