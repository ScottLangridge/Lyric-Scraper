[Verse 1]
I saw it coming
Like the shadow on the wall
You started running
Then everything turned cold
How did I become a lookalike
Of someone you used to love?
Someone you used to love

[Chorus]
So dark
How did something so sweet tear us apart?
Oh, on a sinking ship with a heavy heart
Ooohhh
How did we get so dark?

[Verse 2]
Nobody warned you
The tables would turn
And I could have told you
Everything you've learnt
Would burn to dust
Now there's no one you can trust
Just someone you used to love
Someone you used to love

[Chorus]
So dark
How did something so sweet tear us apart?
Oh, on a sinking ship with a heavy heart
Ooohhh
How did we get so dark?

[Outro]
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
How'd we get so dark?
