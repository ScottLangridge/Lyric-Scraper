My motivation is gone too soon
Good vibrations all over you
Act like you mean it, you mean it
You gotta story you never tell
Down in the Delta, they're ringing bells
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind, I'm on my way
I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

Cause Im the super soaker, red white and blew em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I dont mind sentimental girls at times
Miss dont walk away, walk away

The flags are flying across the Plains
I got a secret picking in my brain
I wanna see you, see you
Yes, the sign is on my face
I dont know my home
I dont know my place
I just wanna be there, be there

Cause Im the super soaker, red white and blew em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I dont mind sentimental girls at times
Miss dont walk away, walk away
I dont mind sentimental girls at times
Miss dont walk away, whoa oh oh

I dont mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

I dont mind sentimental girls at times
Miss dont walk away, walk away
I dont mind sentimental girls at times
Miss dont walk away, oh oh oh oh
