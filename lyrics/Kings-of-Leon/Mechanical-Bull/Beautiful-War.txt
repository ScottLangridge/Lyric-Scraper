Bite your tongue
Dont let us end here
Everybodys been here
At least once before
Weve been here more

Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
Ive seen it all go and comeback around
And Ive heard the sound

Tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is doing my head in
I say love I dont need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for
Its a beautiful war

When I hold the warmth of your body
There is nobody that Id rather hold
Shattered and cold

Tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is making me crazy
I say love I dont need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for
Its a beautiful war

I say love you dont need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for
Its a beautiful war
Its a beautiful war
Its a beautiful war

I say love I say love
Dont need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for

I say love
Dont need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for

Its a beautiful war
Its a beautiful war
Its a beautiful war
Its a beautiful war
