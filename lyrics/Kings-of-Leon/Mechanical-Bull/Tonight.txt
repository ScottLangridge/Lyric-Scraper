Verse (1)
Tonight, somebodies lover
Is gonna pay for a sin
It's coming out it's coming out
I don't know, just what is leading me
Or if time is on my side
It's coming out, it's coming out

Chorus (1)
I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange and
It's something along the way (x2)

Well my seat, lights on broadway
I know it's gonna be a long night
It's coming out, It's coming out

Chorus (2)
I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange and
It's something along the way (x2)
A war in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
There's something along the way (x2)

Bridge (1)
Tonight, I'm gonna leave my body (x2)
Tonight, Somebody's lover is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming out, It's coming out

Chorus (3)
I don't know why I keep acting this way
Everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way, something along the way
