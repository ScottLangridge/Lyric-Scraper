Such a swine, lips like wine, But it don't matter to me.
Take a turn, before I burn, it don't matter to me.
Like a snake, I wake and I bake, it don't matter to me.
I can fuck or I can fight, it don't matter to me.

'Cause it's always the same,
And I'm always the same.

Uncle Sam, he looks god damned, But it don't matter to me.
I don't know where I'm gonna go, It don't matter to me.
You could bleed and stain my seat, it don't matter to me.

'Cause it's always the same,
And I'm always the same, whoa!

You're not a man everybody said, But it don't matter to me.
Dirty feet on my seat, it don't matter to me.
Break my heart, tear me apart, it don't matter to me, no, no.
I put a shine in your eye, it don't matter to me.

'Cause it's always the same,
And I'm always the same, whoa!
