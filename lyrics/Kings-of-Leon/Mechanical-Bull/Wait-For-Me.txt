Gona open my heart, out of the scares and listen up
Gonna do what I'm told, though I'm told and listen up
Take a shot in the rain, one for the pain and listen up
I travelled all the way

Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

Gonna start in the blow, something to blow and give it up
I saw the surprise, the look in your eyes, and gave it up
Gonna be who I am, be who I am, and give it up
I travelled all the way

Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, It's all better now, It's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
