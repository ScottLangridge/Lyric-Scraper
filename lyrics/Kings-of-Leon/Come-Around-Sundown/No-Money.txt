Won't you give me something I need
Won't you peel me off the street
Gonna wet my tongue
Spit me up and break me a fever
Give me something I can believe in
Give me something to walk me away
I'm a wasting time
And all in all a waste of a living
Waste of a living

Can't you see me walking alone
I've been down to the horns and back
And I'm way to tired
Of blowing out on a burning candle
I got no money but I want you so
I got no money but I want you so oh

I've got so much I cannot handle
Cannot handle
I cannot handle

We are all just pissing around
Cutting loose in this fucking town
I aint coming back
I've got my ticket, onto the next one
I got no money but I want you so
I got no money but I want you so oh
And I want, and I want, and I want, and I want ya
