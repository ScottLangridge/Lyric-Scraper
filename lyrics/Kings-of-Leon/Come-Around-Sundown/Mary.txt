Mary, if you wanna
I wave my right
I'll be on the corner
Just passin' time

No I won't, never once, make you cry
Just a kiss, oh I'll miss your goodbye
Ha ha ha ha ha

We'll go to the disco
We'll be a sight
Oh and we'll dance like boyfriends
In sheer delight

No I won't, never once, make you cry
Just a kiss, oh I'll miss your goodbye

No I won't, never once, make you cry
Just a kiss, oh I'll miss your goodbye
