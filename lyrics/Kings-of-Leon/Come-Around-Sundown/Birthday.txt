(1st Verse)
It's in the way she often calls me out
It's in the curve of your pretty gown
You come on legs and your pantyhose
You look so precious with your bloody nose

[Chorus:]
We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate
We gonna gather round, like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you

(2nd Verse)
Walking her home with the grassy field
Fallin and laughin at the drinks we spilled
Just one of those nights that I have to share
She's in a daze, without a care

[Chorus:]
We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate
We gonna gather round, like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you

(Instrumental)

(Repeat Chorus)
