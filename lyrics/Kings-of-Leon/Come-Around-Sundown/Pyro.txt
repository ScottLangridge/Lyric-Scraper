(1st Verse)

Single  book of matches, gonna burn whose standing in the way

Burning down the mountain, better call on  the fire brigade

Bury all the pictures and tell the kids that Im ok

Even if  Im forgotten youll remember me for a day

[Chorus:]

I, I dont wanna be your cornerstone, I

(2nd Verse)

All the black inside me is slowly seeping from the bone

Everything I cherished is slowly dying or is gone

Little shaking babies and drunkards seem to all agree

Once the show gets started its bound to be a sight to see

[Chorus:]

I, I wont ever be your cornerstone

I, I dont wanna be holding on

I, I wont ever be your cornerstone, I

Want your love,  can you feel it? (4x)

I, I wont ever be your cornerstone

I, I dont wanna be holding on

I, I wont ever be your cornerstone

I, I dont wanna be holding on, I
