When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there
It's in the water, it's where you came from
It's in the water, it's where you came from
When the crowd began to wonder
And they cry to see your face

It's in the water, it's in the story of where you came from
The sons and daughters in all their glory, it's gonna shape them
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

You're the rose that was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away

It's in the water, it's in the story of where you came from
Your sons and daughters in all their glory it's gonna shape them
And when they clash and come together, and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

(it's in the water, it's where you came from)
Where you came from
(it's in the water, it's where you came from)
Where you came from

And when they clash and come together and start rising
Just drink the water where you came from, where you came from
