(1st Verse)
Running with the street lights
Laughing at the grave
He swears he's gonna give it up
It's never gonna be enough
I just wanna be there 
When your all alone
Thinking 'bout a better day
When ya had it in your bones

(Chorus)
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end

(2nd Verse)
I see you in the evening
Sitting on your throne
And praying with the fireball, 
And posted it up against the wall
I just wanna hold you
Take you by your hand
And tell you that you're good enough
Tell you that it's gonna be tough

(Chorus)
 This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
'Cause I 'ain't got a home


(3rd Verse)
Running from the street lights
Shinning on the grave
Once you've had the good stuff
Never gonna fill you up
I wanna be the one who
Gives 'em all the world
And gives 'em all a feel of it
Just a little taste of it

(Chorus)
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
'Cause I 'ain't got a home
I'm out here all alone
'Cause I 'ain't got a home 
Out here all alone
Said I 'ain't got a home
Out here all alone
I 'ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
I 'ain't got a home...
