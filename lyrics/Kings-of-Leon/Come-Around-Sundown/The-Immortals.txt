(1st Verse)

The open road, the path of greatness, it's at your fingers
Go be the one, who keeps on fighting, go be the stranger
Just put your foot, in front the other, crow like the rooster
Be all and all, together something
Fear is a danger,
I say

[Chorus:]
Spill out on the streets of stars, and ride away
Find out what you are, face to face

(2nd Verse)
The windows are, a perfect picture, they're always changing
Go on get lost, jump in the waters, when they are raging
I say

[Chorus:]
Spill out on the streets of stars, and ride away
Find out what you are, face to face
Once you've had enough, carry on
Don't foget to love, before your gone

[Chorus:] x1

(Repeat Chorus)
