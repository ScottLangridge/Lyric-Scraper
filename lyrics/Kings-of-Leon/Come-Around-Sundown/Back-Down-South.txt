Come on out and dance,
If you get the chance,
We're gonna spit on the rivals.
All I wanna know,
Is how far you wanna go,
Fighting for survival.

Underneath the stars,
Where we parked the car,
Ain't showing signs of stopping.
Pretty little girls,
Naked to their curls,
Ready to lay in the coffin.
If you wanna go,
I'm gonna go,
I got a fire burning.
Come on take my hand,
When we see the band,
Baby's gonna be a big one.
Baby's gonna be a big one.

If you see the lights,
And we hear the fights,
It's gonna be a stunner.
I've got something here,
If you give me one more beer,
I'm gonna call a runner.
I don't want to say,
What I have to say,
Babe I'm a' kicking off now.
If you wanna go,
I'm gonna go,
I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.

If you wanna go,

I'm going back down south now.
Go on take my hand,
I'm going back down south now.
Wait 'til you see the light,
And we hear those fights,
I'm going back down south now.
I don't want to know,
How far you wanna go,
I'm going back down south now.

I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going back down south now.
