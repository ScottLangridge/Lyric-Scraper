Beneath the dance hall lights,
You seem a girl so sound,
Lights up the ground,
If you give up New York,
I'll give you Tenessee,
The only place to be
The cowboy's burning eyes,
Don't like the sight of me
Just straight enough to breed
I like your point of view,
So don't you shy away
Ride out the wave (3x)
(Instrumental)
Ride out the wave (2x)
You had me holding on
Another time and place
Ride out the wave
Buried yourself away
The one and only face
Ride out the wave (3x)
