[Verse 1]
Out here looking for the good life
Tongue in my cheek and ya back in my knife
I keep pushing through, my eyes right on you
Everyone says you should get away, fast as you can
But I know you'll stay, you never fall behind
It's always on your mind

You're somewhere I wanna go
Nice and swift as we take it slow
Well were on our way
Don't never hesitate
I'll hide in the dark in the back of [?]
And laugh a little louder as we go insane
No time to waste
I never come too late
[Chorus]
If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

[Hook]
Oh, I believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it

[Verse 2]
You're a misfit and I'm your freak
Dance all night till our knees go weak
We could shut this place down
No one else is around
I try hard to understand
The crush of the world in the palm of your hand
You know we sit just right
Let's run away from the night

[Chorus]
If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

[Hook]
Well babe, I believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it

[Verse 3]
Tongue in your cheek and back in my knife
Out here looking for the good life
Keep on pushing through, I got eyes on you
Baby, you know that we're on our way
Misfit and freak every single day
[?], let's go take it all

[Chorus]
If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

[Hook-Variation]
I know you can see it, I'll believe it
You can see it, I believe it

[Outro]
We're here for a moment
So let's own it
For a moment, so let's own it

It's here for the taking
Why you waiting?
This good loving is worth making
