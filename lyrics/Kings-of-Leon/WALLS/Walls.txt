[Verse 1]
I can get there on my own
You can leave me here alone
Im just tryin to do whats right
Oh, a man aint a man unless hes fought the fight

[Verse 2]
I could never point you out
Waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know whats right then youll walk away
[Chorus]
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Verse 3]
One by one I'm seein' them fall
Some just dont show up at all
Im just here to fight the fire
Oh, a man aint a man unless he has desire

[Chorus]
And the walls come down
And the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Bridge]
You tore out my heart
And you threw it away
The Western girl with Eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now theres nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way

[Chorus]
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

[Bridge]
You tore out my heart
You threw it away
The western girl with Eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now theres nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way
