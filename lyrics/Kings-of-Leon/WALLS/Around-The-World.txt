[Verse 1]
My corner, you'll find me every day
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
Gonna tag along, I'll set the way
And tried to get high
What price you gonna pay

[Chorus]
Been around the world been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
[Verse 2]
Keep dancing, like its ya last time
We're so thin ice, swimming in the light
When the curtain falls, I'm on your scene
"What sweet surprise" she said to me

[Chorus-Variation]
Been around the world been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
Take it all the way, take it all the way
All the way
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
