[Verse 1]
Oh, I wanna take you in
If you come around I come a running
Once through the fire again
The weather, the wind is picking up
Every little string is you
Plucked from the vine, ahead of its time
Only if you want me to

[Chorus]
Wild, my breath of wonder
Child, running like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild is for the open
[Verse 2]
Spent the night on a riverside
Trying to recall my name
Careful of [?] sinking in
Something hasn't gone insane
The step of the light comes sweeping in
Harsh enough to see it through
Something in the air and the water tonight
Rising from the depths of you

[Chorus]
Wild, my breath of wonder
Child, running like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild is for the open

[Chorus]
Wild, my breath of wonder
Child, running like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild is for the open
