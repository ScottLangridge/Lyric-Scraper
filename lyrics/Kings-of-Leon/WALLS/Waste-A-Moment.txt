All the way from Waco to WE-HO with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven
[Verse 2]
Sexy was her boyfriend, with no kin, always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back at her claw
He's a live wire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
Hes a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven
