[Verse 1]
I see the grass beneath me
I smell the winter sky
And think to myself
Don't pass me by
You dance in strange conditions with strangers of the night
I see you're crazy and so am I

You bled out red and blue
The boys of NYU, they saw you coming from miles away
Nothing is quite as homey, we dive in sunny days
I see you Kenny, you castaway
[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over, anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over, anymore

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, that made the city
[?] on christmas eve and all the good times, we've ever seen
The roles we played together
The slaps across my face
My face brings new reason you write the scene

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

[Bridge]
My angel hovers over
The light comes crashing in
I know its how this here story ends
I'll hang around forever, until you cut me down
I'm crossed and ready to face the crowd

[Chorus]
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore
