With hands in the air you look like the girl at the fare with the bubbly eyes.
Stonewashed shoe pulling at a rock but the rock don't compromise,
Come up to me say why are you so skinny and pretty for a boy?,
Said thanks for the insults and compliments
You'll never forget my face no more

I can't hardly reach you and I know it's getting harder to be you.
So i'll be dropping you where nobody knows,
City ought to take you,
It would take a little second to break you
So i'll be dropping you where nobody knows,
I'll be dropping you where nobody knows.

Looking pretty keen sitting on a swing,
That don't mean a thing at all,
Your hair's on my feet,
Say barkin like a pack of dogs,
Siccin' on a coon in a stall.

Take it for your word,
Take it for a ride,
Take it for the evening dead or alive,
Warming up the car packing as the pilots play.

I can't hardly reach you and I know it's getting harder to be you,
So i'll be dropping you where nobody knows,
City ought to take you,
It would take a little second to break you,
So i'll be dropping you where nobody knows,
I'll be dropping you where nobody knows......... Jessica........

Head like a stone,
Stoned like a rock,
Cloggin' up your nose again,
Papa's a searching,
Devil is a knocking,
Chills runnin' up my skin,
Here goes now.
