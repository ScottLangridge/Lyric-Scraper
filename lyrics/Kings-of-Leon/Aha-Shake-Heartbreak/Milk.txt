Salty leave, salty leave

Tell me the one about the friend you knew,
And the last goodnight that we toasted too.

Salty leave,
Stay for me, stay for me

We drank wine in the matineee
And the spotlight showed what I chased away

Stay for me

She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She had problems with drinking milk
And being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bartend you party

Kill me, Kill me

I called and I called, but I can't get through,
Said he's on his own, but his own is you

Kill me
