Huffman don't take no nonsense,
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle,
And the red man's fire in his eye.

You with your switchblade posse,
I'll get my guns from the south,
We'll take to the yard like a cockfight
Four kicks whose strutting now.

This party is overrated,
But there ain't shit else to do,
She's a lovin' on the boy from the city
I'll be lovin' him under my shoe.
