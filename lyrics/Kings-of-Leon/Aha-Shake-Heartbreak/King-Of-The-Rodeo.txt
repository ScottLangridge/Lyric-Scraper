He's so the purity, a shaven and a mourning,
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray

Straight in the picture pose
He's coming round to meet you

And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay

Me and your cold, driving in the snow,
Let the good times roll let the good times roll,
Cowgirl king of the rodeo let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor,
Hold on not my fairy tale you're trying to start

Take off your overcoat you're staying for the weekend,
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drinking in the park

Good time to roll on
