Walking like ur sucking velvet snow
Walking like ur sucking velvet snow
Starting on your story and go go
Ohh walking like ur sucking velvet snow

Going cos you're sweating on our floor
Going cos you're sweating on our floor
Acting like you've never gone so far
Ohh going cos you're sweating on our floor

Then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go

Hope that smoke aint getting to ur face
Hope that smoke aint getting to ur face
Showing off ur sunday streak of lace
Hope that smoke aint getting to ur face

Then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go

Then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go
