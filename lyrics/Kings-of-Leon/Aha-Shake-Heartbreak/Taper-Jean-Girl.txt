Aha shake taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha shake bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha shake black as night on a Sunday

Clits watch their bodies, no room for make up,
I think he's tasted the watcher

Heartbreak knockin' 'em down like the 7th grade,
Heartbreak, cigarettes and songs, with a winters chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter, and a run away

Aha shake tapered jean girl kills me
