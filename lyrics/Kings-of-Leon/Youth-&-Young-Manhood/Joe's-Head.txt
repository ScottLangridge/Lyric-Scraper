Blistered cracked and bleeding
Cold no one should know
Rain falls down a freezing
And sticking like a snow
Lingering suspicions
Screaming in my head
Lies all mixed up with omissions
Aw welcome home again
It's too late for apologies they're falling at my feet

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
Then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
Caught him laying with my girlfriend
Now they're both dead, people can be so cold when they're dead

Calling all the neighbors
Time to make amends
Whiskey floods the table
Aw good friends 'til the end
They're making silly faces and it's tasting bitter sweet
