Spiral Staircase goin' down,
Paint your body red and brown,
On our knees, we'll feast on tha s** show.
Spiral Staircase! Spiral Staircase!
Greasy haircuts, a German Chinese girl,
Is gone keep ya'll busy, tuggin' at my curl,
A get your ass together,
You better walk, walk, walk, a by walking, we cannot run!
A they all came to party, and there's four to every stall,
It gets frus-ta-ratin', a just a pissin' on this wall,
Seems like there's another story bangin',
Around every step you fake.
