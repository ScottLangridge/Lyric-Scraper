Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers that are hanging out at the bar in the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down on every thing that the momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine, help you feel not so strange

[Chorus:]
Said old Pa, "She don't get off, unless somebody standing near her."
"And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line, cause all tied to the chair."
I said, "Lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten."

All the bubbas got their heads in a nod,
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are they tab their worm in a slab,
Doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight, ah tonight, tonight, tonight

[Chorus:]
Ah maybe tonight
Said old Pa, "She don't get off, unless somebody standing near her."
"And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line, hands all tied to the chair."
I said, "Lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten."
Comes home on call, isn't that peace,
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth
He's spitting out his teeth

I said, "Lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound, like a tranny on a ten." [Repeated]
