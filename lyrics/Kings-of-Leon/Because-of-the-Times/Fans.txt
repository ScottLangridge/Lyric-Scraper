Home grown
Rock to the rhythm, and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
You can play with me

And all the bros
Try for the girls, that try for tearing this tight clothes
She got a hiding all he has is his asshole (this one too)
She'll be bothering me-eee-ee

Pretty hairdos
And those lipstick kisses, blown yeah that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see

Now take me down
Don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
Don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound on me.. Here

All of London Sings
Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those rainy days they ain't so bad when you're the King
The King they want to see

Home grown
So rock to the rhythm, and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
You can play with me-ee here

And her hair-do
He knows the lipstick kisses, oh yeah that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who's moving you
The only one you see

All of London Sings
Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those rainy days they ain't so bad when you're the King
The King they want to see
