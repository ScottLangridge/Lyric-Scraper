My cold, cold, sailor heart says get on your way
I aint to proud to say but that's how I'm made.
I'll be that person 'till my dying day
I try so awful hard, but I can't change.

From runways to the road, I ramble alone
This thumbnail sized of a heart is black as coal
Your beauty, it still brings me to my knees
Don't waste a tear on me, it's my disease

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I burn off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

Those preppy boys in blue
That make fun of us
So we take it to the streets
Cause we want to be cussed
But we're not here to make your children bleed
We're here to come around with the tumble weed

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I burn off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Now get her, go get her!

Don't take these boots off me when you're thinking I'm dead
I'll still be running from the demons in my head
I'll be that person 'till my dying day
I try so awful hard, but I can't change

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I burn off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't need no...
