I wanna say here's to me gonna change the world
Now I wanna play 'til they kicking down the door
Now I'll be alright as long as I ain't seen it all
Now I'mma hold you tight to that night we had a ball, we had a ball

Here's to the kids out there smoking in the streets
They're way too young but I'm way too old to preach
They know it all but they still ain't seen the truth
Just play my song and I'll show it all to you

Either way you caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me with my pants down

My papa's slave had to go and fight the war
He'd beat 'em all then he took 'em all to court
My papa called and he said "you remember me?"
Now he's working awful hard in his factory

Either way you caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me with my pants down

We ain't even been to the ocean
We been running barefoot the stream
We been running barefoot through the stream
We ain't even been to the oh

(Lowering audible)
We aint't even been to the ocean...
We been running barefoot the stream...
We been running barefoot through the stream...
We aint even been to the ocean...
