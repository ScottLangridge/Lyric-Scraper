Strain
Living with a name
They get the best of me
But I'm no walker away
No complaint
I got much to gain
So they keep testing me
And I keep feeding their face
And they could go
Off and hit the road
And what would I care
Hell I ain't going nowhere
I got the reigns
And courage I was made of
They got the fake love

So I know
I must show
It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my soul

Pearls
And necklaces and girls
And all the pretty things
I ain't seeking to have
It's safe to say
If I don't get this out of me
I might quite easily
End up dead or just mad
Cross my t's, try to dot my i's
But that's blinding me
I ain't living that way
I roll my sleeves
To make me a better man of me
Or I might easily
Just give up on the show

It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my soul

I must show
It's my show
I must go
With my soul
By my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my soul

It's my show (2x)
