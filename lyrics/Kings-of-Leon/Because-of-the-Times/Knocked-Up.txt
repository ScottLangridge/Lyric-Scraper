I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coup deville
She bubbled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says, no
She's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take
This taken gonna shape me

People call us renegades
Because we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
Because people are getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says, no
I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go

People call us renegades
Because we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
Because people are getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says, no
I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

And her daddy doesn't think he quite knows
Where we gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we gonna go?
Where we gonna go?
Where we gonna go?
Where we gonna go?

They gonna call us renegade, woah, oh, oh
Feel like we're living on this town, woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh

And I don't care if you don't win

I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a coupe de ville
She buckled up on navy
She don't care what her mama said, no
She's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take
Because taken gonna shape me

Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
