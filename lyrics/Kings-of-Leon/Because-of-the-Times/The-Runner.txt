Hard times as we go
We know what times will change
I talked to Jesus
Jesus says I'm okay

Pushin and jumpin
Jumpin the mountain range
And in a railroad
Railroad from Hell to Maine

While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacin on the phone
Sneakin on the train come back

Awful sick and tired of the gang
She comes from nothing
Hopin for a taste of fame
She's got a birthmark
A birthmark the shape of Maine

While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacin on the phone
Sneakin on the train come back

Awful sick and tired of the gang
And it's cold and it's cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle
And it's cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle
And it's cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle

Hard times as we go
We know where times will change
I talk to Jesus
Jesus everyday

Hard times as we go
