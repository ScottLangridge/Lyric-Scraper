I've been working awful hard for you
But you don't say, you just hold your breath
So I can't touch what I haven't yet

It's a dark path and a heck of a toll
If she could feel me like she did before

Sharing a smile
So far from home

And we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making up songs
Making me lie
Happy alone
