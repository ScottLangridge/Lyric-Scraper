Ohhh she's only seventeen
Wine and Whine and wound up over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the scene
Brothers frightened, when's the baby gonna sleep
Hidden ship two sails away

Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's a tick of our time and the tic in her head that made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby, I could call you, dammit, it's a one in a million
Oh it's the rollin of your Spanish tongue that made me wanna stay

Oh she's only seventeen
Whine whine whine, weep over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the street
Brothers fighting, when's the baby gonna sleep
Heaving ship too sails away

Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's a tick of our time and the tic in her head that made me feel so strange
Said I could call you baby, I could call you, dammit, it's a one in a million
Oh it's the rollin of her Spanish tongue that made me wanna stay

I could call you baby, I could call you, dammit, it's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of your Spanish tongue that made me wanna stay
