What a night for a dance
You know I'm a dancing machine
With the fire in my bones
And the sweet taste of kerosene
I get lost in the night
So high don't wanna come down
To face the loss
Of the good thing that I have found

Woo hoo hoooo
Woo hoo hoooo

In the dark of the night
I can hear you callin' my name
With the hardest of hearts
I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke
And I ask If you're ever around
Even though it was me
Who drove us right in the ground

See the time we shared
It was precious to me
But all the while
I was dreamin' of revelry

Gonna run baby run
Like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind in my back
I wont ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along
That had a hold of my heart
But the demon and me
Were the best of friends from the start

So the time we shared it
Was precious to me
All the while
I was dreamin' of revelry

Dreamin' of revelry

And I told myself,
Oh the way you go
It rained so hard,
It felt like snow
Everything came tumbling down on me
In the back of the woods,
It was dark as night
Palest pale,
Of the old moonlight
Everything just felt so incomplete

Dreamin' of revelry
Dreamin' of revelry
Dreamin' of revelry
Dreamin' of revelry
