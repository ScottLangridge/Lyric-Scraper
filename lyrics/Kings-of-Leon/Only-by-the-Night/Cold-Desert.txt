Waiting for a light
To come on
That's when I know
That your alone
It's cold in the desert
Water that is easy around?
Special for girls
Without a sound?

You told me you loved me,
That I'd never die alone
Hand over you
Heart lets go home
Everyone noticed,
Everyone has seen the sign
I've always been known
To cross lines

I've never ever cryed
When I was feeling down
I've always been scared
Of the sound
Jesus don't love me
No one ever carryed my low?
I'm to young to feel this old

Is it you? Is it me?
No body knows no body sees
No body but me
