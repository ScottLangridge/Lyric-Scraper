Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman, probly thinks she's cooler than you
A hay ride at 5, everybodys comin around
So go press you skirt, word is there's a new girl in town...

I call shotgun, you can play your Rnb tunes
The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon, it always comes a little too soon
The land of the free, freshened up from babyfaced shame
Put your eyes on me, and I know a place that we can't get away...

Just say I want you, just exactly like I used to
Cos baby this is ooooonly bringin me down...

Home-boy's so proud, finally got the video proof
The night vision shows she was only duckin the truth
It's heavy I know, black guy with the gift down below
A choke and a gag, she spit up n came back for more...

She sed I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is ooooonly bringin me down...
She sed I want you

I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is oooonly bringin me down...
I said I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is oooonly bringin me down
