(H. Knight/A. Hammond)
I'm so tired of these men trying to impress me with nothing
The same old routine and the smooth fancy talking
Now I know and believe that I found it for real
Cause' you're good and your kind
And you care how I feel
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never satisfied
And I know what I like and I like what I see in your eyes
Oh oooh you're so beautiful
I've been pushed I've been pulled I've been put out and trod on
Just by takin' my chances
I finally caught on
When I see in your eyes all the love shining through
I'm glad I held out for somebody like you
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never satisfied
And I know what I like, and I like what I see in your eyes
Heaven must have sent you I know
You're so good to me, I feel good with you
I'd be such a fool to let go
There's something about you I can't live without you
I've had fast talking good looking men at my door
Now I'm a wiser woman
Than I was before
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never never never satisfied
And I know what I like, and I like what I see in your eyes baby
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted by the danger
But I was never never never satisfied
And I know what I like, and I like what I see in your eyes
Oh yeah
Yes yes yeah
I've had a tall dark handsome man yeah
Oooh
Yeah
Oooh oooh oooh
