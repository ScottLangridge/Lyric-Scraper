Wake up love
Wake up baby
I want to tell you
Let me say
Dreaming never looked so true
One word ain't enough
Heaven's finding eyes in you
How can I say love?

Many smilers
Lie to each other
Children hide with pretty words
So many times we seem to find
Children play too rough
Never too late for what we are made for
How can I say love?

All this feeling here inside
One word ain't enough
The way to say it seems to hide
How can I say love?

How do we wind up
Why do we wind up
So alone?

How many roads do we gotta travel on
Till we find out we're already home?
Already home

All this feeling here inside
One word ain't enough
The way to say it seems to hide
How can I say love?
