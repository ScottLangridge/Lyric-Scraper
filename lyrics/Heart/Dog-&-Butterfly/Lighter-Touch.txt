Look at me the answer is so clear
Lying close by the fireplace
I wish you could see yourself this way my love
With the firelight upon your face

Ain't it strange how love put things together
One like you... someone like me
But no one ever moved me like the way you do
Held against your love I am weak

Before us now our dream of love is playing
A butterfly rising from the flame
You and me don't need no chains
Since this feeling came to us
A touch of love a lighter touch

A lighter touch than hands of love through time
Reaching up to have and to hold
You know I'll always stay if I am free to go
You know I'll take your love into my soul

Before us now our dream of love is playing
A butterfly rising from the flame
You and me don't need no chains
Since this feeling came to us
This touch of love
This lighter, lighter touch of love
This lighter, lighter touch.
