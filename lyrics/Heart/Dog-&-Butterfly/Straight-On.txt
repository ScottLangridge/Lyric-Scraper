Quite some time... I been sittin' it out
Didn't take no chances... I was a prisoner of doubt
I knocked down the wailin' wall.... It ain't no sin
I... Got... The feel of fortune... Deal me in....
Chorus:
I'm comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger... Now I'm comin' through...
Straight on... Straight on for you...
Straight on for you
Now, I know... I got to play my hand
What the winner don't know... The gambler understands..
My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend
I'll take my chances on you... Again and again...... Again..
Repeat Chorus
