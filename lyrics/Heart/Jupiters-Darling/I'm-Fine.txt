Anyway, as I was saying before we got all blown away ~ oh man
Flash flood in a paper cup ~ no chance to study up ~ oh man
What's the chad confetti stuff shooting out the TV is it Y2K or it's it World War 3?
The dogs of reason ran away ~ way into the fray ~ and whoosh the hell we have to pay
Have you heard?

(chorus)

As I was saying, I'm fine
Things don't make sense to me all the time
I'm hanging right on that line
As I was saying, oh I'm fine
Midsummer lifeline in stone crimson love
Slo-mo explosion come down form the above
Tune out the noise of the tumbling world
If you can hear me its' all in a word, have you heard?
Anyway, as I was saying, scuse me for just a minute please ~ oh man
I'm OK I'm OK I'll come around right after I have this little break down
