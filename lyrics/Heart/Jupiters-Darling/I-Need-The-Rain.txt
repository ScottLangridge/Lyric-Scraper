Long have I wandered so far from home
Come to a place I have never known
Gone too deep underground
Gone to far better turn around
I've been running away
I've been running away away

[Chorus:]

Don't you know I need the rain to hide my tears
To cover me ~ wash me clear
Don't you know I need the rain to hide my tears
I'm in my cloud ~ I'm not here
No killing sun to know where I go
No no killing sun to know where I go

Stop the world ~ make it wait
Don't you burn my eyes in the fires of day
Let me stay dark and safe
And this crazy rain is my last escape
I've been running away
I've been running away away

[Chorus:]
