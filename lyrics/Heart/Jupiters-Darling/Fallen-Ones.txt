Born on the edge of a borderline
Born on the edge of a borderline
In the simmering summer of sweet blue fire
In the simmering summer of sweet blue fire
Now you walk on the cold cold wind
Now you walk on the cold cold wind
Nothing left of your light
Nothing left of your light
The living sun just falls away leaving only day ~ day for night
The living sun just falls away leaving only day ~ day for night

Again and again the comrades fall
Again and again the comrades fall
The tears roll down and the wounded crawl
The tears roll down and the wounded crawl
In this heartless crazy world the wounds just burn like fire
In this heartless crazy world the wounds just burn like fire
Light a light for the fallen ones
Light a light for the fallen ones
Light a light and hold it ~ hold it high
Light a light and hold it ~ hold it high

Your burning star turned to midnight sun
Your burning star turned to midnight sun
I will stay alive for the fallen ones
I will stay alive for the fallen ones
Dancing with the smoke of your devastated flame
Dancing with the smoke of your devastated flame
Dancing with the smoke dancing with the rain
Dancing with the smoke dancing with the rain
So cold being here again
So cold being here again
So I call your name ~ I call ~ I call your name
So I call your name ~ I call ~ I call your name
