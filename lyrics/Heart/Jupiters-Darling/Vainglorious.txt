Rock it up baby get ready to fight
Get ready to light up the whole damn night
Jupiters darling standing in the ring
You got your heart set on being king of kings
Slowly like a drop of tupelo honey rolling on down some little girls money

[Chorus:]

Here he comes ~ vainglorius
First serve first come ~ vainglorius
Dig me now ~ avoid the rush ~ vainglorius

Offer up all that devil delight
Keep the camera on the money in the big spotlight
All the other kids think you're so extreme
You don't want sugar baby but you'll take the cream
Bundle up baby said the fortune teller cause vanity main is gonna bring some big weather

[Chorus:]
