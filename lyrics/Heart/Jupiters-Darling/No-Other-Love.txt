No other love, darlin' I'm flyin'.
No other love, darlin' I'm flyin'.
And I can go, I can go anywhere.
But no other love can take me there.
(Ohhhhh)
No other love, darlin' I'm flyin'.
No, no other love, darlin' I'm flyin'.
And I can go, I can go anywhere.
No other love can take me there.
(Mmmmmm)
Darlin' I'm flyin'.
Darlin' I'm flyin'.
I can go, I can go anywhere.
But no other love can take me there.
(Mmm mmm)
No other love, darlin' I'm flyin'.
No other love, darlin' I'm flyin'
