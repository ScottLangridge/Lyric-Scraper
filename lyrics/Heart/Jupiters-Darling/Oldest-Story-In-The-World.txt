Kickin down the darkness
Kick it on down the drain
Kill the superstition
Gotta get a state of grace

[Chorus:]

It's the oldest story in the world
There is nowhere left to hide
So we take it all in stride
When there's no more asking why
There is nothing left to do
But love~baby love~baby love you

Crash the television
Thrash those games and fools
Gotta get a resolution
Better go go back to school

[Chorus:]

Fair-weather friends and fair-weather cool
Righteous the right buy all the bad news
Rich up the rich and dumb down the poor
Take it no more
