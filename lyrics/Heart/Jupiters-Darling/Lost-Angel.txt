As it was before shall it ever ever be
Hear it on the crying wind
Hear it weeping on the sea
Through the winter valley wild and through the darkest night
Here comes the evil news of the coming fight

So love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace
All through the storm let the tides release
Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace
All through the storm let the tides release

Come on down Lost Angel find us now
From the clouds above right down to the ground
Lost Angel come on down

Stardust yeah yeah we are and the willow is pushed to bend
Too much too much of man
And stardust we will be again

Oh love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace
All through the storm let the tides release
Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace
All through the storm let the tides release
