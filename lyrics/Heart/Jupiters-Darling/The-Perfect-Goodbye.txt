Do you see me ~ do I see you
And all the footprints we left in this room
A smile in the hall ~ framed on the wall
Do we way words that rise and fall like the circles of blue

Shoes on the floor ~ they're intertwined
Just like the touch we left behind
Walk through the door and say no more
Say no more easy alibis to put out the fire

[Chorus:]

It's the perfect goodbye
No time no tell ~ as from your lips the words that never fell
It's a simple farewell
No fight no flight ~ no live no die
No me no cry cry cry cry
No me no cry

Hang up the phone ~ I should have known
Better alone that killing time with fake valentines

[Chorus:]

I'll see you sometime ~ once in awhile
No partners in crime ~ just a face in the file

[Chorus:]
