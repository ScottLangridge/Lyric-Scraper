Lying right beside you all the things we done
This I didn't plan now I understand we're one
We belong together no more time to fight
Underneath the skin we can let it in and float it through the night
And I aint never been here before
And you you, you come and knock on my door

[Chorus:]

Floating down that moonlight river
Lighter than a child
Warmer than the seven breezes
Floating ~ floating down the Nile
Softer than the clouds around us
Filling up my eyes
Silky like your burning kisses
Floating ~ floating down the Nile
