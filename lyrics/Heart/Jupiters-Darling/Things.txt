Things aint what they used to be now I believe in all extremes
Things aint what they used to be and that won't change till we're a hundred and three
Let's never try to solve it babe ~ the equation of you plus me

Things aint what they used to be can you believe it all we've seen
Things aint what they used to be it's theme park living A to Z
Let's never try to solve it babe ~ the equation of you plus me

[Chorus:]

It's all the same we're here today yesterday is just a dream
It's all the same we figured out what to take and what to leave
For the honey bees

Things aint what they used to be no money and no guarantee
Things aint what they used to be our future's in a cup of China tea
Let's never try to solve it babe ~ the equation of you plus me

[Chorus:]
