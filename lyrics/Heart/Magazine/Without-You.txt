Well I can't forget this evening
Though your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes the
Sorrow show---yes it shows

And I can't forget tomorrow when I think
Of all your sorrow - when I had you there
And then let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
Yeah -- gotta know

I can't live- if living is without you
I can't give- I can't give anymore
I can't live -if living is without you
I can't give- I can't give anymore

Well I can't forget this evening
Though your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

I can't live- if living is without you
I can't give- I can't give anymore -no no more
(repeat)chorus
