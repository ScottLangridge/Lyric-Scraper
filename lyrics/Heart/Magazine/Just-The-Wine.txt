Once in a life
We lived in a sanctuary
A song could get us free
Slept behind the altar
Only the singer saw

Now it is gone, years on
Times we took alone
Stealing an hour, buying a night
It's hard on the telephone
Love outside the law
Jai tant reve du toi

Is it gone, this year
Is the song still in your ear
Were we only high
Just the wine
Only the times

When we're old
How will the story be told
Windswept smoke used by time
Waiting for the bus
Will that be us?

Do you recall my friend
We never thought we'd ever fall
When the salesman came to call
Selling our soul to buy
Sometimes it ain't no deal at all
Jai tant reve du toi
