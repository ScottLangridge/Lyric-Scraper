(D. Hitchings/S. Shifrin/M. Andes)
Through the mist
On the harbor
Dancing lights
On the water
Shadows move
I see you smiling again
When I reach out to touch you
Like a ghost
Looking through me
Sending chills
Deep into me
Shattered dreams
Falling like teardrops again
As you make me remember
Strangers of the heart
Always safe with words unspoken
Strangers of the heart
Don't take chances they'll get broken
No matter where you are
Hear me tonight I don't want to be strangers at heart
Broken glass
Of my mirror
Makes my eyes
See much clearer
You and I
Only a whisper away
Never telling each other
Strangers of the heart
Always safe with words unspoken
Strangers of the heart
Don't take chances they'll get broken
No matter where you are
Hear me tonight I don't want to be strangers at heart
Strangers of the heart
Always safe with words unspoken
Strangers of the heart
Don't take chances they'll get broken
No matter where you are
Hear me tonight I don't want to be strangers at heart
