Everytime I hear your voice on the phone
Everytime you leave me so long alone
Everytime I think that my heart's
Gonna break
You know at my door, you're back
On the make

If you hands were tied
If your eyes were closed
Anyway you dish it out
I just couldn't say no

Easy target
Open season and you are the reason
Easy target
I got caught you are such a good shot now
Easy target
Hard to believe I'm so reckless and naive
Easy target
Easy for me to let you do what you please

Maybe I'm a heartbreak waiting to be
Maybe lady luck is laughing with me
I'm an easy target
Deep in the dark
You took your aim
You hit your mark

If you hands were tied
If your eyes were closed
Anyway you dish it out
I just couldn't say no

Easy target
Open season and you are the reason
Easy target
I got caught you are such a good shot now
Easy target
Hard to believe I'm so reckless and naive
Easy target
Easy for me to let you do what you please

If you hands were tied
If your eyes were closed
Anyway you dish it out
I just couldn't say no

Easy target
Open season and you are the reason
Easy target
I got caught you are such a good shot now
Easy target
Hard to believe I'm so reckless and naive
Easy target
Easy for me to let you do what you please
