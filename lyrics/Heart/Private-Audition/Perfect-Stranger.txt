Stranger are you waiting
For someone to come down and love you in time
Stranger you're debating
Can you get the words in your head
And you're heart to rhyme

Feel like a perfect stranger
You been gone so long
It's come down to feeling
And you're feeling wrong

I know how you want to, you're a hero
Under the stars you are wild
Well, come on, I want you I'm telling you
You're only a stranger a little while

Feel like a perfect stranger, you been gone so long
But you still know how to make it baby
You got to make it strong

It just got too heavy to carry
It all came down
But you're still alive, you're still seething
Just in time, you found your time
And your timimg is perfect stranger
What it gets down to, you, you, it's you baby
Only you
Only you
Your timing is perfect stranger
You been gone too long
But it's your time to make baby
Come on and make it strong now
