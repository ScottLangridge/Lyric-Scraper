Hey baby I'm talking to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try yeah
You're bangin' your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance... One love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on
Just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away
Anything you want - we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never - Never
Never - Never run away

Hey baby you know it's true
Why you bother lying when you know
That you want it too
Don't you dare deny me
Walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance... One love
Hold me down never let me go

We can't go on
Just running away
If we wait any longer
We will surely never get away
Anything you want - we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never - Never
Never - Never run away
Never - Never
Never - Never run away

Hey baby I'm talking to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try yeah
You're bangin' your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance... One love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on
Just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away

Oo oo Never
Oo oo Never

We can't go on Never
We can't go on Never

Oo oo Never
Oo oo Never

We can't go on Never
We can't go on Never
