You look just like Sylvia, well you look like her to me
The way she wore her hair then, oh, the way she used to be
I've not seen her for a long time, though I've heard she's still around
Her father's living with some girl who's a year younger than her
She's living in the country now, yeah, oh, she's trying to get better
Her beauty was her only crime, yeah, I remember Sylvia

So keep believing and do what you do
I can't help you but I know things are gonna get better
And please stop asking what it's got to do with you
Oh, keep believing cos you know that you deserve better
Who's this man you're talking to, can't you see what he wants to do
He thinks if he stands near enough then he will look as good as you
Oh, he don't care about your problems, he just wants to show his friends
I guess I'm just the same as him, I just didn't know it then
I never understood you really and I know it's too late now
You didn't ask to be that way, oh, I'm sorry Sylvia

So keep believing and do what you do
I can't help you but I know things are gonna get better
And please stop asking what it's got to do with you
Oh, keep believing cos you know that you deserve better
Oh, it's true yeah

So please stop asking what it's got to do with you
Oh, keep believing cos you know that you deserve better
Yeah you know that you deserve better
Oh you know that you deserve better
Oh Sylvia
