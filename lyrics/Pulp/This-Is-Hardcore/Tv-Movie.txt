Without you my life has become a hangover without end
A movie made for tv:
Bad dialogue, bad acting, no interest
Too long with no story and no s**

Is it a kind of weakness to miss someone so much?
To wish the day would go away, like you did yesterday
Just like you did yesterday

And I can't think of a way to get through this pain
To be happy again to make it all alright
And I know it must be bad
Cos sitting here right now all I know is I can't even think
I can't even think of anything clever to say, to say
So I say: "Why pretend any longer?
Cos I need you here with me
It's obvious that I miss you so much, so please say you're gonna stay
So please say you're gonna stay, so please say you're gonna stay

The night is getting darker now and there's nothing on tv
But I'll sit tight till morning light. Yeah I'll wait until the day
Until the day that you say you're gonna stay
