If you stay out all nite that's alright by me / but if you must kiss those guys you could
At least clean your teeth / I don't mean to put you down / but you've taken everything
That I own / don't tell me you want some more cause I'm closed / who is this laughing boy
Who ladders your tights? / please tell him to cut the noise / cause it's spoiling my nites
/ I just want to get some rest / and he's talking to his ma on the phone / well, if he's
So homesick he can go home / I don't need this anymore / and it's written in the stars I
Must go / and will I come back for more? / I don't know / I don't know.
