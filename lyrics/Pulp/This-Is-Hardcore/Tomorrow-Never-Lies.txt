Tomorrow never lies so live for today / don't be afraid of the skeletons of yesterday /
Each morning brings you closer to your goal so grab your chance don't let it go / the city
Streets are littered with the casualties / the could'ves and the should'ves and the
Would've beens / don't let this chance slip by / because tomorrow never lies / tomorrow
Never lies if you live tomorrow today / there are those who would shoot you down / ah /
There's always someone wants to shoot you down / but you know they're never gonna be able
To shoot you down / if you live tomorrow today / if you live tomorrow today / the night
Time blazes with all your nightmares come to life / but you can face the danger knowing
That your cause is right and leave them all below you / bleeding as you rise into the
Night / because you know tomorrow never lies / no, tomorrow never lies / no, it's never,
Never gonna lie if you leve tomorrow today / there are those who would shoot you down / ah
/ there's always someone who wants to shoot you down / but they're never ever gonna be
Able to shoot you down / if you live tomorrow today / yeah if you leve tomorrow today /
Cos you, you gotta live tomorrow today / live it because tomorrow never lies / tomorrow
Never lies / oh no.
