Come and play the tunes of glory
Raise your voice in celebration of the days that we have wasted in the cafe
In the station
And learn the meaning of existence in fortnightly enstalments
Come share this golden age with me in my single room apartment
And if it all amounts to nothing
It doesn't matter, these are still our glory days

Oh my face is unappealing and my thoughts are unoriginal
I did experiments with substances but all it did was make me I'll and
I used to do the I Ching but then I had to feed the meter
Now I can't see into the future but at least I can use the heater
Oh it doesn't get much better than this cos this is how we live our glory days, days
And I could be a genius if I just put my mind to it and I
I could do anything if only I could get round to it
Oh we were brought upon the Space-Race, now they expect you to clean toilets
When you have seen how big the world is, how can you make do with this
If you want me I'll be sleeping in, sleeping in thoughout these glory days

These glory days can take their toll, so catch me now before I turn to gold
Yeah we'd love to hear your story just as long as it tells us where we are
That where we are is where we're meant to be
Oh come on make it up yourself, you don't need anybody else and I promise I won't sell
These days to anybody else in the world but you
No-one but you, no-one but you, no-one but you
