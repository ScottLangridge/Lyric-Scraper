I used to try very hard to make friends with everyone on the planet
I've seen you havin' it, havin' it yeah, but now you've just had it
Entertainment can sometimes be hard when the thing
That you love is the same thing that's holding you down

This man is dangerous, he just she'd his load on your best party frock
Before you enter the palace of wisdom you have to decide:
Are you ready to rock?
Oh, can you party with me?
Can you show me a good time?
Do you even know what one looks like?
And I don't need to hear your stories again
Just get on the floor and show me what you're made of
Just what exactly are you made of?

Baby, you're driving me crazy
Baby, you're driving me crazy

I was having a whale of a time until your uncle Psychosis arrived
Why do we have to half-kill ourselves just to prove we're alive?
I'm here whenever you need me and whenever you need me I won't be here
And have you ever stopped to ask yourself?
If you didn't come to party then why did you come here?
Why did you come here?

Baby, you're driving me crazy
Baby, you're driving me crazy

And do you really want to know just how come you turned out so dumb?
When the party is over will you come home with me?
When the party is over will you come home with me?
Now the party is over will you come home to me
Will you come home to me?
Will you come home to me?
