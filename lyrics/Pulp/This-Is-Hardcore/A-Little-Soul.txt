Hey man, how come you treat your woman so bad?
That's not the way you do it, no no no
You shouldn't do it like that
I could show you how to do it right
I used to practice every night on my wife, now she's gone
Yeah, she's gone

You see your mother and me, we never got along that well you see
I'd love to help you but everybody's telling me you look like me
But please don't turn out like me
You look like me but you're not like me I know
I had one, two, three, four shots of happiness
I look like a big man but I've only got a little soul
I only got a little soul

Yeah, I wish I could be an example
Wish I could say I stood up for you and fought for what I thought was right
But I never did, I just wore my trenchcoat and stayed out every single night
You think I'm joking? Well, try me, yeah, try me. yeah come on, try me tonight
I did what was wrong though I knew what was right
I've got no wisdom that I want to pass on
Just don't hang 'round here, no, I'm telling you son
You don't wanna know me, oh that's just what everybody's telling me

And everybody's telling me you look like me, but please don't turn into me
You look like me but you're not like me I hope
I have run away from the one thing that I ever made
Now I only wish that I could show you -- wish that I could show you a little soul
Wish I could show a little soul
Wish I could show a little soul
Wish I could show a little soul
