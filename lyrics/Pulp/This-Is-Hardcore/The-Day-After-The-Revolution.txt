The dust has settled, replaced the bulbs in all the lights
I guess I'll get no sleep tonight
A revolution happened, oh sorry you haven't heard
We are the children of the new world
If you're quiet you can watch if you like
They say the future's beginning tonight
Whole empires will crumble, civilisations will fall
Lie on the bed, hear the sound of it all
No anger, no guilt and no sorrow
It sounds unlikely, I know but tomorrow you will wake up
To find that your whole life has changed
Although I know, but tomorrow you will wake up to find that you whole life has changed
Although nothing looks different a revolution took place

I love the way you do it, I love the way you put them on
You know the answers but you get it wrong, just to confuse things
Why did it seem so difficult to realise a simple truth?
The revolution begins and ends with you

Now all the breakdowns and nightmares look small
Now we decide not to die after all
Because the meek shall inherit absolutely nothing at all
If you stopped being so feeble you could have so much more
The answer was here all the time you see
Just how I missed it, is a mystery to me
I have waited and waited for this day to arrive
The revolution was televised, now it's over bye bye
It's over bye bye, it's over bye bye

Yeah, we made it
Just by the skin of our teeth Perfection is over, the Rave is over
Sheffield is over, The Fear is over, Guilt is over, please leave the building quietly
Bergerac is over, the hangover is over, Men are over, Women are over
Cholsesterol is over, Tapers are over, Irony is over
Bye bye bye bye
