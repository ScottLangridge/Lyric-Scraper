This is our "music from a Bachelor's Den"
The sound of loneliness turned up to ten
A horror soundtrack from a stagnant water-bed
And it sounds just like this

This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Makin' out that they're okay when they're not
You're gonna like it, but not a lot and the chorus goes like this:

Oh Baby, here comes the fear again
The end is near again
A monkey's built a house on your back
You can't get anyone to come in the sack and
Here comes another panic attack
Oh, here we go again

So now you know the words to our song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad, when you're lonely
And it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear
And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off

When you can't even define what it is
That you are frightened of
This song will be here

Oh Baby, here comes the fear again
The end is near again
If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
But you know you're only having a laugh
Oh, here we go again
Until the end, until the end
