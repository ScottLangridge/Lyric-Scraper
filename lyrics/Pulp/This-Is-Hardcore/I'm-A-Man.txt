Laid here with the advertising sliding past my eyes
Like cartoons from other people's lives
I start to wonder what it takes to be a man
Well I learned to drink and I learned to smoke and I learned to tell a dirty joke
If that's all there is then there's no point for me

So please can I ask just why we're alive?
Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man
Tell me bout it, you can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a man

So you stumble into town and hold your stomach in
Show them what you've got though they've seen everything
Yeah you're a beauty but they've seen your type before
You've got no need but still you want, so go and book that restaurant
The wine will flow and then you'll just fly away

So please can I ask just why, we're alive?
Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man
Tell me bout it, you can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a man

So please can I ask just why, we're alive?
Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man
Tell me bout it, you can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a man
To a man, to a man, to a man
That's what I am
