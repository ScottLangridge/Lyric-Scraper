We like driving on a saturday night, past the Leisure Centre, left at the
Lights.  We don't look for trouble but if it comes we don't run.  Looking
Out for trouble is what we call fun.  Hey you, you in the Jesus sandals,
Wouldn't you like to come over and watch some vandals smashing up someone's
Home?  We can't help it, we're so thick, we can't think, can't think of
Anything but shit, sleep and drink.  Oh, and we like the women; "up the
Women" we say and if we get lucky we might even meet some one day.  Hey
You, you in the Jesus sandals... Etc.  Mister, we just want your car cause
We're taking a girl to the reservoir.  Oh, all the papers say it's a tragedy
But don't you want to come and see?  Mister we want your car... Etc. (x3)
