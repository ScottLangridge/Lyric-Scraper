I fell asleep on your sofa and had a dream about a small child in dungeons
Who caughthis hands in the doors of the Paris metro.  Then my face cracked
Open and you were there, you were there dressed in green, saying something
Obcene.  But that's why I came here in the first place, Oh well that and
The tea.  Can I stay herelying under the table together with you now?  Can
I hold you?  Forever in acrylic afternoons I want to hold you tight whilst
Childern play outside and wait for their mothersto finish with lovers and
Call them inside for their tea.  Cushions and TV and the table set for tea.
One for you, one for me.  Come an dlie down on the settee in that green
Jumper, you can have anything you want and the clock is saying it's half
Past four but you know I want to stay a little more.  Can I stay herelying
Under the table...etc.  On a pink quilted eiderdown, I want to pull your
Knickers down.  Net curtains blow slightly in the breeze.  Lemonade light
Filtering thru the trees.  It's so soft and warm.  Just another cup of tea
Please (just one lump thanks).  Can I stay here lying under the
Table...etc.  Oh, Kevin, Shane, Julie, Diane, Wayne, Frank, Heather,
Rachel, Chelsea, Leanne, come homw.  It's time for your tea.
