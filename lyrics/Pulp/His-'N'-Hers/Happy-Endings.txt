Well, imagine it's a film & you're the star & pretty soon we're coming to
The part where you realize that you should give your heart, Oh give your
Heart to me.  Now the orchestra begins to make a sound that goes round &
Round & round & round & round & round & round & round & round & again & we
Kiss to voilins.  Well some sad people might believe in that I guess but we
Know better don't we?  We know all about the mess.  The aftermath of our
Affair is lying all around and I can't clear it away.  No, And d'you think
That it's so easy to find?  Somebody who is just your kind?  Well it might
Take you a little time but I'm going to have to try.  Oh yeah I'm gonna
Try. And I know no-one can ever know which way to head but don't you
Remember that you once said that you liked happy endings?  And no-one can
Ever know if it's going to work but if you try then you might get your
Happy ending.
