You say you've got to go home cause he's sitting on his own again this
Evening.  I know you're gonna let him bore your pants off again.  Oh God,
It's half past eight you'll be late.  You say you've never been sure tho'
It makes good sense for you to be together.  Still you bought a toy that
Can reach the places he never goes & now it's getting late.  He's so
Straight.  Do you remember the first time? I can't remember a worse time
But you know that we've changed so much since then, oh yeah, we've grown.
Now I don't care what you're doing, no don't care if you screw him just as
Long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah now, you say you've got to go
Home.  Well at least there's someone there that you can talk to and you
Never have to face up to the nite on your own.  Jesus, it must be great to
Be straight.  Do you remember the first time?.. Etc.
