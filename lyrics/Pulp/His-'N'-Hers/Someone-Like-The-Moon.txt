She likes to watch the moon as it travels through the sky cause she's heard
That it's romantic, though she really can't see why.  Someone should have
Helped her through the day.  Someone like the moon.  So she drinks a coffee
& telephones a friend & she asks if she can make it so this night will
Never end.  Someone should have helped her through the day... Etc.  But the
Light comes and the day bleeds through the sky & the sun, the sun makes it
Hard to get through & the radio only plays love songs so she cries, though
She knows it's such a bad thing to do.  In the evening it gets better & she
Thinks how it's not right that someone so stupid can so easily screw up
Your life.  Someone should have helped her through the day.. Etc.  But the
Light comes and the day bleeds through the sky & the sun, the sun makes it
Hard to get through & the radio only plays love songs so she cries, though
She knows it's such a bad thing to do.  Can't you see? Can't you see?
Someone should have helped her through the day.  Someone like the moon.
