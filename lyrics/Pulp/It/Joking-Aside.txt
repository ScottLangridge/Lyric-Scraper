I hate to complain, you know, but then again / I cannot pretend nothing's wrong / looking
At my present situation, the act cannot last for long / viewed from outside these pursuits
I might try / seem possessed of a certain allure / now they're no longer a source of
Mystery my faith in them's more unsure / now the time to play is over / time to dispose of
The lies / time to show what's really / on my mind / yes I'd like to turn you over / to
See what's on your other side / to see if the problem's / in my mind / in my mind / the
Choice is quite clear, to move on or stay here / decision is harder to take / reject what
I have for something unstable could easily be a mistake / so I walk round the place with a
Smile on my face / pretending the best that I can / hoping to lose the inclination to
Desire what I can't understand / and the time to play is over / time to dispose of the
Lies / time to show what's really / on my mind / yes I'd like to turn you over / to see
What's on your other side / to see if the problem's / in my mind / in my mind / lalalalala
Lalalalala... / now the time to play is over / time to dispose of the lies / time to show
What's really / on my mind / yes I'd like to turn you over / to see what's on your other
Side / like to turn it over / in my mind / in my mind / in my mind / in my mind / in my
Mind.
