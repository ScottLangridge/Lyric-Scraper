When I was with this girl last night / she held me tight; it turned me on / the moon was
Dark and those clothes were tight / her perfume strong; it turned me on / fleeting moments
Touched in the night / then so strong but banished by the light / her presence gone,
Memories remain / of how she kissed and turned me on / now there's this love inside of me
/ I've got this love / inside of me / and I still have dull aching pain / desire to reach
And touch you once again / distractions cannot sate the need / it grows once more, it
Grows once more / I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me /
I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside of me / I have this pain
Inside of me / why can't you see? why can't you see? / I'm stranded here with no way home
/ please rescue me, oh won't you rescue me? / I've got this love inside of me / I've got
This love / inside of me / I've got this love inside of me / I've got this love / inside
Of me.
