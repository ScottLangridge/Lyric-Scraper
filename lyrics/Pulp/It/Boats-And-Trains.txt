Would you like to hear
About the things I fear?
About my life, and loves too?
Well why should I tell you?
If I told you a secret
You'd be sure to leak it
You couldn't keep it inside
No matter how hard you tried
On boats and trains and
And boats and trains and
Funny things and
Funny things and
La la la...
