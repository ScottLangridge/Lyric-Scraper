I thought so long and suddenly I realised / I love love / I thought so long and suddenly i
Realised / I love love / am I loving the girl / or the feeling I feel? / is it just the
Idea that I like / or is it for real? / I recall a special friend, I invited her home for
Tea / and while my mother cooked a meal she was under the table with me / I thought so
Long and suddenly I realised / I love love / I thought so long and suddenly I realised / i
Love love / these ideas that I have / remain fixed in my head / only the characters change
/ it's someone else there instead / one day we went down to the park to feed the ducks
Some bread / foul fowls wouldn't touch a scrap so we jumped in the duckpond instead / i
Thought so long and suddenly I realised / I love love / I thought so long and suddenly i
Realised / I love love / lalalalala...
