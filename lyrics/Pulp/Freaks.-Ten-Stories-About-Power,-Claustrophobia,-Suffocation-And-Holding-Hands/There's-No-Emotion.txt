As I lay
Down in the bedroom,
There came a sound
From far away.
As I strained
My ears to listen
I could hear
A thin voice say:

"in your heart
There's no emotion,
And your soul,
Your soul just dried away.
There's no love,
No love left in your body;
Standing empty forever,
And colder
Every day."

So I spent
A night without you,
Oh yes, I spent
A night outdoors.
Staring in
To unknown faces,
Trying to feel
Just like before.

In your heart
There's no emotion,
And your soul,
Your soul just dried away.
There's no love,
No love left in your body;
Standing empty forever,
And colder every day.

Oh yeah.
No I don't
Believe in voices,
Because I hear
Them all the time,
Scraping tears
From hardened faces
With their stupid ugly rhymes.

In your heart
There's no emotion,
And your soul,
Your soul just dried away.
There's no love,
No love left in your body;
Standing empty forever,
And colder every day.
Standing empty forever,
And colder every day.

And this is where the story starts,
Holding hands
That hold you forever,
Only love
Will keep you together.
Holding hands
That hold you forever,
Holding hands
That throw you forever
Away,
Away,
Oh.
