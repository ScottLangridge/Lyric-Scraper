There's not much time for talking,
All your friends are
Going to walk away.
If there was time for talking
All too soon you'd be
Lost for things to say.
Don't you know she could break you,
Every bone that's inside of you?
Then again she might make you
Everything that you want her to,
And if you could walk away,
Where would you go
Anyway?
And if you've still got the chance,
I know you know you'll stay,
Stay.
I don't need your excuses;
Are you tired of
Trying to stay on top?
So just lie back and enjoy it
And save your tears for
When the kissing stops
Oh, you know it's got to stop.
Don't you know she could break you,
Every bone that's inside of you?
Then again she might make you
Everything that you want her to,
And if you could walk away,
Where would you go
Anyway?
And if you've still got the chance,
I know you know you'll stay,
Stay.
Oh, you'll stay,
Oh, you'll stay.
Don't you know she could break you,
Every bone that's inside of you?
Then again she might make you
Everything that you want her to,
And if you could walk away,
Where would you go
Anyway?
And if you've still got the chance,
I know you know you'll stay,
Stay.
Oh, you'll stay,
Oh, you'll stay.
Oh, you'll stay,
Oh, you'll stay,
Oh, you'll stay,
Oh, you'll stay,
Oh, you'll stay.
