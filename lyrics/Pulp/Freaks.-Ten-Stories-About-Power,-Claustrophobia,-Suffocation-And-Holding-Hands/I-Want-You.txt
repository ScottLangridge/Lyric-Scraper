Hey, / you can look, you can look just like anyone else / if that's what you want to do. /
I, / I could laugh, I could laugh in your face if I want / oh, but I'm not going to. /
([backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba) / when we met last week on saturday, / ([backing vocals:]
Ba ba ba ba) / I couldn't make a sentence, / I couldn't even say / what I meant to say: /
That I want you / (it doesn't hurt to say I want you), I need you / (I never thought I'd
Say I need you), I'll keep you, / oh yes I'll keep you and I'll throw myself away, away,
Away, / and I'll break you / because I lose myself inside you, I'll make you / fit in the
Space that I provide you, I'll take you, / oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far
Away, away, away. / yes, / yes, you're all, yes you're all that I ever desire, / still
I'll kill you in the end. / when, / when it seems, when it seems that it's getting too
Soft, / when you lapse into a friend, / ([backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba) / there's someone
Just behind the door / ([backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba) / so don't betray your feelings, /
No don't talk anymore, / never dare to say / that I want you / (it doesn't hurt to say I
Want you), I need you / (I never thought I'd say I need you), I'll keep you, / oh yes i'll
Keep you and I'll throw myself away, away, away, / and I'll break you / because I lose
Myself inside you, I'll make you / fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you, /
Oh yes, I'll take you just to push you far away, away, away. / now, / now we come, now we
Come to the end of it all, / see it squirming, almost dead. / no, / you can't leave, you
Can't leave it to die here in pain. / you've got to stamp upon it's head. / ([backing
Vocals:] ba ba ba ba) / I'll go out and you'll stay home / ([backing vocals:] ba ba ba ba)
/ facing up to living, / living on your own, / and I'll curse my pride, / curse my pride,
/ curse my stupid pride / because I want you / (it doesn't hurt to say I want you), I need
You / (I never thought I'd say I need you), I'll keep you, / oh yes I'll keep you and i'll
Throw myself away, away, away, / and I'll break you / because I lose myself inside you,
I'll make you / fit in the space that I provide you, I'll take you, / oh yes, I'll take
You just to push you far away, away, away.
