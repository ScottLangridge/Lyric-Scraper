"There's a light that shines on everything & everyone.
And it shines so bright - brighter even than the sun".
That's what Minnie thinks as she walks to meet her brother,
Who is nearly two years older, on a Saturday night.
He's DJ-ing at some do on the edge of town on the night
That Minnie Timperley died.

It's such a beautiful world, you're such a beautiful girl.
So much that you want to try, the world wants to sleep with you tonight.
But Minnie, Minnie if I could I would give you the rest of my life.

How can a girl have sex with these pathetic teenage wrecks?
Football scarves, the girls drink halves & her brother's crying 'cause he has lost his decks.
Outside the air was cool, an older guy sitting in his car asked if Minnie needed a ride.
He thought he was still dangerous - paunchy, but dangerous -
On the night that Minnie Timperley died.

It's such a beautiful world, you're such a beautiful girl.
And he only did what he did 'cause you looked like one of his kids.
But Minnie, Minnie if I could I would give you the rest of my life.

Minnie. Oh, Minnie I can feel the pain. Oh yeah
