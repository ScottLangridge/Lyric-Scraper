When you raise your pencil skirt,
Like a veil before my eyes,
Like the look upon his face as he's zipping up his flies.
Oh I know that you're engaged to him.
Oh but I know that you want something to play with baby.

I'll be around when he's not in town,
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong,
I really love it when you tell me to stop.
Oh it's turning me on.

You can tell me some lies,
About the good times that you've had,
But I've kissed your more than twice,
And now I'm working on your Dad.
Oh baby.

I'll be around when he's not in town,
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong,
I really love it when you tell me to stop.
Oh it's turning me on.

If you look under the bed,
Then I can see my house from here,
So just lie against the wall,
And watch my conscience disappear now baby

I'll be around when he's not in town,
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong,
I really love it when you tell me to stop.
Oh it's turning me on.

I only come here cause I know it makes you sad.
I only do it cause I know you know it's bad.
Oh yes I know,
That it's ugly and it shouldn't be like that.
Oh but oh it's turning me on.
