Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits.
Raised on a diet of broken biscuits, oh
We don't look the same as you,
We don't do the things you do,
But we live around here too, Oh really.

Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits,
We'd like to go to town but we can't risk it, oh
'cause they just want to keep us out.
You could end up with a smack in the mouth
Just for standing out, Oh really.

Brothers, sisters, can't you see?
The future's owned by you and me.
There won't be fighting in the street.
They think they've got us beat, but revenge is going to be so sweet.
We're making a move,
We're making it now,
We're coming out of the side-lines.
Just put your hands up, it's a raid yeah.
We want your homes,
We want your lives,
We want the things you won't allow us.
We won't use guns,
We won't use bombs,
We'll use the one thing we've got more of, that's our minds.

Check your lucky numbers,
That much money could drag you under, oh.
What's the point of being rich,
If you can't think what to do with it?
'cause you're so bleeding thick.
Oh we weren't supposed to be,
We learnt too much at school now we
Can't help but see,
That the future that you've got mapped out is
Nothing much to shout about.

We're making a move,
We're making it now,
We're coming out of the side-lines.
Just put your hands up, it's a raid yeah.
We want your homes,
We want your lives,
We want the things you won't allow us.
We won't use guns,
We won't use bombs,
We'll use the one thing we've got more of, that's our minds
