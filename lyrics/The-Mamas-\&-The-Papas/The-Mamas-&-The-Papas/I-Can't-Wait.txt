I can't wait to say good-bye;
I can't wait to make you cry.
I can wait... I can wait to let you down.

I can wait... Can wait to hear you say
That you love me and youl change your ways,
But Il say... But Il say I rather be free;
It gonna be so good for me
And baby I can wait---
Baby, I can wait (no).

I can wait to hear you plead;
I can wait---it what I need.
I can wait (I can) to see you fall
(Can wait to see you fall...)
I can wait (can wait) to hear you scream,
Baby, when you know that it the end of your dreams.
Can wait to see your face when I packed up and leaving your place---
And baby I can wait (no).

I can wait to say good-bye;
I can wait to make you cry.
I can wait... I can wait to let you dow
(Can wait to let you down...)
I can wait... Can wait to hear you say that you love me and youl change your ways
But Il say... But Il say I rather be free
It gonnn be so food for me
And, baby, I can wait, no
