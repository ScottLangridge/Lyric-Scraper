(John Phillips)
Did you ever want to cry,
But you didn know just why?
Did you ever sit up all night long
Just listening to that same old song---
The one they played when she said nothin? Could go wrong?
Right, I know you did; oh, you kid---
Did you really think that she be true?
Wasn that rather naive of you?
And now she dropped you like a worn-out shoe.

She got you drinking gin,
And you know that a sin.
You go honky-tonkin' every night;
You get drunk and then you start a fight.
I know that you think that it alright---
Wrong, it not the way to live; you only get what you give!
You can live your life just as you please,
But, when you lie with dogs, you gotta get fleas.
And now she brought you down to your knees.
Arms that used to hold you tight---
You miss them in the middle of night.
You burned a candle at both ends;
Now it too late... Too late to make amends.
Youe even lost your old time friends...

Enemies glad to see you down;
People, they don want you hangin? Round.
Did you ever want to cry,
But you didn know just why?
Right, I know you did.
Wrong, it not the way to live.
Did you ever want to cry...
