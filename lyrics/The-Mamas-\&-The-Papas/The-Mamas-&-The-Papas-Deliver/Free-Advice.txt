(John Phillips and Michelle Gilliam)
A bit of free advice (vice)---
Wel tell it to you now (nice, twice).
If youe got some habits
Some people won allow (won allow, allow)...
Be cool; be clean
If you know what I mean.

Wee all got our ups (ups, ups) ;
Wee all got our downs (wee all got our downs).
Some of us are careless
And leave m layin?around (layin?round, around)
Be neat, discreet,
And keep your ear to the ground.
Everyone has had a loved one who far, far away.
And if you don want to take that trip someday...
(Think twice)
Be cool (be cool);
Be clean (be clean)
If you know what I mean.

Everyone has had a loved one who far far away;
And if you don wanna take that trip someday---
A bit of free advice (vice, vice)
Wel tell it to you now (tell it to you now)
If youe got some habits
Some people won allow (won allow, allow)...
Everyone has had a loved one...
Don be out on the street...
Everyone has had a loved one...
If you know what I mean...
