Got a feelin? That I wasting time on you babe;
Got a feelin? That youe been untrue.
I got a feelin? That youe stealin?
All the love I thought I was giving to you.
Baby, it true.

Got a feelin? That youe playing some game with me babe;
Got a feelin? That you just can see.
If youe entertaining any thought that youe gaining
By causing me all of this pain and making me blue
The joke on you.

When I get to feeling that youe stealing love
And I don know why, baby,
It makes me so discouraged
I finally get the courage not to cry, babe,
Or even try, babe.

Got a feelin? That youe been untrue.
I got a feelin? That youe stealin?
All the love I thought I was giving to you.
Baby, it true; the joke on you.
Baby it true; the joke on you.
