She wants to be onstage, front page.
Il sign the dotted line;
You know, I gonna shine.
She just needs that big break, that great take
To start my new career;
Youl see that I sincere
And I won blow it.

Uh, Mister Director? Please...
Don reject her il youe heard her read
For the lead in your new production.
Mister Producer? Please...
Don seduce her il youe heard her sing
And everything in your new production.

She got to be hot stuff, real tough.
I wanna be photographed,
Asked for my autograph.
I don want to keep house for a spouse.
I much rather be the girl;
I need much more to be the pearl
Of the movies.
I much rather be the girl;
I need much more to be the pearl
Of the movies.
I much rather be the girl,
Need much more to be the pearl
Of the movies.
