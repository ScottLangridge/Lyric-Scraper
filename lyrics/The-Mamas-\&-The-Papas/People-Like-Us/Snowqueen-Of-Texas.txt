Snowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke.
They say that she may be beaten,
But I know that she not broke.
She living in a cool green farmhouse;
If you go to Houston,
Be quiet as a mouse.

Met a man in [?]
Having her name tattooed on his arm.
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
Boots of Spanish leather, I never meant you any harm.
I on my knees, your majesty;
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss of me.
I on my knees your majesty.
Snowqueen of Texas
Left Paris in a cloud of smoke.
They say that she may be beaten,
But I know that she not broke.
She living in a cool green farmhouse;
If you go to Houston,
Be quiet as a mouse.

She mending a fairy tale---
Reading her heart.
(Ooh, a Deborah forever)
That a good motto
For some jokeman card.
I on my knees, your majesty;
Snowqueen, save a cold kiss of me.
(I on my knees your majesty)
I on my knees your majesty.
(I on my knees your majesty.)
I on my knees your majesty.
(I on my knees your majesty.)
Snowqueen...
Save a cold kiss for me.
