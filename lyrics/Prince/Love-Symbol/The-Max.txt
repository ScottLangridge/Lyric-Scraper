Where are you?
You can relax now, the Max is in control
Go... Yeah yeah

When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
When half a chance is all I get if I get a chance at all
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
The max - We can dance if you want 2, but I might break yo back
The max - More funk for your buck you can bet on that

When they tell me 2 walk a straight line
I put on crooked shoes
When they tell me that I can't live forever
I pay some overdues (Kick it)
When they start makin' up a crazy rule
That's when I break a back
Cuz when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby (oh yeah), tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack (oh, yeah yeah)
The max - We can dance if you want 2 (ooh yeah), but I might break yo back
(2 the max)
The max - More funk for your buck you can bet on that

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Oh, yeah yeah!

(Dig it) When my body starts to shiver from the chill of
The scarlet sweat
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon
Reflecting from the wet
When the blood of my love outraces
Every one of the stallions in your pack - that's when
You go, you go, you go 2 the max. You go

The max (2 the max)
The max (oooh, get funky)
The max (get-get-get funky) (2 the max)
The max (get funky)

Let' go
I think I'm gonna like this

Let's go (dance)
I wanna dance
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go (Oh yeah yeah!)

I go 2 the max
I'm not afraid (oh my god)
I wanna dance

Then listen -
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe - that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max - Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max - Yo baby, I wanna shuffle the cards in that stack
The max - We can dance if you want 2, but I might break yo back
The max - More funk for your buck you can bet on that

This is the max

Dear love, dear love, dear love
Forgive me 4 my sins
But you left me in such a cold cold world to suffer in (kick it)
And Contrary 2 popular belief
Even though one's life is brief
If you go there once you
Come again and again and
Let's go

[I'm so sorry for you...]

This is the max
