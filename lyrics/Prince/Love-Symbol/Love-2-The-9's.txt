You say that you love me like river
A river you say'll never run dry
I'd rather hear you say 4 ever
Instead of a smile I'd rather see you cry
Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless you love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's
Baby, (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time (4 all time)

Baby, take a real good look at my face
Cuz honey, it just might be the last time
Maybe you should have played an ace
Instead you played the queen
U'd be better off cheatin' than tryin'
2 read my mind

Don't use the magical
Mysterious, intoxicating, joy fantastic
Fascinating word called love
Unless you love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes over your
Body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's
Baby, (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved, sugar (2 the 9's)
I wanna be loved 4 all time (4 all time)

Love me 2 the (9's)

Stay awake 4 4teen hours
Listen 2 the band play New Power Soul
We got 2 get with this
Dancing 2 the beat 'til we lose our mind control

Can I get a witness?
I'm lookin' 4 a lover with a body that says some mo'
I want 2 see the booty boom before I even let
Her get close enough 2 smell perfume
I'm lookin' 4 a Phd
Ass piled high and deep you see
I can't help it - like a honey 2 a bee -
If the booty boom she gonna go with me
And then T. Will whip out a 37 questionnaire and
Machine gun a sister like he just don't care
Machine gun a sister like he just got 2
Just got 2, just got 2 - hit it

How many kids you got - "Egads, I'm shocked!"
How many books you read - "Is Hemmingway dead?"
Well who's the President now - "Does it matter? Wow"
Then how you gonna make that booty boom?
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom?"

Yo, check this out
Would you hug me on a crowded street?
Could you keep your cool if I washed your feet?
You soul a bath
What if I gave it, your body I ask
How long would you save it?
Could you lie down on a bed of thorns
While I drink your ocean dry?
And if we said we loved each other
Instead of smilin', would you cry?
Could you kiss 3 times with your dress upside
Downstroked and laughin'
Would you stay awake 4 4teen hours
Listenin' 2 the grass grow?
I ask thee would you, could you,
Would you love me 2 the 9's (I'll love you 2 the 9's)
Would you, could you,
Will you love me for all time? (I'll love you 4 all time)
Would you, could you,
Will you love me 2 the 9's (I'll love you 2 the 9's)

(love 2 the 9's)
(love 4 all time)
Wanna be loved, sugar (love 2 the 9's)
Wann be loved 4 all time (love 4 all time)

Love me 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)

I wanna be loved 2 the 9's (2 the 9's)
4 all time

2 the 9's, 2 the 9's, 2 the 9's
2 the 9's, 2 the 9's, 2 the 9's
