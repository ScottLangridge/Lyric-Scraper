I had everything I needed,
But now my life is so blue
You meant the world to me,
But now you're gone and I'm so blue
And even though the sun is shining,
I spend my day, I spend my day crying over you
I spend my day crying over you

I, oh I feel just like the sky
I'm so blue

Oh baby, don'cha know... Baby don'cha know
I spend my nights all alone
Talking to myself
I am so blue

And everyday the feelin' gets stronger
And who's to say just how much longer
I can spend my nights all alone
Talkin' to myself and just-a cryin' over you
I guess I'll just spend my life so...
So blue
