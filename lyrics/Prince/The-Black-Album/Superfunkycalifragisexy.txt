If your body needs water
Keep on dancing cuz you oughta
Keep the blood flowing down 2 your feet
Brother Lois should be around in a minute
With a bucket filled with squirreled meat

The blood is real good if you drink it real fast
But the aftertaste just lasts and lasts
If you kiss somebody, you wanna party all night
All right!

If you do 2 much, your skin will be sensitive 2 touch
The first person that touches you, you want 2 fuck
You take them 2 your crib and you tie them 2 a chair
Then you make funny faces til they get really scared
Then you turn on the neon, then you play with yourself
Til you turn them on

This chair goes round and round, I feel like a clown
Cuz I'm stripped down, It's all fun and games
Til the very next day, til, damn, you don't remember my name
Maybe I'll see you next Thursday night, maybe I won't

That says, I was the best you ever had
