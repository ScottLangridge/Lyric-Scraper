Serve it up, Frankie

This is precisely what I intend 2 do, honey

Honey, do you know I let Robert cut my hair this morning?
(Honey, look at this one here) (I'm lookin' Joe tryin' 2 see)

Oh girl, where'd you get those shoes?

You know he had me lookin' so bad (Honey, she's so free)
I'm so tired

These are "come-and-fuck-me" pumps (Who, Robert?)

Maurice thinks: (Mm, I think that's right, honey)

Go on up 2 her, say something

Maurice, what, what can I serve you? (Umean he's male?)

Baby, I swear 2 God if you don't kiss 'em
I'm gonna kick your super natural ass!

Frankie, play something, bitch!
(Squirrel Meat!)

Uh! Don't try it!

Cat, what's happenin' babe? (bitch, would you play something?)

Get outta my face! (Honey, it's not that type of party)
(Talk 2 me, talk 2 me - do you remember me?)

What cha mean? (Honey, he could teach you the answer 2 life)

Honey, you see these pumps? (bitch!)
(Answer? Honey, you ain't gonna quit)

I wanna, I wanna: (Who you callin' bitch? Ho bitch!)
