Baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be?
Oh baby, baby, baby
Is it him or is it me?

Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me 2night?
Oh Baby, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please you right?

You were so hard 2 find
The beautiful ones, they hurt you every time

Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life
The vision in ones mind
The Beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always everytime

If I told you baby
That I was in love with you
Oh Baby baby baby
If we got married
Would that be cool?

You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You seem always to lose

Baby, baby, baby

What's it gonna be baby?

Do you want him? Or
Do you do want me?
Cuz I want you.

Say I want you
Tell me baby
Do you want me
I gotta know
I gotta know
Do you want me

Can I tell you a story??
Sometimes you lose
Let me tell you
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes you win
Yes you do
I say sometimes
Sometimes
I get so confused
Yes I do
But I say right now
Right now
I know what I want
I want you

Baby, baby, baby
Listen

I may not know where I'm going baby
Look here
I may not knkow what I need
But one thing
One thing for certain baby

I know what I want
And it's to please you baby
Please you baby
I'm begging down on my knees
I want you
Yea
I want you
Baby baby baby baby
I want you
Yes I do
