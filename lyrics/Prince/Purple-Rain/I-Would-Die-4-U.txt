I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand

Ill never beat you
Ill never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by

You - I would die 4 you, yeah
Darling if you want me 2
You - I would die 4 you

I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend

No need 2 worry
No need 2 cry
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why

Cuz you - I would die 4 you, yeah
Darling if you want me 2
You - I would die 4 you

Youre just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad

I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is 2 know that
You believe

Yeah, I would die 4 you, yeah
Darling if you want me 2
You - I would die 4 you

Yeah, say one more time

You - I would die 4 you
Darling if you want me 2
You - I would die 4 you
2 3 4 you

I would die 4 you
I would die 4 you
You - I would die 4 you
You - I would die 4 you
