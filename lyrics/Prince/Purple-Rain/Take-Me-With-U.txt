I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes, what can I say
They turn me on

Chorus:
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with you

Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other oh so much
Why must we play this game?

Don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with you

I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is 2 spend the night 2gether
All I want is 2 spend the night in your arms

2 be around you is so-oh right
U're sheer perfection (Thank U)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection

Chorus {x2}

Just take me with you
Won't you take me with you?
Honey, take me with you
