How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve
There's a rumor goin all round that you aint been gettin served
They say that you aint you know what
In baby who knows how long
Its hard 4 me 2 say what's right
When all I wanna do is wrong

Gett off - 23 positions in a 1 night stand
Gett off - I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off - let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - I you want 2 baby here I am (here I am)

I clocked the jizz from a friend
Of yours named vanessa bet (bet)
She said you told her a fantasy
That got her all wet (wet)
Something about a little box with a
Mirror and a tongue inside
What she told me then got me so hot
I knew that we could slide

Gett off (gett off)

1 2 3 - nah, little cutie, I aint drinkin (gett off)
Scope this, I was just thinkin
You + me, what a ride
If you was thinkin the same
We could continue outside (gett off)
Lay your pretty body against a parkin meter
Strip your dress down
Like I was strippin a peter pauls almond joy
Lemme show you baby I'm a talented boy

Everybody grab a body
Pump it like you want somebody

Gett off (gett off)

So here we-so here we-so here we are, here we are (g-g-gett off)
In my paisley crib
Whatcha want 2 eat? Ribs
Ha, toy, I don't serve ribs...
You better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when you sat down

Honey them hips is gone
That's alright, I clock em that way
Remind me of something james used to say...

I like em fat
I like em proud
Ya gotta have a mother for me

Now move your big ass round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Tonight your a star
And I'm the big dipper

(kick it)
