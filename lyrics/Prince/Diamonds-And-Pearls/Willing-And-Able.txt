Said I'm willin' and I'm able
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table
I've been holdin' back this feelin'
4 far 2 long
Now that I'm willin', it's a fact
Is truly mighty strong
Like a child lost in the wilderness
'Till I reach my destination, I won't rest

Cuz I'm willin' (willin')
And I'm able (able)
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table (table)

There's some kings in my deck and a queen or 2
So you know there ain't nothin',
Nothin' that I wouldn't do (Nothin' that I wouldn't do)
It 'twas a long time coming,
But now that it's here
All the non-believers better fear me

Cuz I'm willin (willin' and able)
And I'm able
I got good and plenty cards
2 place on the table (table)

Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long
(Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long)
Now that I'm willing, (this feelin')
This feelin'
It's truly mighty strong (truly, I... I)

I'm willing (willin')
And able (able)
My vision is all clear, I'm feelin' kinda stable
You know I am, you know I am
Ready 2 whisper (whisper, whatcha say)
Ready 2 shout (shout, now whatcha say)
Ready 2 scream (scream, now whatcha say)
From the highest mountain top (whatcha say, whatcha say)

Lord, I'm willing and able
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing

(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)

(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)

I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
(dance and sing, let me watch you do your thing)
(bring it to me)

Let me take a bite
2 see if u're ripe
I'm kinda thinkin' about
Takin' a hunk, chunk
A piece of your love tonight

Well hello, mc T on a mello
Swing low to the tempo
As I flow on a roll
Here we go, willing and able
Start the show right
With that type of hype
Lay my cards on the table tonite
Don't take me light
My flow hits you just like a lead pipe
While I'm clockin'
You just say 'fess
About the boots I'm knockin'
It ain't like that
[somethin' to keep the Jimmy so get] off my back
In fact you lack the knack
Step back before I show you how a fool acts, baby

Yeah
