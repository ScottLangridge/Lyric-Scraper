I guess I shoulda known
By the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last

See you're the kinda person
That believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say what have I got to lose?
And honey I say

Little red corvette
Baby you're much to fast
Little red corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I shoulda closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free

Cause I felt a little I'll
When I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not
I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah

Little red corvette
Baby you're much to fast, yes you are
Little red corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last

A body like yours (a body like yours)
Oughta be in jail (oughta be in jail)
Cause it's on the verge of bein obscene
(Cause it's on the verge of bein obscene)

Move over baby (move over baby)
Gimme the keys (gimme the keys)
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine
(I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine)

Little red corvette
Baby you're much to fast
Little red corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last

Little red corvette
Honey you got to slow down (got to slow down)
Little red corvette
Cause if you don't you gonna run your
Little red corvette right in the ground

(Little red corvette)
Right down to the ground (honey you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down (little red corvette)
You're movin much to fast (to fast)
You need to find a love that's gonna last

Girl, you got an ass like I never seen
And the ride...
I say the ride is so smooth
You must be a limousine

Baby you're much 2 fast
Little red corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's
That's gonna last
(Little red corvette)
You got 2 slow down (you got 2 slow down)
Little red corvette

Cuz if you don't, cuz if you don't,
You gonna run your body right into the ground (right into the ground)
Right into the ground (right into the ground)
Right into the ground (right into the ground)

Little red corvette
