You can dance if you want 2
All the critics love you in New York
You don't have 2 keep the beat
They'll still think it's neat in New York

You can wear what you want 2
It doesn't matter in New York
You could cut off all your hair
I don't think they'd care in New York

All the critics love you in New York

Why you can play what you want 2
All the critics love you in New York
They won't say that U're naive
If you play what you believe in New York

Purple love-amour is all U're in it 4
But don't show it
The reason that U're cool
Is cuz U're from the old school and they know it

All the critics love you in New York

You can dance if you want 2
All the critics love you in New York
You can dance if you want 2
All the critics love you in New York

All the critics love you, all the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York

It's time 4 new direction, it's time 4 jazz 2 die
4th day of November, we need a purple high

Don't give up
I'll still love you

All the critics love you in New York {x2}
All the critics love you, all the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York

Body don't wanna quit, gotta get another hit {x4}

[(On the 1)]
All the critics love you, all the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York

What're you lookin' at, punk?

Look out all you hippies, you ain't as sharp as me
It ain't about the trippin', but the sexuality
Turn it up!
You can dance if you want 2

All the critics love you in New York {x2}

Yes, we're certain of it
He's definitely masturbating

All the critics love you in New York
Take a bath, hippie!
All the critics love you in New York {x4}
In New York
New York {x4}
