Let's work {x2}

I've had my eyes on you
Ever since you walked in the room
Come on and take my hand
Don't try 2 understand

Oh baby, nothing can stop us now
I'm gonna show you how
Show you how 2 work
Come on, let's have some fun
We'll work till the morning comes
I wanna see you work, come on!

I'd love 2 turn you on
And work you all night long
If I could get you in the raw
Baby, I'd make you climb the walls

Oh yeah, nothing can stop us now
I'm gonna show you how, oh yeah
Show you how 2 work
Come on, let's have some fun
We'll work till the morning comes, baby
