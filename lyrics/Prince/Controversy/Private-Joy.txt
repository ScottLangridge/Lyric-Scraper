U're my little secret, my private joy
I could never let another play with my toy
U're my little angel from heaven above
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, I think I'm falling in love

And I ain't gonna tell nobody nobody 'bout my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love 2 love you but U're my little private joy
My private joy

Private joy - such a pretty toy
Joy - you are my private joy

U're my little lover, orgasmatron
Only I know, only I know, baby, what turns you on
U're my little secret neon light
Girl, I wanna turn it on, turn it on, turn it on every night, ooh

All the other kids would love 2 love you but U're my little private joy
My private joy

Private joy - such a, such a pretty toy
Joy - you are my private joy
