Ow! {x5}

Stand up, everybody, this is your life
Let me take you 2 another world, let me take you 2night
You don't need no money, you don't need no clothes
The second coming, anything goes

Sexuality is all U'll ever need
Sexuality - let your body be free

Ow!
Oh baby

Come on, everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talkin' 'bout a revolution we gotta organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

I'm ok as long as you are here with me
Sexuality is all we ever need

Oh baby!

(The reproduction of the new breed - Leaders, stand up, organize)
{repeat phrase in bg}
Everybody
One time, say...

We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists - 89 flowers on their back
Inventors of the Accu-Jack
They look at life through a pocket camera
What? No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags
Who teach their kids that love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are you listening?
We need a new breed - Leaders, stand up, organize... Yeah!
Don't let your children watch television until they know how 2 read
Or else all they'll know how 2 do is cuss, fight and breed
No child is bad from the beginning
They only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and you. S. History
What's 2 be expected is 3 minus 3, oh
Absolutely nothing

Stand up, organize
(The reproduction of the new breed - Leaders, stand up, organize)
We need the new breed - Leaders, stand up, organize
I wanna be in the new breed - stand up, organize
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality - I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality - I'm gonna let my body be free
Sexuality {repeat 2 fade}
