Annie Christian wanted
2 be number one
But her kingdom never comes
Thy will be done
She couldn't stand the glory
She would be second 2 none
The way Annie tells the story
She's His only Son

Annie Christian wanted
2 be a big star
So she moved 2 Atlanta
And she bought a blue car
She killed black children
And what's fair is fair
If U try and say U're crazy
Everybody say, "Electric chair!" (Electric chair!)

CHORUS:
Annie Christian, Anti-Christ
Until U're crucified
I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Anti-Christ
Until U're crucified
I'll live my life in taxicabs

Annie Christian was a whore
Always lookin' 4 some fun
Being good was such a bore
So she bought a gun
She killed John Lennon
Shot him down cold
She tried 2 kill Reagan
Everybody say, "Gun control!" (Gun control!)

CHORUS

"Liar, liar, liar!"
Gotcha in a jam
Put your head on the block
Somebody say, "ABSCAM!" (ABSCAM!)

CHORUS
