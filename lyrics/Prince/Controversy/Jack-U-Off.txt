If U're looking 4 somewhere 2 go
Girl, I'll take you 2 a movie show
We can sit in the back and I'll jack you off

I can't give you everything you want
But I can take you 2 a restaurant
And if U're not hungry, I'll jack you off

If your man ain't no good
Come on over 2 my neighborhood
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack you off

If U're tired of the masturbator
Little girl, we can go on a date, uh
And if you like, I'll jack you off

Chorus:
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off

I only do it 4 a worthy cause
Virginity or menopause
U'll have an instant heart attack if I jack you off

If you really really wanna be a star
We gotta do it in your mama's car
Naked in a Cadillac, I'll jack you off

If we can't find no place 2 go
Girl, I'll take you 2 a movie show
We can sit in the back and I'll jack you off

Chorus

Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, I'll jack you off
Alright, say it
Get some, want some [head]
I'll jack you off

If you ain't a chicken, baby, come here
If U're good, I'll even let you steer
As a matter of fact, you can jack me off

Yeah (That's right)
I'll jack you off, hey
Yeah!
(Sometimes)
I'll jack you off!

Yeah, yeah, yeah..!
