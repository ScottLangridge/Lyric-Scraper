Orion's arms are wide enough 2 hold us both 2gether
Although we're worlds apart, I'd cross the stars 4 you

In the heart of a sleepless moon, I'll be with you 4ever
This is my destiny till my life is through

Chorus:
The Arms of Orion, that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover in the Sea of Tranquility
Drowning without you here, my dear

When I am lost or feeling lonely, I just look 2 heaven
I find my comfort there
God only knows where you are 2night

God only knows where you are 2night
Maybe time will tell me
Till then I close my eyes, say a prayer 4 you
(Say a prayer 4 you 2)

Chorus:
The Arms of Orion, that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover in the Sea of Tranquility
Drowning without you here, my dear

Orion's heart is bright enough 2 shine on both of us
The constellations never fail 2 light the way 4 love

Orion's arms are wide enough 2 hold us both 2gether
Although we're worlds apart (I'd cross the stars 4 U)
I'd cross the stars 4 you

Chorus:
The Arms of Orion, that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover in the Sea of Tranquility
Drowning without you here, my dear

The Arms of Orion, that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone I've been drowning (Lost)
In the Sea of Tranquility (Lonely)
Drowning without you here (Baby)
My dear (Drowning without you, oh)

Arms of Orion
That's where I wanna be (Where I?)
That's where I wanna be (The Arms of Orion) {x2}
Since U've been gone, babe
Since U've been gone, I've been drowning (Drowning)
Drowning, drowning without your love
The Arms of Orion (Arms of Orion)
