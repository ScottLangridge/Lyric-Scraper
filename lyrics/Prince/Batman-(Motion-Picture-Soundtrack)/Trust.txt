(W, X, Y, Z)
"Hey, it's the man! Yeah, let's see what's going on!"

[chorus:]
Trust - who do ya?
Trust - what makes you a real lover?
Trust - I put this question to ya
Cuz I want you 2 be with me

Love - you cannot imagine
How much I want 2 give 2 you
Hot - I get so excited
Just thinkin' about all we could do
Dig it now

Another world awaits us
Another power 2 see
Close - don't worry about nobody else
From now on U'll be here with me

[Chorus:]

Money - how much'll make you happy?
You can have it all if it'll suit you right
But nothin', I said nothin' can take the place
Of you and me kickin' it tight, tight!
Come, it's easy
Just let yourself go - don't put up a fight
S** - it's not that type of party
Girl, we're gettin' higher 2 night

[Chorus:]

"Get 'em! Take the pictures!"
"Gotham's greed!"

Trust

Hot and close, dig it now
Ooh, that feels good

[Chorus:]

Oh, My Lord!
When I'm on I feel good
Trust (good Lord)
When I'm on I feel good
Trust

Who do ya trust if you can't trust God?
Who can you trust - who can ya?
Who do ya trust if you can't trust God?
Who can you trust - who can ya?

Come and see

[Chorus:]

Wait, I want ya with me
