Pardon me, I wanna talk 2 you
I may be kinda shy but I just gotta tell you what I'm gonna do
Someone over there said he wants 2 get 2 know ya
I... I don't care cuz I really wanna hold ya
But I'm so scared cuz he might do something 2 you that U'd like

I've been waiting such a bloody long time
Just 2 get this close 2 you
Now that U're near me, I want you 2 hear me
And tell you what I wanna do

Oh, I wanna do it, do it all night
I wanna do it, do it 2 you right

Giving up so easy is something that I'd never do
But I'm so easy, so easy when it comes 2 loving you
Can't you understand that I wanna hug and kiss you?
I'll do anything I can just 2 give you happiness
And baby, drown, baby, drown, baby, in your arms
Come on, baby, can't you get 2 this?

I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you been talking 2 someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I wanna mention

I wanna do it, do it all night
I wanna do it, oh, do it 2 you right

Oh yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Do it all night
I... I wanna do it, yeah, do it 2 you right
Do it all night, I wanna do it, oh, do it all night
Gotta do you, baby, do it (oh no, oh yeah), do it 2 you right
I gotta, gotta do it, gotta do it, oh no, do it all night
Do it, gotta do it, gotta do it, oh yeah (oh no), do it 2 you right
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, ...
(Do it all night)
Oh no (Do it, baby, do it, baby, do it all night)
(Do it 2 you right)
Do it 2 you right, gotta do it
