I gotta broken heart again
Cuz my only supposed 2 be friend
You see he, he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be

I gotta broken heart again
Cuz I ain't got no money 2 spend
You see I, I spent it all on a long distance phone call
Beggin' her 2 please come home, yeah

Ah yeah

It doesn't matter what I do
I can't stop, ah, thinkin' about you
The little things you said, the things you do 2 me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you outta my head

Oh, gotta broken heart again, yeah
This time it's serious, it feels just like the end
Cuz once your love has gone away
There ain't nothin', nothin' left 2 say
