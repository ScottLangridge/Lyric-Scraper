I was only 16 but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was 32, lovely and loose
She don't wear no underwear
She said it only gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stoppin' the juice

My sister never made love 2 anyone else but me
She's the reason 4 my, uh, sexuality
She showed me where it's supposed 2 go
A blowjob doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said 2 be

Oh sister - don't put me on the street again
Oh sister - I just wanna be your friend

I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted 2 turn me out
She'd take a whip 2 me until I shout
Oh motherfucker, she's a motherfucker, can't you understand?

Oh sister - don't put me on the street again
Oh sister - I just wanna be your friend

I know what you want me 2 do
Put me on the street and make me blue

Oh sister!
Oh sister!
Oh!
