Stop telling me what you want me 2 hear
Stop telling me what you want me 2 fear
Stop trippin' on something you overheard
Love is winning without a word
Stop giving me Ur "wish list"
Love is free from all this

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... Whatever... You want it 2 b

Love is not a game you can play on the floor
You gotta stop keepin' score
If you wanna, If you want 2 play me like you did b4
You better stop and walk out the door
You can skate around the issue if you like
But who's gonna get you high in the middle of the night?

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... Whatever... You want it 2 b

I c you standing with Ur back on the wall
You better, better get Ur hands up and clap if that's all
And uh, if you don't wanna get Urs, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna b no drama 'cause we have a good time

What's the point of giving me ultimatums?
Smiling at my friends when you really hate 'em
Trying 2 convince me that eye should 2...
What's the point?

Stop worryin' about what people say
When it ain't gonna stop them anyway
Love can do anything if you try
Come on... Spread Ur wings... Let's fly, fly so high

Flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... Whatever... Whatever...

Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abudance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever... Whatever... You want it 2 b

Whatever you want it 2 B
Alright
Let's skate

I c you standing with Ur back on the wall
Better get Ur hands up and clap if that's all
If you don't wanna get Urs, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna b no drama 'cause we have a good time

Bounce
Aww, shake that thing, c'mon
Ahh, bounce it baby
Aww, shake that thing c'mon
Good god
