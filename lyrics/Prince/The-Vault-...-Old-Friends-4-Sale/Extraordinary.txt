Extraordinary love you made 2 me
Some kind of scary
I would be a fool 2 leave you
4 I was born 2 love you, this is true
Extraordinary - the way you make me feel
I'm so very glad it's real
And not a dream
Even though it seems I'm dreaming

People tried 2 break us up
There were times a little rough
We survived cuz we had a love

Ladies and gentlemen, from Holland:
Miss Candy Dulfer

Extraordinary - I'd give the world 2 you
Each and every thing you do is so very nice
You make my clock tick 12 twice then disappear, yeah yeah yeah
Time and everything else when you are near
Extraordinary, oh oh oh!
