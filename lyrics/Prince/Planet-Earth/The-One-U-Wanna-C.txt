I know I ain't the first to tell ya
I sho bet I won't be the last
I know Ur in a hurry baby
So let me make this fast

[Chorus:]
I got a lotta money
I don't wanna spend it on me
I like pretty thangs
U're just as pretty as you can be
So if you ain't busy later
And you want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
I'm the one, the one, the one you wana C

Look around you baby
You know U've seen it all before
Every nickle in this club lookin 4 a dime
Nothing less nothing more

2 tall 2 be talked down 2
2 over it 2 be put under
Any spell a blind fisherman could cast
That's why I came like thunder to tell you

[Chorus:]

You don't need 2 fix ur hair
4 somebody you don't care 4
You don't need 2 shave Ur legs
If it ain't me that's knocking at Ur door
I know you ain't a concubine
I know you ain't a 1 nite stand
I don't wanna waste Ur time
If you wanna get creamy
I'm the one you wanna C

Oh the one you wanna C baby
Oh the one you wanna C
I'm the one you wanna C
[repeat]

Coming on you like thunder
I'm the one you wanna C
