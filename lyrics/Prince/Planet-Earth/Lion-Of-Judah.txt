Sitting on the floor of an all white room
Feeling like the color blue
Thinking about the words that I can use
2 get this through 2 you

A million mistakes and then some
I've made with the 1's B4
I probably passed my expiration date
But still I adore you... Adore you...

Looking 4 the energy 2 take you there
The place's that you wanna go
Knowing if I do, U'are fully aware
The press will turn it in to a show (A show)

Everyone expects this outcome
But still they jump 4 all the crew
I Guess should be happy but I'm still not
Sure that you realy love me...

Love me... Love me... Love me... You love me...

[Chorus:]
Like the Lion of Judah (Judah)
I Strike my enemys down
As my God is living
Surely the trumpet will sound
There was 1 who would stand by my side
Through the good and the bad
Let that 1 stand with pride
The best that I ever had

Like the lion of judah

Driving away with a smile on my face
Wind blowing through my hair
Wondering how U'll feel when you find out
How much I really care (I care)

Hoping that the tears roll down U'are face (Down U'are face)
Your body grasp who we are (Who are we?)
2 gypsy beggars who only by Vegas
Came 2 be a star
(A super star)
A star
That's what we are...

[Chorus:]

Like the Lion of Judah (Judah)
I strike my enemys down
Like the lion of judah (Judah)
Surely you.... Gonna hear the trupet sound
Hear the trumpet will sound

(ohhh)
Lion... Judah... Judah...

The Lion of Judah
