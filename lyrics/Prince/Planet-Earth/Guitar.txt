Owwww
Like I love my guitar

[Verse]
Get Dirty At the club were in
Use it around your waist like a chain within
I got that call so I jumped in my car
I love you baby
But not like I Love my Guitar

[Chorus:]
No
Not like I love my Guitar

[Verse]
You couldn't do it all by yourself
You had to go and get someboduy else
Your High enough to call me
But you can't reach the phone
I love you baby
But not like I love my guitar

[Chorus:]
No
Not like I love my Guitar
Turn it up

[Verse]
I tried to warn you
That its hard to be a star
Especially when your driving other peoples car
Would of gave you mine girl
But you took it to far
I Love you baby
Just not like I love my guitar

[Chorus:]
No
Not like I love my Guitar

[Verse]
I know you love me
And you want to be Friends
And if you don't at least you need to pretend
We'll still be together
If we don't get that far
I love you baby but not like I love this guitar

I love you baby and I wish you well
I'll write a letter when I learn how to spell
Until the day you can go to hell
I love you baby you know the rest
