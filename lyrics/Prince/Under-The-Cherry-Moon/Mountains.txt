Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
17 mountains stood so high
The sea surrounded them and 2gether they would be
The only thing that ever made U cry

U said the devil told U that another mountain would appear
Every time somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would one day overflow with all your tears
And love will always leave U lonely

CHORUS:
But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if U just believe (Oh yeah!)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater (oh), U and me

Once upon a time in a haystack of despair
Happiness is sometime hard 2 find there
Africa divided, hijack in the air
It's enough 2 make U wanna lose your mind

CHORUS

Guitars and drums on the 1, huh
(Bobby on the drum-ah)
Yeah!

It's only mountains (oh yeah) and the sea
(And the girls say)
There's nothing greater (oh), U and me

(Starvation)
Ow!

Mountains , uh
