Girls an' boys

He only knew her for a little while
But he had grown accustomed to her style
She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen
He did too, they were meant to be

They loved to kiss on the steps of Versailles
It looked like rain, mama, birds do fly

I love you, baby, I love you so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space an' joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys

He gave her all the love that anyone can
But she was promised to another man
He tried so hard not to go insane
Birds do fly, looks like rain

I love you, baby, I love you so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space an' joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys

Life is precious, baby, love is so rare
I can take the breakup if you say that you care
He had to run away, his pride was too strong
It started rainin', baby, the birds were gone

I love you baby, I love you so much
Maybe, maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space an' joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys

I love you baby, I love you so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space an' joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys

I love you baby, I love you so much
An' maybe we can stay in touch
Meet me in another world, space an' joy
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys

I want you, baby, I want you so much
Maybe, maybe we can stay in touch
Another world, space, lips, face

Happiness in it's uncut form
Is the feelin' that I get, you're warm, warm
Happy's what I get when we do, what we do
Happiness, mama, is bein' with you, good Lord
Meet me somewhere after dawn, Lord

I love you baby, I love you so much
Maybe we can stay in touch
I love you baby, I love you so much

Vous etes belle, so, like, I saw you from across the room
And, honey, you danced so hard I smelled your perfume
And the look on your lips said, "That, a
We could talk some more, some more on this dance floor, baby"
Hear the words I'm sayin', feel the s** I'm layin'
Naughty's what I wanna be with you tonight, tonight

Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys
Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls an' boys
Girls an' boys
