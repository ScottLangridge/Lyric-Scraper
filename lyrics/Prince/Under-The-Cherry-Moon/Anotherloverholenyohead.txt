I gave my love, I gave my life
I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable
I guess I gave you all of my time
And now you plead insanity
And you don't even know the score
Why can't you learn 2 play the game, baby?
Don't you know that you need more? (More, more, more, more)

You need another lover
Like you need a hole in yo?? Head (Baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in yo?? Bed (Yeah, yeah)

We were brothers and sisters {lines repeat in bg}
United all 4 love
Now all of a sudden you try 2 fight it
You say you?? Ve had enough
Even though we had (big) fun
You want another someone, yo?? Happily ever after be
(As sure as there?? S a sun)
Sho??, sho?? As the sun, I wanna be the one
You don't understand? Face 2 face, baby, I'll tell you down on my knees
Yeah yeah

You need another lover
Like you need a hole in yo?? Head (Baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in yo?? Bed (Solo, solo)

(Sinkin??)
Yeah, oh Lord

You need another lover
You know there ain't no other

You need another lover
Like you need a hole in yo?? Head
Hole in yo?? Head {x2}
[(I do believe you?? Re on the rebound now)]
You need another lover
Like you need a hole, a hole, a hole, a hole, uh

You need another lover (Well)
You know there ain't no other

There's gonna be a riot if you don't clap your hands
If you don't make that funky stand
Everybody... {fade out}
You know there ain't no other
