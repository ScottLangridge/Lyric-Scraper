Les enfants qui mentent ne vont pas au paradis
{Children who lie don't go 2 heaven}
(Ok) ok, merci {Ok, thank U}

When I lie awake in my boudoir
I think of you, dear
Do you think of me?
Or do you lie, do you lie?

When I'm in a sad and lonely mood, dear
I cry 4 you, dear (I cry 4 U)
Do you cry 4 me?
Do you cry, do you cry?

When I need someone 2 talk 2
U're not around
When I need another human's touch
I wear a frown cuz U're Uptown

Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down

I... I... I don't lie 2 you (I don't lie)
When I say that I'm in love, mama (Mama, mama)
I feel so good when U're near (Mama, mama)
Tell me, do you feel it 2?
Do you lie, do you lie?

(Or do you cry) Do you cry from the inside out, dear?
Or are they only artificial tears? (Artificial tears)
Do you really mean it when you cry, when you cry, when you cry? (Cry)

When I need someone 2 talk 2 (Do you lie?)
U're not around, U're not around (U're not around, I wear a frown)
When I need another human touch (Tell me why)
I wear a frown cuz U're Uptown
(Tell me why you wanna go and leave me all alone)

Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down (Goin' down)
Goin' down (down), goin' down (down), goin' down (down)
Goin' down (down), goin' down (down), down (down)

When I lie awake in my boudoir (I think of U)
I think of you, dear (Do you?)
Do y'all think of me?
Do you lie, do you lie?
