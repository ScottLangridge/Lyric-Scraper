You don't have 2 be beautiful
2 turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
2 turn me out
You just leave it all up 2 me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

You don't have 2 be rich
2 be my girl
You don't have 2 be cool
2 rule my world
Aint no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

Kiss

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me
You can't be 2 flirty, mama
I know how 2 undress me (yeah)
I want 2 be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time

You don't have 2 be rich
2 be my girl
You don't have 2 be cool
2 rule my world
Aint no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

Kiss

Yes
I think I wanna dance
Gotta, gotta
Little girl wendys parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta

Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama (not your shoe size)
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have 2 watch dynasty
2 have an attitude
You just leave it all up 2 me
My love will be your food
Yeah

You don't have 2 be rich
2 be my girl
You don't have 2 be cool
2 rule my world
Aint no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

Kiss
