Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
Whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy cuz he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy cuz I wanted 2 see him again
But sometime, sometimes life ain't always the way
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
All good things, they say, never last {x2}
Love, it isn't love until it's past

Thank you
