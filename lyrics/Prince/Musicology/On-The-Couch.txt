Come on, baby
Don't make me sleep on the couch
Love Jones is on the TV again, baby
Eye wanna go down south, yeah

Oh come on, baby
It's undignified 2 sleep alone
That's what all the people that
Ain't got nobody do -
Talkin' on the telephone

Don't make me crash
Don't make me sleep
Without Ur kiss
Tossin' and-a-turnin'
With every inch of me yearnin'
Don't make me, don't make me
Don't cha make me, don't cha make me
Don't cha make me suffer this

Eye know we agreed...
Eye know we agreed 2 b married
U shouldn't have let me unzip Ur dress
Why'd U do it, baby?
Confess U tease
Unless U please
Don't make me, don't make me
Sleep on the couch
