Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

Eye heard Ur voice this morning calling gout my name
It had been so long since Eye heard it that it didn't sound quite the same, no
But it let me know that my name had never really been spoken b4
B4 the day Eye carried you through the bridal path door

And ever since that day Eye haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth

Chorus
Eye just can't stop writing songs about you
Eye love you so much
Eye just can't wait 2 get my arms around you
And feel Ur touch
If eye don't c you real soon baby girl
Eye might go insane
Eye know it's only been about 3 hours
But Eye love it when you call my name

Eye heard a voice on the news saying people want 2 stop the war
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd 4get what they were fighting 4
What's the matter with the world 2day?
The land of the free? Somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home
They'll only c you and me making love inside

Chorus

Eye've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night Eye saw it with you
It let me know Eye'd never seen the moon b4
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws
But 2 compare it 2 a beauty like Urs would give 1 pause
Nothing about you is false, that's why Ur love is real
God 4bid if you belonged 2 another Eye'd have 2 steal you
Eye'd have 2 take you from Ur man
Eye might b tempted 2 break the law round here
Because Ur beauty, it gives 1 pause
It slows me down

Chorus
