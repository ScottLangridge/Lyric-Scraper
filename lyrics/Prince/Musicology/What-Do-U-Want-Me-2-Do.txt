I see you picked me out from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar?
Master of the soft, not 2 loud
One day, maybe I will be a star
I see you picked me out like you want something
But shame on you, baby, can't you see this ring?

Chorus:
What do you want me 2 do, girl?
What do you want me 2 do, babe?
What do you want me 2 do, girl?
What do you want me 2 do, babe?

I got a woman, you got a man
So we got 2 do what's right
I said U'd get beheaded in other lands
If I were in your arms 2night
Quit tryin' 2 get me under that icy plunder
Boy, oh boy, what a scare, ooh

Chorus

You picked me out of the crowd
And ooh, just so bold and so proud
And dressed like you want everybody 2 just say, "Wow!
Didn't her mama teach her better? "
Ow, dressed like that, somebody gon' get her

I see you picked me from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar?
Master of the soft, not 2 loud
I don't ever really wanna be where you are, where you are, no

What do you want me 2 do, girl?
Tell me, what do you want me 2 do, babe?
What do you want me 2 do, girl?
Tell me, tell me, what do you want me 2 do, babe?
I ain't tryin' 2 do that
What do you want me 2 do, girl?
