Heard about the party now
Just east o' Harlem
Dougie's gonna b there
But you got 2 call him

Even the soldiers
Need a break sometimes
Listen 2 the groove ya'll
Let it unwind ur mind

No intoxication
Unless you c what eye c
Dancin hot n' sweaty
Right in font of me

Call it what you like
I'm gonna call it how it b
This is just another one
Of God's gifts
Musicology

Keep that party movin
Just like eye told you
Kick the old school joint
4 the true funk soldiers
Musicology

Wish eye had a dollar
4 everytime you say
Don't you miss the feeling
Music gave ya
Back in the day?

Let's Groove
September
Earth, Wind and Fire
Hot Pants by James
Sly's gonna take you higher

Minor keys and drugs
Don't make a rollerskate jam
Take ur pick - turntable or a band?

If it ain't Chuck D
Or Jam Master Jay
Know what?
They're losin'
'Cause we got a Phd in
Advanced Body Movin'

Keep the party movin'
Just like eye told you
Kick the old school joint
4 the true funk soldiers
Musicology
