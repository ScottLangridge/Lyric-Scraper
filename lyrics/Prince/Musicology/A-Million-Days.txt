It's only been a hour since you left me
But it feels like a million days
If Eye had a magic wand eye could turn back time
Eye'd never let you go away

Eye didn't have the heart 2 say eye'm sorry
Now eye haven't got a heart at all
Eye could tolerate the pain if eye could talk 2 my best friend
But you won't even call

Eye'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase
And packing everything eye own
Eye didn't back then but eye do know now
Wherever you are is home
Eye'll crawl on my belly and beg you
But Ur so far away
U've only been gone 4 an hour
But it seems like a million days

It's only been a hour since you left me
Eye wish eye had somebody 2 blame
But Ur the perfect picture of what love should look like
And eye wanna b Ur frame
It's only been a hour but it feels like a million days

A million days
One hundred thousand million days
Come home, come home baby
Eye can't take this no more
Well, come home baby oh yeah
Baby, eye know eye shouldn't put my faith in heroes
But eye can't c you any other way
It's only been a hour since you left me girl
Feels like a million, feels like a million days

Come home baby
