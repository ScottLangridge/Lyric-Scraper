Mm
What if half the things ever said
Turned out 2 be a lie...
How will u know the truth?
If u were given all the answers
Would u stop 2 wonder why?
And how will u know the truth?

Everybodys got a right to love
Everybodys got a right to lie
But the choice u make aint no piece of cake
It aint no mf piece of pie

{clock ticks}

What if times only reason?
Was to give us all somethin 2 fear?
And if so yall, the end of the journeys so clear

Questionnaire, who did u stand 4?
Questionnaire, who did u save?
When it gets right down to the wait a minute
When it gets right down to the nitty of the gritty
When it gets right down to it u took more than u gave

Everybodys got a right to love
Everybodys got a right to lie
But the choice u make aint no piece of cake
It aint no mfmf {o(+> screams the following} piece of pie {computer blips}

Mmmm oh
Gotta tell the truth yall
Gotta tell the truth
Gotta tell the truth yall
Gotta tell the truth
Gotta tell the truth yall
Gotta tell the truth

If there was just one day
That everybody tell the truth
We'd all trade bank accounts & move to Neptune
