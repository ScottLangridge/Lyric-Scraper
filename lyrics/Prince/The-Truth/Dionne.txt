Well
Dionne
You should have held my hand
You should have let me be your man
Dionne
You should have closed your eyes
You should have held on with both hands 2 your prize
Dionne
You should have let me down easy
If you had no plans 2 please me
Dionne

Dionne
I could have been the 1
I could have shown you the shelter reserved unther the sun
Dionne, Dionne
I could have whispered U'are name
I could have whispered U'are name if only 4 fun
Dionne
You should have let me down easy
If you had no plans 2 please me
Dionne, Dionne
Dionne

Dionne

Dionne, Dionne
We could have shared a martini
We could have danced 2 Mancini, till dawn
Dionne
I should have broke down and kissed you
I should have I just miss you
Dionne
