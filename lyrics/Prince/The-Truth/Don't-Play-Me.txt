Don't play me
I'm over 30 & I don't smoke weed
I put my ass away & music I've played
Aint the type of stereo U're tryin to feed
Don't play me
Don't play me
I use proper English & I'm straight
I'm in the news again for paying dues my friend
And not the type of ganda you prop in my way
Don't play me

Don't play me
I've been to the mountain top & it aint what you say
Don't play me

Don't play me
I'm the wrong color & I play guitar
My only competition is well in the past
Time & time if time existed movin ever so fast
Don't play me

You couldn't play enough of me now
2 make me feel like a star
Don't play me I already do in my car
Don't play me

Don't be mad at me
The curtain puller in the game
Maybe how you call us Niggers aint the same
It's all good when you know the only fame
Is the light that comes from God & the joy you get to say his name
Don't play me

Don't play me
I've seen to the mountain top & it aint what you say
Don't play me

Already got laid
