Cool as the other side of the pillow
Smooth as another glass of wine, oh yes sir
I'm so glad ure my baby, oh yeah
I'm so glad that ure mine
Bad as bonny when she ran with barrow {clyde}, yeah
When you kiss me, feels like I'm committing a crime, oh yeah
You use furniture in new ways, yes you do
I can't find the adjectives enough to say
I'm so glad ure my baby... Okay (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Cool as the other side of the pillow (oh baby)
So smooth there's another glass of wine (bubbly, bubbly)
I'm so glad ure mine, ure my baby (oh yes I am), oh yes I am (oh yes I am)
I'm so glad ure mine

Cool as the other side (ure my baby) of the pillow
Smooth, I wanna drink you all out
How did you learn that trick with the... Chair?
I don't care
Just as long as you do it again

Cool as the other side, cool as the other side, cool as the other..
Cool as the other, cools as the other side...
As the other side of the pillow, baby
Cool (cool),
Glas of wine
Ill get tipsy and I... {whistling}
Cool as the other side of the pillow
Cool
