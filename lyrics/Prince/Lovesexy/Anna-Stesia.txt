Have U ever been so lonely
That U felt like U were the only one in this world?
Have U ever wanted 2 play with someone so much
U'd take any one boy or girl?

CHORUS:
Anna Stesia come 2 me, talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way
So I danced
Music late, nothing great
No way 2 differentiate
I took a chance

Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips 2 say
"We could live 4 a little while
If U could just learn 2 smile
U and I could fly away, fly away"
Oh?

CHORUS:
Anna Stesia come 2 me, talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps U could show me, baby

Anna Stesia come 2 me, talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn 2 love
Ah, if I was just closer 2 somethin' (Closer)
Closer 2 your higher self? I don't know
Closer 2 heaven? Maybe
Closer 2 God {x3}

Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget that U are the rule
U are my God, I am Your child
From now on, 4 U I shall be wild
I shall be quick, I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story no matter how long
No matter how... (No matter {x4})

We're just a play in Your master plan
Now, my Lord, I understand
(I understand)

Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above {repeat till end}

CHORUS:
Anna Stesia come 2 me, talk 2 me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what U think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time
