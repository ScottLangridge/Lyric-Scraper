I'm goin' down 2 Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so s*** (She'll want me from my head 2 my feet)

I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird
A white rad ride, '66, so glam - it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat and drive her, where?
(2 Tennessee) Yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Greg Boyer on the trombone, good God

On the one
Clap your hands somebody, somebody clap your hands
Clap your hands somebody, somebody, kick drum

I like country music 2, whoo

E, Vegas, aye!
