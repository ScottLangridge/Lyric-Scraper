Wanna get lost in the mellow Mellow of my mind
Chop a tree, pay the cost
I rather have a glass of you that's fine
Come on over baby 'round 7
Chill in ur favorite chair

You can watch a tape of this mellow afterparty
Macy and Common were there
Besides, you know... It takes... Awhile... 4 me... 2 do... My... Hair

Come on get lost in the mellow Mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow Mellow

How's that feel?

Where you wanna eat 2nite baby?
I know this dope spot called one another
Or maybe we might swing by the Egg
The perfect place 2 play house
I could smother you
I just might be runnin' lines
There's just so much you can find
In the mellow of my mind

This rainbow psychedelia
Come and get lost in the Mellow
There ain't nothin' 2 b afraid of
Just you and me in the mellow of my mind

I wanna get lost in the composition of you
Learn the rhythm and play only the notes you want me 2
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under you and let you show me how you want ur man 2 b
I could dance 4 you- a little comical minuet
If you desire I'll shed my attire
Anything 2 get you wet.

Shower, my flower?
So much 2 do, so little time
So choose wisely and you can find thee
In the Mellow of my mind

Can I sing 2 you while you bring urself 2 joy?
I'll go slow at first, while you quench ur thirst
Wet circles round the toy
While you bring urself 2 joy

As she fell in2 the Sensual Everafter, out of bodyout of mind,
She stroked her hair a hundred times.
And as she fell deeper in2 the hypnotic unwind, he counted his way in2 the suggestive mind.
Planting a seed that bears fruit on the tree,
He said, "Repeat after me. Repeat after me. Repeat after me. 1+1+1 is 3"
