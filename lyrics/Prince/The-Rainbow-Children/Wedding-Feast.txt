"Brother dear brother, I came as quickly as I could
The Digital Haze is broken, The Banished Ones are gone 4 good, gone 4 good"

Now there must b a wedding
Now there must b a feast
A feast, a feast
A smorgasbord at least
A brunch, a munch
Of cake if just a piece

Not just a vat of chitlins
Or turkey meat you c
We are what we eat
So we must eat a leaf
We'll dine under a tree
Unless it snows!
