If ur Last December came
What would you do?
Would anybody remember
2 remember you?

Did you stand tall?
Or did you fall?
Did you give ur all?

Did you ever find a reason
Y you had 2 die?
Or did you just plan on leaving
Without wondering y?

Was it everything it seemed?
Or did it feel like a dream?
Did you feel redeemed?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as one

Did you love somebody
But got no love in return?
Did you understand the real meaning of love?
That it just is and never yearns?

When the truth arrives
Will you b lost on the other side?
Will you still b alive?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as one

In ur life did you just give a little
Or did you give all that you had?
Were us just somewhere in the middle?
Not 2 good, not 2 bad?

In the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
We need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as one
