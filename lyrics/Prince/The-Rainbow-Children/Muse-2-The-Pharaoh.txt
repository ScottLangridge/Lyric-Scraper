Come on y'all, uh!
Ooh, ooh darling, oh
If she could be muse 2 the Pharaoh
Then one day she might be queen
If like Sheba, she then could bring presents and wine
The helix - he might get between them
In other words - intertwine
With the ebony milk of her thighs, yeah
She could be muse and let him decide
Perhaps she'll let him decide
She could be muse, yeah

There is nothing he wouldn't give her, see?
4 the future of the nation rests in belly
And if the Proverb of the 31 and verse 10
Becomes the song she sings again and again
She might be queen

Keep clappin', y'all

If she could be muse 2 the Pharaoh
One day she might be queen

Take a load off sweetie darling
Let me run agenda through your hair
There's so much information 4 the next generation
Who gonna drop it if U're not there?
And whether the enemy makes a run on the palace
Or whether the enemy does not
The children will be laced with the protection of the word of God
The opposite of nato is monotheism

And if the number 13 is such a bad luck number
When there's no such thing as luck
The berries, talons, arrows and stars
Are all superstitions, what the....
Get busy, big baby cuz when dem devil come
They come dressed as light
Maybe they gon' fool the untrained mind
But nobody I know gon' bite
Like a thief in the night, my Lord come and strike
Leave nothing but ashes 2 the left, dust 2 the right
Holocaust aside, many lived and died
When all truth is told, would you rather be dead or be sold?
Sold 2 the one who can now mate
The displaced bloodline with the white jail bait
Thinkin' like the keys on 'Nato's piano just fine

So there it is - 4 you 2 see
What's beyond you and me
Depends my friends primarily
On how you view your role in eternity

If she could be muse 2 the Pharaoh
Then one day she might be queen
