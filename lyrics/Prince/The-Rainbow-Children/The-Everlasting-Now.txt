I knew this dude
He was very cool
He used 2 rule
Until he went 2 school

Not a normal school
That breeds a fool
But the ones that teaches
Men aren't fit to rule

That's when he took his pearly crown
He raised it up and spun it 'round
And tossed in2 the deep blue underground

No longer lead by the ways of men
He looked 4 the kingdom deep within
That's when the drums in his head began 2 pound

Don't let nobody bring you down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the Everlasting Now
Join the party, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

Now turn the page, at an early age
This brutha on stage, he was all the rage
He taught an integrated world 2 sing
The color you are don't mean a thing
Everybody's a star all the everyday people sang

He changed the funk, put it in a bag
Then he changed the colors of the flag
But you can't teach a dog new tricks if his tail don't wag
Don't know matter how much money you made
All the cars you got and all the women you laid
Mess with the flag and 2 them u're still a spade

Don't let nobody bring you down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the Everlasting Now
Join the party, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

See this girl in her make-believe world
Plastic boobs and clip-on curls
'Round the pole see her big butt twirl
There are the dreams that do unfurl
Never everlasting

Don't let anybody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

Watch that girl in her make-believe world
Plastic boobs and clip-on curls
'Round the pole see her big butt twirl
Electric beaches skin do bake
Vanilla fudge and wedding cake
If you should die b4 you wake
You got any last requests 2 make?

The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now

Johnny, B. Well and bring the beat

From this day forward 'til times indefinite, those who love Christ are the
Ones who benefit. All the players' ice melted in2 one platinum chain and in
A downward spiral it dropped down the chain.

"U know, this is funky but I wish he'd play like he used 2, old scragglyhead."

Don't let nobody bring you down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the Everlasting Now
Join the party, come on make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
Now, now, now
The Everlasting Now
