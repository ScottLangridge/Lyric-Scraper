Lay down your funky weapon.
Yeah y'all, here we go
Pumpin' the big noise in the 90's.

Pardon me 4 living, but this is my world 2
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to you
Pardon me 4 breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
The problem with you and your kind is that you don't know love is there

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting 4.
We are the new power generation, we want 2 change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what 2 do.

Pardon me 4 thinking, but there's something under my hair
I bet you thought the lights were on but noone's living there
You think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?
I hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting 4.
We are the new power generation, we want 2 change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what 2 do.

We are the new, We are the new, We are the new,
Making love and music
New power, we stand

Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if you didn't come 2 party child, I think you better get up offa my block.

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting 4.
We are the new power generation, we want 2 change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is you.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas,
We're sick and tired of you telling us what 2 do.
Why don't you just be happy, baby.

[chorus repeated with this sung over it]
Go on and get up offa my block
Get up offa my block, because
Love is there if you'd just open up 2 it.
If you'd just believe your whole world would change

New power generation, you've got to rearrange. We've got
We are the new power generation, you've gotta give up all the fight
We gotta try 2 love one another, baby. We are the new power generation
We are the new power generation.
We are the new power generation.
