When I'm mad I'll get ya with my chicken grease - get with it

(One more!)

Are U ready Paris? Soul clap
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Gimme the bass, gimme the bass one time

{Poem by Edward Lear titled "The Table And The Chair"}

I.
Said the Table 2 the Chair
"U can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet"
"If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk
Pray let us take the air"
Said the Table 2 the Chair
(Can't nobody fuck with us {repeat})

II.
Said the Chair unto the Table
"Now U know we are not able
How foolishly U talk
When U know we cannot walk"
Said the Table with a sigh
"It can do no harm 2 try
I've as many legs as U
Why can't we walk on 2?" (Say...)

III.
So they both went slowly down
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened 2 their side
"See! The Table and the Chair
Have come 2 take the air"
(Paris, y'all, can't nobody...) (Say it y'all)

IV.
But in going down an alley
2 a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, 2 see them safely back
They paid a Ducky-quack
And a Beetle, and a Mouse
Who took them 2 their house

V.
When they whispered 2 each other
"O delightful little brother
What a lovely walk we've taken
Let us dine on Beans and Bacon"
So the Ducky, and the leetle (Say it, y'all)
Browny-Mousey and the Beetle
Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled 2 their beds

Good God, uh!

(Can't nobody fuck with us) {repeat by crowd}
What?

Revolution, break it way down low
Beautiful night, y'all say it (Beautiful night)
Oh, beautiful night, y'all say it (Beautiful night)
Say what, beautiful night, y'all say it (Beautiful night)
Yeah, beautiful night, y'all say it (Beautiful night)

Come on
Oh wee oh, oh oh! Say it (Oh wee oh, oh oh)
Say it loud, y'all (Oh wee oh, oh oh) {x2}
Miko, Miko, hit me in the back
Fellas

Beautiful night, y'all say it
It's gonna be a beautiful night, y'all say it
Everybody feeling alright, y'all say it
Say, it's gonna be a beautiful night, y'all say it
Everybody, oh wee oh, oh oh
Say it, oh wee oh, oh oh
Say it (Oh wee oh, oh oh)
(Oh wee oh, oh oh)
Give me the horns again
Keep singin' y'all
Everybody clap your hands {x2}
Everybody, groove, come on

Confusion!

Yeah!
