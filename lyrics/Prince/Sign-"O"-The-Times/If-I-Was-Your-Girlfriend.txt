You can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it 4 you
Of course I'll undress in front of you!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
How can I make you see that it's cool?
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, 4 you naked I would dance a ballet
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me?
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
Would you let me tickle you so hard ud laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there

Ill do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce

And together well stare into silence
And well try 2 imagine what it looks like
Yeah, well try 2 imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, well try 2 imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, well try...
