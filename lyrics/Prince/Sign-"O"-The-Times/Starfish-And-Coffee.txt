It was 7: 45, we were all in line 2 greet the teacher Miss Kathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us were ordinary compared 2 Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line, a smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day
If you asked her what she had 4 breakfast, this is what she'd say

Starfish and coffee, maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine, a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby, maybe U'd understand
Starfish and coffee, maple syrup and jam

Cynthia wore the prettiest dress but different color socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates were in her lunchbox (Oh ooh oh)
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around (Oh ooh oh)
Lucy cried, I almost died, you know what we found

Chorus:
Starfish and coffee, maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine and a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby, maybe U'd understand
Starfish and coffee, maple syrup and jam

Starfish and coffee

Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she draws
On every wall, in every school, but it's alright, it's 4 a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia!
Keep sayin'...

Chorus

(La la la la...)
Starfish and coffee, love 4 the soul {x2}
