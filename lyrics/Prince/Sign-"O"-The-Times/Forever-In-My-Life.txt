La da da da da da da da {x2}

There comes a time in every man's life
When he gets tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a 3-ring circus
Some day drive a body down 2 the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me wanna settle down

But baby, it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell you that I wanna with you (And baby, if you do 2)
And baby, if you do 2
Oh 4ever, 4ever
Baby, I want you 4ever
I wanna keep you 4 the rest of my life (you can make right)
All that is wrong in my world, you can make right
(you are my savior, you are my light)
You are my savior, you are my light (4ever I want you in my life)
4ever I want you in my life (La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da)

(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey (Don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own, yeah (I'm at that road)
I'm here 2 tell you that I'm at that road
(And I'd rather walk with you than walk it alone)
And I'd rather walk it with you than walk it alone (you are my future)
You are my hero, you are my future (No past)
When I am with you, I have no past
Oh baby, my one and only desire (Make this feelin' last)
Is find some way in this doggone world 2 make this feelin' last
(Sugar, it's true)

(I know I do)
Oh baby, it's true... Huh, I know I do (Wanna with U)
And I just wanna tell you that I wanna with you, yeah
Baby, if you do 2
Oh 4ever, 4ever
I want you baby, baby, 4ever (you can make right)
I wanna keep you 4 the rest of my life
(you are my savior, you are my light)
All that's wrong in my world, mama, you can make right
(4ever I want you in my life)
You are my savior, you are my light (La da da da da da da da)
4ever I want you in my life (La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da)

4ever in my life {x2}
