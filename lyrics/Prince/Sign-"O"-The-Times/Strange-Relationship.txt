I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem 2 get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on 2?

Chorus:
Baby, I just can't stand 2 see you happy
More than that, I hate 2 see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship.. Ship.. Ship.. Ship?

I came and took your love, I took your body
I took the self-respect you ever had
I took you 4 a ride and baby, I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

Cuz baby, I just can't stand 2 see you happy
More than that, I hate 2 see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship.. Ship.. Ship.. Ship?

Oh yeah

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie?
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby, I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way you were, so I had 2 make you mine

Chorus

Yeah
Mmm, my strange relationship
Can't live with cha, can't live without cha
What it's all about, do you know?
Whoa yeah
Don't you think we got some strange relationship?
I think you and I got a... Strange relationship
What's this strange relationship?
Yeah, yeah {repeat 2 fade}
