When we're dancing close and slow
I never want 2 let you go, no no
I feel your warm embrace
The softness of your face
Tell me baby, are we here alone?

When we're kissing long and hard
I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind
S**-related fantasy
Is all that my mind can see
Baby, that's honestly the way I feel

When we're dancing close and slow
I'm not afraid 2 let my feelings show
I want 2 come inside of you
I want 2 hold you when we're through
Can't you feel my love touching you?
