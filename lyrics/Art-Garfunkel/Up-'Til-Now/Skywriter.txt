I'm tired of tracing vapor trail, ghost letters in the sky
Living life in daydreams, watching precious time get by
Circle around this great big world, just chasing smoke
And never touching ground

Like a skywriter, rebel without a cause, drifting without an aim

But I can't seem to give up this flying game
I'm a wing walker, working without a net
That's all I've ever been
And I wonder if I'm ever coming down again

Some people say, I'm losing touch with harsh reality
Because I can't accept the way it is with you and me
Stop living in the past, like some old pilot from
A war that wouldn't end

Like a barnstormer
Safe with my heart and wings
How could I ever fall
So serenely do I glide above it all

I'm a skywriter
I can't forget you yet
For whatever that it's worth
And then sometimes I think
I'm never coming back

Skywriter
I can't forget you yet
For whatever that it's worth
And then sometimes I think
I'm never coming back to earth
