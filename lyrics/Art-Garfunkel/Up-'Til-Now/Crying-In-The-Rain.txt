I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heart aches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
They could never wash away my memories
Since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool, but till then darling you'll
Never see me complaining
I'll do my crying in the rain

Since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complaining

I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain

I know where to hide my eyes

Crying, crying, crying

I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
