Many a tear has to fall
But It's All In The Game.
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love.
You have words with him
And your future's looking dim, 
But these things your hearts can rise above.
Once in a while he won't call, 
But It's All In The Game.
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet refrain.
And he'll kiss your lips, 
And caress your waking fingertips, 
And your hearts will fly away.
And he'll kiss your lips, 
And caress your waking fingertips, 
And your hearts will fly away, 
And your hearts will fly away.
And your hearts will fly... 
And your hearts will fly...
