Close your eyes my pretty child, though the night is dark and the wind is wild.
I will stand beside your bed, tonight there is nothing you need fear or dread.
You can sleep now, go to sleep, the rain falls and the windows weep.
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby.

Close your eyes my sister fair, though the snow is falling and the trees are bare.
And I will hold you by the hand, tonight there is nothing you need try to understand.
You can sleep now, go to sleep. The daytime's dying and the nighttime's so deep.
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby.

Close your eyes my mother wise when the waves are angry and the north train cries.
I stopped those ghosts outside your door, Mama, don't worry about those ghosts no more.
You can sleep now, go to sleep, tomorrow comes but it will keep,
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby, another lullaby, another lullaby, another lullaby.
