Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour

Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

Through our years together
We have had stormy weather
But our love has been so strong
That's love, how we carry on

Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

You brought joy in my empty life
All that was wrong, you made it right
My love, my love, my love

Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy, oh how happy

Oh how happy
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
