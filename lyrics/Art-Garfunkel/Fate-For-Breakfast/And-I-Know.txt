Funny, how we're all so blind
Love is gentle, love is kind in the nighttime
Funny we can be so sad
It doesn't have to be so bad in the daytime
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime
One of these days, we'll go and find out where they stay

Once upon a lover's song
There was a boy, who sang along in the nighttime
Once upon a lover's dream
There was a tale of broken wings in the daytime
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime
One of these days, we'll go and find out where they stay

And I know
Love will come someday
And I know
Love will find a way
And I know
Love will come some way
And I know
Love will change your day
The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing, yea

Catch a piece of falling star
Try to keep it in a jar till the morning
Catch a summer firefly
Pray that it'll stay alive till the dawning
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime
One of these days, we'll go and find out where they stay

And I know
Love will come someday
And I know
Love will find a way
And I know
Love will come some way
And I know
Love will change your day
The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing

Love will come some day
And I know
Love will find a way
And I know
Love will come some way
And I know
Love will change your day
And I know
Love will come some day

And I know
Love will find a way
And I know
Love will come some way
And I know
Love will change your day
And I know
