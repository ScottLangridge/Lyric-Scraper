She doesn't want me, she doesn't care, 
I've tried so hard to let her know, but she doesn't see me there.
What else can I do When Someone Doesn't Want You?
The picture's painted, I've been denied, 
The artist couldn't fit me in, there wasn't room for me inside.
What else can I do When Someone Doesn't Want You?

When the day is over, the stars are in the sky, 
I'll be going, I know that this is good-bye.
No tears will ever take her place, 
They'll disappear, but will the memory linger on

After the pain is gone?
On a river, in my boat, 
I'll save this sinking heart of mine, 
Somehow I will stay afloat.
What else can I do When Someone Doesn't Want You?

When Someone Doesn't Want You, When Someone Doesn't Want You, 
(When that someone... When she doesn't want you.)
When Someone Doesn't Want You, 
(When that someone... When she doesn't want you.)
When Someone Doesn't Want You.
(Repeat and Fade)
