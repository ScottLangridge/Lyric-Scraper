I've had many times I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I'd had my share of that

But these 'miss you nights'
Midnight diamonds stud my heaven
Southward burning like the jewels that line her place
And the warm winds that embrace me

Just as surely kissed your face
Yet these 'miss you nights'
Are the longest

(How I miss you)
How I miss you
I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man, and the cold daylight
Buys the pride I'd rather sell

All my secrets
(All my secrets)
Are a wasted affair

You know them well, thinkin' of my goin'
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind
Looking moon wards for my compass
I take each day as it arrives

(Lay down)
Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killin' time
(Play down)
Play down all dreams once remembered
It's just the same, this miss you game

These 'miss you nights'
Are forever
(They're forever)
