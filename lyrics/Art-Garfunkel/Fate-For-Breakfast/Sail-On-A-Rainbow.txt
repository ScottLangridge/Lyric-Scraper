I heard a nightingale croon last night in town.
I smiled up at the moon, had another round.
You've got to be the prettiest girl I've found, 
And I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow.
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain.
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow, 
Till I hold you in my arms again.
In sunny spring we were sweethearts
Sleeping in the sand.
Our love was an endless dream, 
No one could understand.
Just like pennies from heaven, 
I know I cannot fail, 
And I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow.
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain.
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms again.
So, I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow.
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain.
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms, till I hold you in my arms, 
Till I hold you in my arms again, till I hold you in my arms again.
Till I hold you in my arms, till I hold you in my arms again.
