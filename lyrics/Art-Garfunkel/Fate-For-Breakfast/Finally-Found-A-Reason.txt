(M. Sembello, D. Batteau, are. Bell, C. Bickhardt)
Finally Found A Reason to live,
No words can fill my head.
Finally, here at ease, I'm within
The light that fills my head.
And I Finally Found A Reason to live,
And I never knew the way to begin.
Waiting on a wish in a well,
That day may never come.
I've been known to follow my mind,
Those days are far behind.
And I Finally Found A Reason to live,
And I never knew the way to begin.
But now that I see your face,
My world is a better place.
For how can I ever leave you from my world,
Your world?
Finally found a feeling that's real,
In you, in me, I feel.
Time is just a turn of the wheel,
The way to love revealed.
And I Finally Found A Reason to live,
And I never knew the way to begin.
But now that I see your face,
My world is a better place.
For how can I ever leave you from my world,
Your world?
