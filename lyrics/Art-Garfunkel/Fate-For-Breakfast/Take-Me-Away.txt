Far away when the day is raining
Far away when the sky is blue
Anytime at all

Take me away from it all
Take me away

Long ago, where the western breezes
Used to blow here into my heart
I would hear you call

Take me away from it all
Take me away
Take me away from it all
Take me away

Love is like a melody
We simply can't forget
A sad and happy memory
We never shall regret
The magical duet

Far away when the day is sleeping
Far away where a starry sky
Waits for you to call

Take me away from it all
Take me away
Take me away from it all
Take me away

Take me away from it all
Take me away
