Wooden Planes,
Propeller's spinning in the
West Texas wind,
We ran behind
You know we laughed, we thought
our little flight would never end
You were my brother and I,
I knew you were my friend
I wish we
were chasing after wooden
airplanes....once again

The road's been long
You know I've done some good, and
yes, I guess I've done some bad,
I've sung my song
You know sometimes I swear I think
I've gone completely mad.

If the story of my life ever makes
you sad
Remember when
we were a chasing after wooden
airplanes
Yes, I believe that was the finest time
