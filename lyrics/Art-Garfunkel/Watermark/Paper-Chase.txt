You can't erase the Paper Chase
She'll make you play it 
In the bright merry morning
She'll run and hide 
And leave you the paper promises 
Behind her as she runs across the square

You can't win the race, She'll set the pace
You will hear her laughing 
Just behind the foolish fences
Throw back the gate and find the 
Piece of paper lying on the curbstone, 
But the lady won't be there.

Later in the day, 
You'll be searching for a way 
To let her know you're ready 
For her little game to end
Cause it's getting dark, and then-

You'll see her face, a glimpse of lace
And you'll go running 
Through the last sweet dying daydream
Calling her name, but she's been home an hour,
Laughing at the mirror 
As she combs her paper hair.
