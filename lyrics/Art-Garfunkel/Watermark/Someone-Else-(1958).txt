It's someone else, 
I've known it all the time
Known that you're not mine, 
And will never be
It's Someone Else, 
I saw you out last night
Holding him so tight,
And it's Someone Else.

No I really can't hate him, 
For what's happening to me
Will happen to him -
That's a certainty.

And he'll learn 
There's always someone else
Like I learned myself, 
Always Someone Else
Always Someone Else
