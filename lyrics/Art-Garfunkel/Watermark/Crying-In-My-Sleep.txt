I took a walk around the yard
Dug the flowers til it got too hard
I smoked my first pack of cigarettes today
And I watched the children play

And then I went down, down to Lucy's old Cafe
Put a half a case away
I took a sleeping pill and tried to watch tv
But you know baby the leading lady looked too much like you for the likes
Of me

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the nightstand
And the operator said, "May I help you please?"
No thanks baby there's nothing you can really do for me
I just had a bad dream, that's all that's wrong with me
I just had a bad dream

Went out to loosen up the car
Some how I wound up at the rainbow bar
I had a scotch and soda on the run
But I didn't get too far

And then I ran down, down some friends I used to know
Dragged them out to see the show
I drew myself a bath and I tried to read your book
But you know baby this time it just didn't seem quite worth the time it
Took

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the nightstand
And the operator said, "May I help you please?"
No thanks baby there's nothing you can really do for me
I just had a bad dream, that's all that's wrong with me
I just had a bad dream, that's all that's wrong with me

Crying in my sleep
Crying in my sleep (I woke up crying)
Crying in my sleep (Crying trying to find her)
Crying in my sleep (I woke up crying)
Crying in my sleep (Crying trying to find her)
Crying in my sleep
