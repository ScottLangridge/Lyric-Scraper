Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one, when you play
Pay no mind to what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

If they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give for just the right to
Hold you

And if they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give for just the right to
Hold you

From your head to your toes
You're not much, heaven knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as an be, baby of mine
You're so precious to me, baby of mine
Baby of mine
You're so precious to me, baby of mine
