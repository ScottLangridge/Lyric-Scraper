You are so wonderful
Being near you is all that I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Then I've ever known in all my days

Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

In you, there is a rare quality
Your love baby, it means the world to me
For me, you're always concerned
And you ask nothing baby, in return

You're really more than I deserve
From my heart, I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

You're really more than I deserve
From my heart, I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Sometimes I'm up, oh, sometimes I'm down
But your love, you're always around
Words of confidence, you speak to me
Baby, then you place a tender kiss on my cheek

It makes my burden a little bit lighter
It makes my life a little bit brighter
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

Baby, you're my wonderful one
[Incomprehensible] you're a wonderful one
[Incomprehensible] you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one
