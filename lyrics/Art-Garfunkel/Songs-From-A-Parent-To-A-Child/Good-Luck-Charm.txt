(Aaron Schroeder & Wally Gold)
I don't want a four leaf clover
I don't want a old horseshoe
I want your kiss
'Cause I just can't miss
With a good luck charm like you

C'mon and be my little good luck
Charm uh huh huh
You sweet delight
I got a good luck charm
Hanging on my arm
To have, to hold
Tonight

I don't want a silver dollar
A rabbit's foot on a string
Happiness and your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring

C'mon and be my little good luck
Charm, uh huh huh
You sweet delight
I got a good luck charm
Hanging on my arm

To have, to hold
Tonight

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, 
Oh yeah
Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, 
Oh yeah

If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say

C'mon and be my little good luck
Charm, uh huh huh
You sweet delight
I got a good luck charm
Hanging on my arm
To have, to hold
Tonight

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, 
Oh yeah

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, 
Oh yeah

Uh huh huh, uh huh huh, uh huh huh, 
Oh yeah
