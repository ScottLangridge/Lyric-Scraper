If I were a carpenter
I'd build a world of love
Where we would always be together

If I were the captain of
A ship of happiness
I'd sail away with you forever

Close your eyes
And know you are safe with me

If I had a lariat
Made of dreams come true
I would lasso the moon for you

If I were a rocketeer
I'd scale the universe
To bring your heart a star each
Morning

If I were an angel in
Heaven's Holy host
I'd sing to you a verse of glory

Close your eyes
And know you are safe with me

If I had a lariat
Made of dreams come true
I would lasso the moon for you.
