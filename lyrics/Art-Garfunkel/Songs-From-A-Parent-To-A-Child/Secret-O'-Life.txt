The secret of life
Is enjoying the passage of time
Any fool can do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Nobody knows how we got to the top
Of the hill
Since we're on our way down
We might as well enjoy the ride

The secret of love
Is in opening up your heart
It's okay to feel afraid
But don't let that stand in your way
'Cause anyone knows
That love is the only road
Since we' re only here for awhile
Might as well show some style
Give us a smile

Isn't it a lovely ride
Slidin' down, I'll be glidin' down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride

Now the thing about time is that time
Isn't really real
It's just your point of view
How does it feel for you
Einstein said he could never
Understand it all
Planets spinning through space
The smile upon your face
Welcome to the human race

Some kind of lovely ride
I'll be slidin' down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride

Isn't it a lovely ride
See me slidin' down, glidin' down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride

The secret of life
Is enjoying the passage of time
