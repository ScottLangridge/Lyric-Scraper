Well, the rain's fallin' down around you
So you cry yourself to sleep
I know love hurts when one doesn't love as deep

You're feelin' lost and empty
'Cause you gave yourself away
But don't be ashamed to cry, it's okay

But you've gotta hang on in
Baby, be strong
Love will always find a way

No, you can't give up
You've just gotta go on
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hang on

You keep searchin' for the reasons
As you walk the lonely halls
You wait by a telephone but he never calls

Time's the only healer
For the broken hearts of glass
Love is like the wind it too shall pass

But you've gotta hang on in
Baby, be strong
Love will always find a way

No, you can't give up
You've just gotta go on
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hang on

I know what you're goin' through
Every time you see his face
And I don't know where or when
But I know that you'll love again

Hang on in
Baby, be strong
Love will always find a way

No, you can't give up
You've just gotta go on
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day
Hang on
