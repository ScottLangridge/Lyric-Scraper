I've been so far away from you while standing by your side
There were nights we were so in love, that lovin' made us blind
But that time is so far below us now, the memory's so thin

It's so easy to begin, but it's so hard to stop, this love
It's just so hard to stop
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in
It's so easy to begin

I know I've saved some lessons from the time I fell apart
And I know you've been wondering why I look at you so hard
It's 'cause I never want to wake up some day and wonder where we've been

It's so easy to begin, but it's so hard to stop, this love
It's just so hard to stop
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in
It's so easy to begin, it's so easy to begin, it's so easy to begin
