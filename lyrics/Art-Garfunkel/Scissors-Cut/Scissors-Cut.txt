"If they ever drop the bomb," you said,
"I'll find you in the flames."
But now we act like people
Who don't know each other's names.

Well, sometimes it makes me sad, you know.
Sometimes it makes me smile.
'Cause you know how the game goes, honey.
We all eat it once in awhile.

Scissors cut paper covers
Breaks the shining scissors
You hurt me
I hurt her and she goes and you don't miss her

Now, I look around at people
Playing children's games.
And I wonder if you're still thinking
You might find me somewhere in the flames.

Scissors cut paper covers
Breaks the shining scissors
You hurt me
I hurt her and she goes and you don't miss her
