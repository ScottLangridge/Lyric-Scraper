(John Jarvis, Eric Kaz)
I know you've run out of time for a fool like me.
It's all over now, you can't disguise,
All these constant good-byes.
I can't see, but I close my eyes and I walk away.
And try not to hear the words you say,
But I can't seem to turn my heart away.
There's a feeling out tonight, you're beside me everywhere.
Anyone would say, "It's over," but I just don't seem to care,
'Cause I could never turn my heart away,
I just can't seem to turn my heart away.
I can hear the music play, well I'm the only one who knows.
Maybe I'm a fool for listenin', but it takes me where it goes,

'Cause I can never turn my heart away,
I just can't seem to turn my heart away.
Something inside me needs to know
I can live to love again.
What is now has always been.
I need to let you know.
But I just can't turn away, and I can't stop loving you.
I can feel the end is near, but I can't admit it's true,
'Cause I could never turn my heart away,
I just can't seem to turn my heart away.
You go... I'll stay,
'Cause I just can't seem to turn my heart away.
