You've come Up In The World,
And it's all to your credit.
You made something of your life
Like you always said you would.
But what ever happened to the girl
I used to know and all those halcyon days of love?
You've come Up In The World,

And it's such a shame.
You made success of a dream,
But it seems so empty now
With your weak excuses and your
Condescending ways and
Your all-too-frequent nights alone.
