Mary Mac, all dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her back
I know, 'cause I love her so
She broke a needle now she can't sew

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ask my mama for fifteen cent
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high, it touched the sky
Didn't come back till the fourth of July

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk your dog

Mary Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow
Well well, silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
