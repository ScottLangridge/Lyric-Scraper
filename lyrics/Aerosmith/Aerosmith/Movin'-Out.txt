We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live ain't a soul around
People start a-comin'
All we do is just a-grin
Said we gotta move out
'Cause the city's movin' in
I said we gotta move out
'Cause the city's movin' in

Tell me who you know
And I'll tell you who, too
Go see my friend and he'll set you free
Tell me what you need and
Mabye I can go too
No one knows the way but maybe me

Nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me, yeah

Good mornin' glory, Hallelujah to ya
What is the story, what's been goin' through ya
Livin' like a king of the fat of the land
Workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band

We're movin', we're gettin' out
We're movin', without a doubt
We're movin', we're goin' far
We're movin', oh yes we are

Nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me
Nobody knows there
Nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me...

Level with God
And you're in tune with the universe
Talk with yourself
And you'll hear what you wanna know
Gotta rise above
'Cause below it's only gettin' worse
Life in time
Will take you where you wanna go

Where you wanna go, where you wanna go
Where you goin'
Where you goin'
Where you goin'
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah

Good mornin' glory, Hallelujah to ya
What is the story, what's been goin' through ya
Livin' like a king of the fat of the land
Workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band

We're movin', we're gettin' out
We're movin', without a doubt
We're movin', we're goin' far
We're movin', oh yes we are

Nobody knows there
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me
Nobody knows there
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes there you can't find me
Round n' round...

We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live ain't a soul around
People start a-comin'
All we do is just a-grin
We gotta move out
'Cause the city's movin' in
I said we gotta move out
'Cause the city's movin' in
