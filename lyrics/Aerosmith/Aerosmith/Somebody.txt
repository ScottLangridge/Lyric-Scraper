I need a lady, not somebody shady
Need someone to be close to
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosey
Help me see my whole day through

Someone to share the load
Somebody to walk the road I live on, live

Good Lord send me, good Lord mend me
Send me down someone for me
Said I won't be choosy
You could send me a floosy
Send me anybody you please
Somebody say you will
Somebody further still
Somebody, some, Somebody for me
Now won't you send me Somebody
Yeah, Somebody

Won't you send me Somebody
Now won't you send me Somebody
Well, call for Somebody
Scream loud and bloody
Call woman, woman, come on to me
Save for tomorrow
Share all your sorrow
Misery enjoys company
Yes it does, yes it does
