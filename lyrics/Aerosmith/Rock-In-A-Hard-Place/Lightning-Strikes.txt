Boys, it looks, are ready to rumble
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble
Blades gonna flash when streets gang clash
In the avenue tonight

When the Lightning Strikes

Zip gun Johnnys finger is itchin'
The lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen
It's an eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
It's so ruthless when they fight

When the Lightning Strikes

And it's free for all in the parking lot
And who'll rule the Street
And the night explodes
When the cops bring down the heat

And the chains they crash like thunder
While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights

When the Lightning Strikes

It's dog eat dog when you meet your rival
And the combat zone it's your means of survival
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz
With a broken dagger knife
When the Lightning Strikes

And it's free for all in the parking lot
And who'll rule the Street
And the night explodes
When the cops bring down the heat

And the chains they crash like thunder
While the weak ones all retreat
Gotta draw first blood
Or they'll read your funeral rights

Oh, oh...

When the Lightning Strikes
When the Lightning Strikes
When the Lightning Strikes
Lightning and thunder
When the Lightning Strikes...
