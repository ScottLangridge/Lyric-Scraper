You breathe I breathe you in
I like a lot where you've been
I maka you break the rules
You got me rockin the blues

Give a little bit get a little bit take it for a ride
When you push love so far away it eats you up inside
There's a girl living under my skin
There's this girl & she's wearing me thin
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season
There's a girl there's a girl

I know you know you are.......
You are the oh in la la
Blow a little kiss get a little bit get a little high yeah yeah
And I can't get you out of me cause your too deep inside

There's a girl living under my skin
There's this girl & she's wearing me thin
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season

You could spend your whole life trying
You could never be more mine

There's a girl there's a girl
There's a girl there's a girl

Get a little bit get a little bit get little high yeah
When you push love so far away it eats you up inside

There's a girl living under my skin
There's this girl & she's wearing me thin
And I think she's the reason
That it's open broken hearted season
There's a girl there's a girl yeah yeah yeah
There's
