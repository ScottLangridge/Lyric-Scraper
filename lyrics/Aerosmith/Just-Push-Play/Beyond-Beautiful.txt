You gave up the love you got & that is fact
She loves me now she loves you not and that where it's at
Cause when you thought your love was deep
Finders keepers losers weep yeah
Love my love my love du jour she's mine all mine
My minds made up ya I'm so sure because there's none so fine
The thing you found your losing sleep it's all about the love you keep

Yeah she's beyond beautiful
Yeah she'll never be nobody's fool that you'll be stuck with
Yeah it's all about me & you
Believe or not this love that we've got
Is beyond beautiful

Full of lust
Full of love
Without no clue
And though I was the one sure of
And then came you
Into my life it served me right
Nobody ever did it quite like you

Yeah she's beyond beautiful
Yeah she'll never be nobody's fool that you'll be stuck with
Yeah it's all about me & you
Believe or not this love that we've got
Is beyond beautiful

(Guitar solo)

Yeah she's beyond beautiful
Yeah she'll never be nobody's fool that you can fuck with
Yeah it's all about me & you
Believe or not this love that we've got
Is beyond beautiful
