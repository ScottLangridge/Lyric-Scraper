Hey
J-J-J-Jaded
You've got your mama's style but you're yesterday's child to me
So Jaded
You think that's where it's at but is that where it's supposed to be?
You're gettin' it all over me
X-rated

Chorus
My, my, baby blue
(Yeah I'm thinkin' 'bout you)
My, my, baby blue
Yeah, you're so Jaded
And I'm the one that Jaded you

Hey
J-J-J-Jaded
In all it's misery it will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side we're thinkin' of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be Jaded

Chorus
(w/) Yeah, I'm so Jaded
And baby I'm afraid of you

Bridge
You're thinkin' so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hate it
Wouldn't trade it
Love Me Jaded

Guitar solo

Hey
J-J-J-Jaded
There ain't no "baby please" when I'm shootin' the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

Chorus

(w/) (Blue, blue, blue, Yeah)
(I'm talkin' 'bout you)
(Blue, blue, blue, blue Yeah)
(Yeah, been thinkin' 'bout you)
My, my, baby blue
Yeah, you're so Jaded (Baby)
Jaded (Baby)
You're so Jaded
'Cause I'm the one that Jaded you
