Oh when you cross that line
That you know you can't erase,
To fall in lust not love
Ain't no sin at all
And tell me when you're with
You're best friends friend
Do you still feel out of place?
No thanks I took that ride
God only knows I've tried believin'

I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart
And hope to die
To tell I love you lies

I imagine everyone survives,
For giving up all that you got
To tell I love you lies

The first time you look for love
You find you don't know jack
Yeah
So much for mind games
You play to win
Cuz first you lose your heart's desire
Then you get it back
But ignorance ain't bliss
There's so much more behind the kiss
I'm feelin'

I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart
And hope to die
To tell I love you lies

I imagine everyone survives,
Forgiving up all that you got
To tell I love you lies

When loneliness and paranoia feeds me
God help the person who needs me
If ignorance is bliss
Take me off the list
I'm leaving

I imagine everyone sometimes
Will cross their heart
And hope to die
To tell I love you lies

I imagine everyone survives
For giving up all that you got
To tell I love you lies
