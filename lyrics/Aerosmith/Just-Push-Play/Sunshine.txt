I sold my soul for a one night stand
I followed Alice into wonder land
I ate the mushroom and I dance with the queen
Yeah we dancing in between all the lines

I followed daylight right into the dark
Took to the hatter like a walk in the park
But then I met her yeah she felt so right
No shadow the night yeah it was she

They call her sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah yeah
Sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah
Sunshine
Yeah

Her kind of love is what I adore
What kind of trouble am I in for
My kind of heaven lies in hells back door
And I got more than I need

Cause I need sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah yeah
My sunshine she's finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah sunshine yeah

I got the karma but it don't come free
I chased that rabbit up her bodi tree
That caterpillar's tryin to cop a plea
But the smoke ain't got nothing on me

I got to have my sunshine
The kind that everybody knows
Yeah yeah
My Sunshine
She's finer than a painted rose

Sunshine the kind that everybody knows
My sunshine she's finer than a painted rose
Yeah yeah
Sunshine
Sunshine yeah
