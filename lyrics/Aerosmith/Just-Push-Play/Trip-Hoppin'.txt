I got a wild thing for you
We're talking hoops you got me jumpin' through
You got those lemon drop martini eyes
And if my karma suits you, cross the line into another place & time

Tell me how pretty she is when she turns the colors of the rainbow
One more day with you Trip Hoppin
One more night with you no stoppin
Ain't no smokin' fantasy cause love you is trippin' to me

You got me psychodelisized, you got my situation bone-a-fide
It took a sunset to get me to see
That all I really needed was your love to yeah forever shine on me
Promise promiscuities is like waiting for your ex-to-see

That one more day with you trip hoppin' yeah
One more night with you no stoppin'
Get my way with you trip hoppin'
In my kaliediscope I'm looking through, my only color was a neon blue
I was hangin' on to yesterday and now the only way out is through
One more night with you, one more day won't do

How beyond the rainbow is my laying on your emrald pillow

One more day with you trip hoppin
One more night with you no stoppin
Ain't no smoking fantasy cause love you is trippin' to me
One more day with you trip hoppin'
One more night with you no stoppin'
Get my way with you trip hoppin'
One more day with you trip hoppin'
