Totally out of control She owns me
I didn't know that she'd know She stoned me
I think I got it bad and I can't let it go
I thought I knew me much better

Autum and cashmere all orange & green
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Creme de Gardenia and Black Vaseline
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Its so not fair

Completely inside my head imagine pretending
She's the book that I've read with a beautiful ending
It really drives me mad I can't leave her alone
Cause I wont let me forget her

Rose colored glasses you know what that says
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Her sweet molasses on my pasque frez
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous

Totally out of control She owned me

Sweet almond eyes just to see & be seen
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
She tasted like cherries sweet loves grenadine
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
Makes love like a rabbit to my velveteen
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
A ten with a smile like a young Norma Jean
She's naturally drop dead gorgeous
