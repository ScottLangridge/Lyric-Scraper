She gave you a flower, the one that God gave her
You all up in the kool-aid but you do not know the flavor
Get into the zone baby and do yourself a favor
Head down spin around get a little refried
If that don't get it you can catch it on the b-side

Just push play
All the way
Just push play
We're gonna do it anyway
Just push play
Right away
Just push play
We're comin at you anyway

Sweet leaf dreamer you been smoking up the ganja
Damned if you do yeah but don't get any on ya
Kickin off the cashmere putting on the kasbah
It's a kiss a diss and trade it for a coo hah

Just push play
All the way
Just push play
We're gonna do it anyway
Just push play
Right Away
Just push play
We're comin at you anyway

Instead of growin old all dapper and neat
I'm gonna grow my hair right down to my feet
It's you and me baby no pimp daddy jack
It's Cadillac wack no Cadillac wack back

Just push play

Just push play
We're gonna do it anyway
Just push play
Your away
Just push play
Everybody got to say

So dj
You got to play it anyway
Walk this way
We're comin at you anyway

Just push play
All the way
Just push play
We're gonna do it anyway
S'l vous plait
Right away
Just push play
We're gonna do it anyway
Just Push Play
We're comin' at you anyway
We're comin at you anyway

Tell them what I say
Walk this way
All the way
We're comin at you anyway
