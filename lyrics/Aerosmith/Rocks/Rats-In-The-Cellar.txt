Goin' under, Rats In The Cellar
Goin' under, skin's turnin' yellow
Nose is runny, losin' my connection
Losin' money, getting no affection

New York City blues
East side, West side lose
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart

Safe complaining, 'cause everything's rotten
Go insanin', and ain't a thing forgotten
Feelin' cozy, Rats In The Cellar
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow
Loose and soggy, lookin' mighty lazy
Super party, pushin up a-daisies

New York City schools
East side, west side lose
Throw me in the slam
Catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart
