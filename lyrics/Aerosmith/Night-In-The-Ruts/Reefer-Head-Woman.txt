I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky (good Lord)
I got a reefer headed woman
She fell right down from the sky

Well, I gots to drink me two fifths of whiskey
Just to get half as high

When the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town
Oh, when the good Lord made that woman
He sure went to town

Well, when he was feelin' high
Oh, he sure should have been feelin' low

Mr. Perry!
