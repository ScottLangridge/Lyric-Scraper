In the attic lights
Voices scream
Nothing's seen
Real's a dream

Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years

Voices scream
Nothing's seen
Real's a dream

[Chorus:]
Toys, toys, Toys In The Attic
Toys, toys, Toys In The Attic
Toys, toys, Toys In The Attic
Toys, toys, Toys In The Attic

Lights
Voices scream
Nothing's seen
Real's a dream

Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years

Voices scream
Nothing's seen
Real's a dream

(Repeat Chorus) (yayayayayayayow!)
