You See Me Crying
Don't let it get you down
You See Me Crying
I'm back to the lost and found

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said

You See Me Crying
Say you're a ladies man
You See Me Crying
So hard to understand

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said

You See Me Crying
Please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover, honey
Let me take ya to town
And I'll show you everything around
And I'll never ever let you down
'Cause my love is like a merry-go-round
