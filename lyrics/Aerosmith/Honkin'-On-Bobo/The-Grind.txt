I never thought a first time love would ever last
How could a kiss like that, knock me flat on my ass

Hey ha...

The burning bed
The roses dead
And now I'm dancing with myself

Yeah, I'm missing you
Just like you want me too
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get you off of my mind

Your sweet talkin' hip shakin' walkin' gonna blow a man away
Kiss butt, guess what even double crossin' dogs have their day, ha
So forget about, regret about, you're right I ain't afraid to say

Yeah, I'm missing you
Just like you want me to
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get you off

And the more I tried
Leads to the same old lie
You made me slip into the grind
Now I can't get you off of the cloud we was on
And now it's all gone
Tell me why, why, why, why
Why ain't I getting through
Ain't no lie their out of love, love, love

Tell me was it good, for you
Tell me what you want

Yeah, 'cause I'm missing you
Just like you know I do
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can'y get you off,
And you know I tried
Leads to the same old why
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't, can't, can't get you
Get you
Get you
Get you
Get you
Get you
Get you
Get you

Off of my mind...
