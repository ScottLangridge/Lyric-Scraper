You were talkin' bout'chor woman
I wish to God honey... That'choo could see mine
Every time that little girl start to loving... She bring eyesight to the blind

Lord... Her daddy musta been a millionaire... 'cause I can tell by the way she walk
Her daddy musta been a millionaire... 'cause I can tell by the way she walk
Every time she start loving... The deaf and dumb begin to talk
Yeah... You know what they say

I remember one Friday morning
We was lying down across your bed
Man in the bathroom was dying... Eyes were sad and I stroked his head
And I said... Lordy... Ain't she pertty... And the whole state knows she's fine... Yeah

And every every every time she start to loving... She bring eyesight to the blind

What a woman I got here
Lean on me baby... Lean on me
Oh...

Yes... I declare she pretty and the whole state knows she's fine
Man... I declare she pretty... Lordy Lordy I declare she's fine
Every every every every time she starts to loving... She bring eyesight to the blind
