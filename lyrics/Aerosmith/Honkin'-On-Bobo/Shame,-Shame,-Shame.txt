. Lyrics-Ruby Fisher  Music-Kenyon Hopkins

You made me sweat'n toil til I was skin'n bone
It wasn't love but greed - Look at me now!
Shame, Shame, Shame On You, Miss Roxy1 Shame, Shame, Shame on what you done!

Well I was off the dice, I didn't touch the gin
An' then the dam broke loose - you were the reason! (Shame, shame, shame, etc.)

Just let a stranger pass, you had to toss your head
You had to shake your hips - flash him the come-on! (Shame, shame, shame, etc)

Why is the furnace cold? Why is the pantry bare?
Why does the roof still leak? You drove your man out!(Shame, shame, shame, etc.)

An' now you want me back?  Well I can tell you plain
You're gonna heed my word. Down on your knees girl!(Shame, Shame, Shame, etc.)
