Ohh... Cayeah...

What'cha say baby...
Umm huh...
That's what I thought...

You're a no good heartbreaker
You're a liar... You're a cheat
And I don't know why I let you do them things to me
My friends keep telling me... Yeah... That'choo ain't no good
Oh why... I'd leave you if I could
I guess I'm on tight
And I'm stuck like glue
Cause I ain't never
I ain't never
I ain't never... No... No...
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you

Sometimes I know I thought
You would run outta fools
But I was so wrong
Ya got the one you'll never lose
The way you treat me is shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Woh... Ooo... Oohh... Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't'choo never never say that we're through
Cause I ain't never
Never
Never... No... No...
Loved a girl the way that I
I love you... Yeah

I can't sleep at night... And I can't eat a bite
And I guess I'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me

Oh oh I.... Yeah

I ain't never loved a woman like I love ya
I ain't never loved a girl
I ain't never loved a woman like I put my arm aroun' ya
Yeah never loved a girl
