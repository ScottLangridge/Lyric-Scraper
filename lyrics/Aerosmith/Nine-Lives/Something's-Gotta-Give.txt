(Chu, chu...)

Cyberotic head explode
Information overload
And I just can't take anymore
And I'm gonna break

(Chorus)
Something's gotta give
(Give it away to take the screw
Does the noise in my head bother you)
Something's gotta give
(Don't you like to help me thru (?)
Does the noise in my head bother you)

Digerotic mass appeal
Feels like flesh but tastes unreal
And I'm gonna break

(Chorus)

If love that seemed to fall from grace
Sitting on your interface
Your megahertz she can't forgive
Your love it died before you ever lived

(Chorus)
