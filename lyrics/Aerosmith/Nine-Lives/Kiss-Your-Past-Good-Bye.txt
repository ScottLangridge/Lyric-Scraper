Finders keepers losers weep
Down on 42nd Street
Oh, bare-foot children cryin' my, oh, my
I watched you on the avenue
While other men were having you
I think that you should let your caged bird fly

And Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye, yeah
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye

I've been so lost I must confess
I've had my share of loneliness
But yeah, it's hard to keep a good man down
The loves you lost were all in vain
The past lives on inside your brain
I don't think you need those memories hangin round
Yeah

Good-bye
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
You gotta let it fly
And Kiss Your Past Good-Bye

(Oh, Kiss Your Past Good-Bye)

And if that bird don't fly away
There's just one thing I got to say

It's later than a deuce of ticks
Your broken heart, it needs a fix
You're feedin' off a high that would not last
And people they don't seem to care
And sorry just don't cut it, yeah
It seems to me you're gettin' nowhere fast

So Kiss... Your... Past
Or kiss your ass good-bye
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
It's no marks if you cry
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
Kiss Your Past Good-Bye
Or kiss your ass good-bye
Yeah
