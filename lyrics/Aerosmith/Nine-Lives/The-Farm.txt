(It's not a place you can get to
By a boat or a train...it's far, far away...

(Words from Wizard of Oz)

Oaahh!

There's a cockroach in my coffee
There's a needle in my arm
And I feel like New York City
Get me to the farm

(Chorus)
Get me to the farm
Get me to the farm
Get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

I got terminal uniqueness
I'm an egocentric man
I get caught up in my freakness
But I ain't no Peter Pan
Get me to the farm

Get me to the farm
Get me to the farm
Get me to the farm
Get me...

Buckle up straightjack
Insanity is such a drag
Jellybean thorazene
Transcendental jet lag
Sanity I ain't gona
Feeling like a pifiata
Sucker punch, blow lunch
Motherload, pigeonhole
I'm feeling like I'm gonna explode

Yeah, I wanna shave my head and
I wanna be a Hare Krishna
Tattoo a dot right on my head
Heh, heh
And the prozac is my fixer
I am the living dead

(Follow the yellow brick road...
Follow the yellow brick road...)

Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm
Somebody take me to the farm

Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Somebody take me to the farm
Somebody take me to the farm

Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm

(Repeat last verse)

Take me to the farm
Take me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

(Wake up, honey...Then I'm sure to
Get a brain, a heart, a home, the nerve)
