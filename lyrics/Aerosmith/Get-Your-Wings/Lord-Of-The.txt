Down to who knows who just to socialize
I'm waitin' for my girls, when you caught my eyes
You got your ways to make a man
Honey, you got to understand
I'm your man, child, Lord Of The Thighs

Well, well, Lordie my God
What do we got here
She's flashin' 'cross the floor
Make it perfectly clear
You're the bait and you're the hook
Someone bound to take a look
I'm your man, child, Lord Of The Thighs

You must have come here to find me
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the Lord Of The Thighs

You must have come here to find me
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the Lord Of The Thighs
