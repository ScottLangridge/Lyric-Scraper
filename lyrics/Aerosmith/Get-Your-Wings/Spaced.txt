Spaced in time, child of mine
Doin' twenty years on the way
Fire and steel, earth unreal
Find another planet to stay
Papa died, ma survived
Tellin' me about her ordeal

And the soul she could not feel
'Cause they made her so unreal

Lightnin' years disappearsne
Twenty million years on my brain
Synthesize, overrides
Tryin' to keep from goin' insane

And my soul I can not feel
'Cause they made me so unreal

Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothing out there
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losin' my mind

And I'm never ever goin' back
I lost the track
No one even knows I'm alive
Spaced without a trace
Waitin' for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive
