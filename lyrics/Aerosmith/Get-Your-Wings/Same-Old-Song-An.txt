Get yourself cooler
Lay yourself low
Coincidental murder
With nothing to show
When the judge's constipation
Goes to his head
And his wife's aggravation
You're soon enough dead

It's the same old story
Same Old Song And Dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same Old Song And Dance, my friend

Got you with the cocaine
They found with your gun
No smooth face laywer
To get ya undone
Say love ain't the same
On the south side of town
You could look
But you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same Old Song And Dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story
Same Old Song And Dance

Fate comes a-knockin'
Doors start lockin'
Your old time connection
Change your direction
Ain't gonna change it
Can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain
When it's all the same to you, my friend

When you're low down and dirty
From walkin' the street
With your old hurdy gurdy
No one to meet
Said love ain't the same
On the south side of town
You could look
But you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same Old Song And Dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story
Same Old Song And Dance
