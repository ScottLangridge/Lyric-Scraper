Checkmate honey
Beat you at your own damn game
No dice honey
I'm livin' on the astral plane
Feet's on the ground
Your head's going down the drain
Heads I win, tails you lose
To the never mind

When you Draw The Line

Indian summer
Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet net winner
And rarely ever left the store
She sang and danced all night
And wronged all the right out of me
Pass me the vile and cross your fingers
It don't take time

Nowhere to Draw The Line

"High Ho Silver" we were singin' all the cowboy songs
You told Carrie
You promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose
Lord it's such a crime
No dice honey
You the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey
You're the only one who's got to choose

Where they Draw The Line

Checkmate, don't be late
Take another blow
That's right
It's possible to wreck it
Cuz' you kill yourself
When you rock to the top
Your the boss of yourself
So suffer
Now Draw The Line
Ooo-Yeah

(Repeat)
