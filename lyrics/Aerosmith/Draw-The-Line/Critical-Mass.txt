Arriving in boats
Black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed
Covered my head
But they're flushin' me out with a broom
The leades, she's small
Pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time
She'd be readin' my mind

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate it
This is Critcal Mass

So far, so good
I heard the other say
So good, so far
They're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrake it
This is Critical Mass

Now the tallest of two
With a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun
That it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart
Tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practise and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screamin' out down the hall

Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the wall
We're all there, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to your alas
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the Critical Mass
Time and space is takin' me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day
