It's the dawn of the day
And I'm crashed and I'm smashed
And it is I'm feelin'
Like my chips are cashed
All of my clothes
Strewn all over the room
The crisis at hand is
I'm all out of zoom

(Chorus)
I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV
Is the Good Morning News

The tricks of the night
Keepin' me in a daze
Open a bottle
And I'll pull down the shades
Glance in the mirror
Back into bed
Forget that it's day
Time to party again

(Chrous)

Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Bright Light Fright
Give me the night

(Repeat)

(Repeat Chorus)
