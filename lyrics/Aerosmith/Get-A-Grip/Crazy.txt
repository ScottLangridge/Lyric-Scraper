Come 'ere baby

You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good for all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you've got someone on your mind
Other than me
Girl, you gotta change your crazy ways - you hear me

Say you're leavin' on the seven thirty train
And that you're heading out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets that feelin' bad looks good, yeah

That kinda lovin' turns a man to a slave
That kinda lovin' sends a man right to his grave

[Chorus:]
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on - then you're gone
Yeah you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packin' up your stuff
And and talkin' like it's tough
And tryin' to tell me
That it's time to go, yeah!
But I know you ain't wearin' nothin' underneath that
Overcoat and that it's all a show, yeah!

That kinda lovin' makes me wanna pull down the shade, yeah
That kinda lovin' yeah, now I'm never never never never gonna be the same

[Chorus:]

I'm losing my mind
Girl, 'cause I'm goin' crazy

I need your love, honey, yeah
I need your love...

Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
I'm losin' my mind,
Girl cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, baby I go crazy
You turn it on - then you're gone
Yea you drive me...

Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
I'm losing my mind
Gril, cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
I'm losing my mind
Girl, cause I'm going crazy

Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on - then you're gone
Yeah! You drive me...
