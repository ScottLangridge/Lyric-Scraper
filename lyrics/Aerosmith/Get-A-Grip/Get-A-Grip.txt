(Chorus)
Got to Get A Grip
Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
If you think I'm vain, better shut ya lip
I can't explain how to be a fat city
You gotta live large, gotta let it rip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta Get A Grip - rip

Once upon a crime I thought I was cool
But I don't want to brag
Once I crossed the line I think I musta
Zigged when I shoulda zagged

Chorus

Same old, same old every day
If things don't change you're just gonna rot
'Cause if you do what you've always done
You've always get what you've always got
(Uuh, could that be nothing)

Chorus

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta Get A Grip

Who knows for sure without a doubt
What goes on when the lights go out
Or who pulls in when I pull out
And what is a one-eyed trouser trout

I was so shortsighted
Now the wrong been righted
I feel so delighted
I get so excited

Chorus

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta Get A Grip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta Get A Grip

You wanna get high in a New York minute
Choke that smoke, honey crack the whip
Your head gets dead as long as you're in it
You wanna hang loose, gotta Get A Grip

Skin and bones, it ain't such a pity
Don't ya gimme no flack, honey shut ya lip
Ya gotta have stones if you're livin' in the city
If ya wanna hang loose, gotta Get A Grip
