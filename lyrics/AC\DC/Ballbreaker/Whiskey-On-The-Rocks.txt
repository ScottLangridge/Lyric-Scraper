I've been drinkin' all night long
So long baby, I'm gone
[Oh yeah]
[Well] Bloody Mary give me shivers from a shot
Set up the shooters it's time for a drop
[Give me] Old Jamaica, runnin' we come
Down at the hatch Jack, the women and the fun
We drink a lot, That demon drop
This one's on me and here's to you
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixer from the top
[You were] Drinkin' Mai Tais, Singapore sling
Beam me up Jim, it's time to come in
I'll have one more afore ye close up the door
It's on the house mac, it's whiskey galore
We drink a lot, that demon drop
This one's on me, here's mud in your eye
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixer from the top
[Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on
Let's throw seven sheets to the wind - hahaha
Fill 'em up too!]
I'm drinkin'
Whiskey on the rocks
[A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
I'm drinkin'
Whiskey on the rocks
I'll have a whiskey on the rocks
Give me whiskey on the rocks
Keep it comin' on the rocks ]
[Yeah] Pour me a double here comes trouble on the rocks
Whiskey on the rocks
