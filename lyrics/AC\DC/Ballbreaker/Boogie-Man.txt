Some people say, I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks, might of got it right
And some people say I drive a cadillac car
Or sell my wares hauntin' hotel bars
I'm the boogie man, [yeah] the boogie man
[Yeah, yeah, yeah]
I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talkin' s** to women, girls in fast cars
I might be under the bed, ready to bite
So little girl becareful, when you're on your own tonight
['Cause] I'm you're boogie man, you're boogie man
And I hope, that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man
[Oh, I'm your boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Yes I'm your boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Yow, here we go
And I hope, that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man]
And don't let the sun, come up on me
Your boogie man
I'm your boogie man, your boogie man
[I'm your boogie man, your boogie man
I'm your boogie man, your boogie man
Boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Yeah yeah
I'm your boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man]
