A Rollin' rock, Electric shock
She gives a lickin' that doesn't stop [That don't stop]
She line 'em up, Push you 'round
Smokin' rings going round and round
Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standing proud
Chorus:
Hard as a rock                        [I'm hard as a rock]
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock                    [Well it's harder than a rock]
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock                    [Well it's harder than a rock]
The lightnin' rod, Strike it hot
Gonna hit you like a Rushmore rock    [It's gonna hit you like a Rushmore rock]
No nicotine, and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty it's darn right mean
Hell elevator
I'll see you later                    [Yeah, sooner or later]
No I ain't gonna take it
I'm busting out                       [Listen, I'm busting out]
Chorus
Yea
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yea
I'm getting harder
Yeah
Yeeeeeeeeaahh!
Harder than a rock
Well I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Baby I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah it's harder than a rock
Yeah
Hard as a rock
Well I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yes I'm harder, harder, harder, harder than a rock.
