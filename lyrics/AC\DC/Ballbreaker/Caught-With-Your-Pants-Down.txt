Runnin' 'round with the wrong crowd
Goin' out on a last stand
Playin' too hard and too loud
Bad cards in a bad hand
Wanna dance, wanna sing
Whip you with that lickin' thing
Tonight I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
And maybe I'll get beat up
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Lining up for a roll call
Goin' out with a big bang
Gettin' caught in a shootout
Take it hard like a big man
Woman workin' so hot
Givin' it everything you've got
Just like it's never gonna stop
[Ooh] Tonight I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
And maybe I'll get beat up
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
[Yeah, yeah, yeah]
She take 'em down down down
[Ooh] She rip off her stockin's when the place started rockin'
Down down down
She was a woman with a mission stick it in your face
Caught with your pants down
Down down down down down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
[Caught with your pants down
Yeah
Rockin' with your pants down
Caught me with my pants down
I'm happy with my pants down
Caught you with your pants down
Everybody caught you with your pants down
Sneakin' in the alley with your pants down
Bustin' in the room [?] with your pants down
Ah (x17)
Yeeeeeeeeeeeah, yeah ]
