Honey roll over, and lettuce on top
Strap you to the bed, and make you rock
Run it up the flag, send it on home
Push you to the wall, and make you moan
She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
[So] Don't you hide, gonna blow my mind
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine
She turn it on, Upside down
She turn me on, Inside out
She turn it on, all around
She turn me on, She turn it on
Baby bend over, touch your toes               [Honey bend over]
She take over, the bomb explodes
A rockin' rollercoaster, flyin' off the top
Take you high diving, off the long drop
[Yeah]
She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, Gonna blow my mind            [I wanna blow my mind]
C'mon taste it honey cause she feel fine
She turn it on, Upside down
She turn me on, Inside out
She turn it on, all around
She turn me on, She turn it on

She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, gonna blow my mind
