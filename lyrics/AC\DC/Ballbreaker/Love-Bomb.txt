Love bomb, love bomber
It's a comin' on strong
I can't take it any longer
Come a rockin' through the door
Crusin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' on down and die
Open your bays, get ready, it's bomb's away!
Love bomb, love bomber
Don't scare no bother
Where the size doesn't matter
Come long, short or badder
Crusin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' on down and die
Open your bays and drop those bombs away!
Love bomb, comin' on,
Love bomb
Love bomb, get it hard
Love bomb
[Love bomb, get it on
Love bomb, gimme some
Love bomb, get it hot
Love bomb, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love bomb, comin' on
Love bomb, give me some
Love bomb, get it hot
Love bomb, yeah
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
