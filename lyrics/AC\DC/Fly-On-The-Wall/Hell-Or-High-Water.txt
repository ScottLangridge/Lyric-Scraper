Everybody, you don't have to choose
You don't have to prove it
It's only rock 'n' roll
Mama don' told me
Papa don' scold me
Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you snake on me
Mama don' told me
Daddy don' scold me, told me, show me
You know that he (sold? Saw?) me
Chorus:
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Blood money, lyin' through your back teeth
Fightin' on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me
Mama don' told me
Poor boy get home
Hot lovin' trigger-happy feelin'
Touchin' up and teasin'
You know it so bad
Mama don' told me
Papa don' scold me, told me, show me, rock 'n' rolled me
Repeat chorus (twice)
Come hell, come hell, come hell
