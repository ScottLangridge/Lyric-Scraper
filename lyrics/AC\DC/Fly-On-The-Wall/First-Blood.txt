Got a screamin' feelin'
Need a little lovin' healin'
Want some of that stuff
'Cos I like a hot touch
Wanna little squeezin'
Just a touch an' teasin'
Maybe wrong, maybe right
But I like it every night
Come on baby down my way
We gonna make it night an day
CHORUS:
I want first blood (a look in the eye)
First blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come back for more
First blood, first blood
Some like it hot
Some like it quite not so hot
But I like a touch
And I want it so much
Come on baby down my way
We're gonna make it every night an day
REPEAT CHORUS (twice)
I want a first blood
Some like it hot
First blood all right hot shot
Bad dog come back for more
I want first blood
