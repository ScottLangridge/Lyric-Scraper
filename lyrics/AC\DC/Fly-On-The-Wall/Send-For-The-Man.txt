You want love
Dirty dirty love
You want lust
Just a little lust
You wan' a bad reputation
You wanna better your score
I got the qualifications
I can open any door (ooh yeah)
Chorus:
Send for the man, yeah
Send for teh man, yeah
You're like a dream
You're dirty low and mean
You're good enough to eat
Sticky hot and sweet
Need a shot of rhythm and lovin'
You make a black sheep a ram
This ain't a gun in my pocket
I got the goods in my hand
Repeat chorus
