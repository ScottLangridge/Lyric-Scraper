Highball women that are hot to touch
Legs do the talkin' spellin' out lust
See the Sugar Daddies with a sweet tooth and a smile
See what's hangin' off him like a want'n child
That's where you'll find me standing proud
Chorus:
Playing with girls gonna get you hot
Playing with guns gonna get you shot
Playing with fire gonna heat you up
Playing with me you're gonna get the lot
Bring on the showgirls and the debutantes
Late-night waitress in a restaurant
Headin' for the clubs and bars with the flashin' lights
Lookin' for the good-time girls in their black nylon tights
Over the barrel bottoms-up
Repeat chorus
Oooh river run dry
Yeah playing with fire
Oooh wild sweet child
Playing with girls
Playing with girls
I like a tall girl, but I'll take 'em small
I want 'em all up front I like 'em all
I wanna see 'em strut their stuff
Lose their social grace
You play your cards right and you'll deal yourself an ace
That's where you'll find me standing proud
Playing with girls
