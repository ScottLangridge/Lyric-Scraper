Breakin' out, about to shout
Feel the need for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
You want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wreckin' ball, I'm a stingin' knife
Steal your money, gonna take your life
You got screamin' murder, lock up your door
Double dealin' gotta have more
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell (the? My?) boys that I'm gonna be
Chorus:
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
Back in business again
(Back in business)
Flesh and blood, I'm a rag 'n' bone
Bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favor, put your soul for sale
Like a cannon ball, goin' down the track
Need good lovin' but I want it back
I was born in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preachin' what not to be
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell my boys that I'm gonna be
Repeat chorus
Solo
Repeat chorus (twice)
