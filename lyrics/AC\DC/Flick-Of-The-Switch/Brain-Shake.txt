Alright, hold tight
I want to ball tonight
On my fender, no space defender
I enjoy it on the floor, I get it tight
Toe to toe with a black widow
Fee Fia Foo smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All night drive on the rockin' suicide
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, a joy to ride
She's an all night drive on the rockin' suicide
And it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
All I can take
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
She's a mean lean rocking machine
A hip hugging blue jean dream
She's a one course dinner, with a sweet sweet kiss
Her hips are right around me
And it's toe to toe with a black widow
Fee Fia Foo smell the blood of rock 'n' roll
All night drive on the rockin' suicide
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, a joy to ride
She's an all night drive on the rockin' suicide
And it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
Ready to shake
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
It's a brain shake brain shake brain shake
For mercy sake
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake
She's a joy to ride
Joy to ride, a joy to ride
She's an all night drive on the rockin' suicide
Brain shake x3
Ready to shake
Brain shake x3
