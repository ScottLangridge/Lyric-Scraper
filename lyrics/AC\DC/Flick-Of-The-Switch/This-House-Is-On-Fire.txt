Yonder she walked
Yonder she walked, hittin one of dream
A little tongue in cheek, hot poisonality
She bring on the flames, and it's burning and burning
My body's aching, tossing and turning
House is on fire
House is on fire
This house is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn you, you
She got me running for shelter
Needin' quarantine
She got me red hot and wired
Call an emergency
She bring on the flames, and it's burning and burning
My body's aching, tossing and turning
House is on fire
House is on fire
This house is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn you, you
You got me burning and burning
You got me tossing and turning
Burn, burn, burn
This house is on fire, House is on fire
This house is on fire, House is on fire
This house is on fire, This house is on fire
House is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn you,
The flame is gonna burn,
You're gonna burn you
