The blood in my veins
Was running right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was running around insane
Three fifty arrests
No bullet proof vest
Now ain't that a shame
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
Law said: "No way!"
"Cause you're on your way out"
Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
The place was a jumpin'
And the booze was going down
There's a curfew in town
You've been working overtime
We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack
In the back with his gun
I bled so bad
I could feel the blood run
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time
Left on the run.
Bedlam in Belgium
Who's to blame, it's a shame
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam
You gonna run out
Stage was stage
Cops enraged
Crying for more
It was war, war, war
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time
Left on the run.
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
There was bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam
And the law got the drop on me
