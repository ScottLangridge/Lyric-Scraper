I want you to hear me out there
This is for all you bad boys
This is a story of the satan rock 'n' roll
I want you to put your hands in your pocket
Take ten dollars out and send it to me, ha ha
You're the man, a main man                [Hallelujah, and amen]
Listen to me baby, I'm gonna say it again
When Momma done school her son
For what he didn't do 'round there
Daddy don't take a no, no, no
Sends him to a (bullet affair?)
This boy is lost
It's a living nightmare
It ain't fair
Chorus:
That boy he don't know how to lose
He's out to win
He got the lot to call the last shot
Shaker, he's a breaker, he's a maker
He's a landslide, landslide
Walking, talking, rocking landslide
Now Momma he ain't no toy
And never ever gets his share
(Daddy expecting to???? His son?)
???? Room for air
This boy is lost
It's a rocking double dare
He's out to stare
Chorus
Landslide
Landslide
Landslide
Landslide
(Preacher) done say his prayer
Take him to the promised land
Momma don't love, gonna give him hell
Never gonna get him down
This boy is lost
Like a river, follow the course
But he's the boss

Chorus
Landslide, walking talking rocking landslide
Landslide, Landslide
That man's a one man landslide
Landslide
Landslide
Landslide
That man's a one man landslide
That boy's a walk talk rocking landslide, he's gone
