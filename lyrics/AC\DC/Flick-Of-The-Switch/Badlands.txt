I am a pistol packin' man with a gun in my hand
Looking for a woman that will understand
You like to roll and I like to ride
I'll stop at nothing, never take me alive
I'm a man with a fast hand
Loving on a last stand
Outlaw, quick draw
Evil talking bandit man
In the badlands
In the badlands
I got A. 45 that'll make you fry
Burn your saucy ass up like the Fourth of July
I ride it hard, I ride it high
Make love to you till you reach for the sky
I'm a man with a fast hand
Loving on a last stand
Outlaw, quick draw
Evil talking bandit man
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
Well I'm gonna set up my six pack
Ain't gonna back track
I shoot loaded
Come on girl, gonna give you a thrill
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
In the badlands
Not for a woman                   [Lookin' for a woman ]
In the badlands
Look man, there's me              [As bad as me]
In the badlands
John [?] take it with me          [Gotta take it with ya | me]
In the badlands, yeah
