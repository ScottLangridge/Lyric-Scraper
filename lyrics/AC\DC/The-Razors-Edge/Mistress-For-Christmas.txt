Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the day
I just can't wait till Christmas time
When I can grope you in the hay          (When I can roll you in the hay)
Easy come, easy go
Have a good time with lots of dough
Slippin' up high, slippin' down low
Love'm and leave'm on with the show
Listen, I like female form in minimum dress
Money to spend with a capital "S"
Get a date with the woman in red
Wanna be in heaven with three in a bed   (One of me in heaven...)
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
But I want it, but it don't matter
She got it, and I can't [get | have] it
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress for Christmas
(Ooh yeah, haha yeah
I want a mistress for Christmas
Come on)
Easy come, easy go
Slippin' high, slippin' low
(Yeah, aw right)
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
I want it, don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it -
Mistress
He got it, I want it
For Christmas
They got it, and I can't have it
Mistress
But I want it, it don't matter
For Christmas
She got it, and I can't get a
Mistress for Christmas
You know what I'm talkin' about
Mistress for Christmas
You gotta send me down
You gotta send me down
Mistress for Christmas
I want the woman in red               (I want a woman in the rear,)
With bow in my bed                     with a bottle of my beer)
Mistress for Christmas
I can hear you coming down my smoke stack
I wanna ride on your raindeer honey and ring the bells
