(Come on now,
Come on, come on, yeah, ow!)
Come on honey, take a trip with me
We'll take a double shot of ectasy
I'll drink some water from a wooden cup
And keep a rockin' 'til the sun comes up

Chorus:
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
And I warn you
It's the best shot of your life
Shot of love
Shot of love
Rock you little lady make you blow and bleed
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Come on now honey we'll get full of desire
A humping and a bumping till we start a fire  (a huffin' and a puffin') ?
Chorus
(Shot of love - I'm gonna make you plead)
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, awright ooh hoo hoo baby oh baby)
chorus
Shot of Love
Like to plead?
Shot of love, Shot of love, Shot of love
A humping and pumping got you jumping
Shot of love, Shot of love, Shot of love
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed
Shot of love, Shot of love, Shot of love
Let me warn you, I'm coming for you
Shot of love, Shot of love, Shot of love
Shot of love, Shot of love
Come on give me shot of love
