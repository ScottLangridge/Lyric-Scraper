(Yeeeaaaah)

(Razors edge)
(Yeah)
(Razors)
There's fighting on the left, and marching on the right
Don't look up in the sky, you're gunna die of fright
Here, comes the razors edge

You're livin' on the edge, don't know wrong from right
They're breathin' down your neck; you're runnin' out of lives
And here comes the razors edge
Here comes the razors edge
The razors edge

(Razors edge) to raise the dead
(Razors edge) to cut to shreds

Here comes the razors edge
Here comes the razors edge

Well here it comes, to cut to shreds
The razors edge
It's the razors edge
Well the razors edge
You'll be cut to shreds
You're the razors edge
Well the razors edge
