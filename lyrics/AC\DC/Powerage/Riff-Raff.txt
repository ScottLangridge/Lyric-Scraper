Ya see it on television every day
Hear it on the radio
Ain't humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
The police tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh, ah ah ah
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half

Now I'm the kind of guy that keeps his big mouth shut
But don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leaves me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
I'm just havin' fun

Riff raff
Well it's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half

Do it again
