They say that you play too loud,
Well, baby, that's tough!
They say that you got to much,
Can't get enough!
They tell you that you look the fool,
And, baby, I'm a fool for you!
They say that your mind's diseased,
Shake your stuff!

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation!
Ma's own whippin' boy!
Rock 'n' roll damnation!
Take a chance while you still got the choice!

You say that you want respect,
Honey, for what?
For everything that you've done for me,
Thanks a lot!
Get up off your bended knees,
You could set your mind at ease!
My temperature's runnin' hot,
And I've been waitin' all night for a bite o' what you got!

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation!
Ma's own whippin' boy!
Rock 'n' roll damnation!
Take a chance while you still got the choice!

(Damnation!) They're puttin' you down,
(Damnation!) All over town!
(Damnation!) 'Cause you're way outta reach,
Livin' on the streets, you gotta practice what you preach!

And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation!
Ma's own whippin' boy!
Rock 'n' roll damnation!
Take a chance while you still got the choice!

Solo

(Damnation!) Left a happy home,
(Damnation!) Just to live on your own!
(Damnation!) You wanna live in sin,
(Damnation!) It's a rock 'n' roll -
Damnation! Just a bundle of joy,
(Damnation!) You're a toy for a boy!
(Damnation!) You got dollars in your eye,
(Damnation!) Chasin' that pie in the sky!
(Damnation!) Rock 'n' roll -
Damnation!
