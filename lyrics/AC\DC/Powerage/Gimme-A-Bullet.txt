She had the word
Had the way
The way of letting me know[the way of letting you know]
She knew the game
Called the play
Oh she hit me low
She said, "Now you go your way
I'll go mine
And that's a start"
Doctor, doctor
Ain't no cure
For the pain in my heart
Chorus:
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on
And I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you
Don't need no drink
Don't need no drug
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later
Send me a bill
For what she's doing to me
Operator
Long distance lips
On the telephone
Come tomorrow
Come to grips
With me all alone[with being all alone]
Chorus
Bullet to bite on
