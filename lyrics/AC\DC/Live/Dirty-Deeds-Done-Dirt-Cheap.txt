If you're havin' trouble with your high school head
He's givin' you the blues
You wanna graduate but not in 'is bed
Here's what you gotta do -
Pick up the phone
I'm always home
Call me any time
Just ring
36 24 36 hey
I lead a life of crime
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap
You got problems in your life of love
You got a broken heart
(She's) He's double dealin' with your best friend
That's when the teardrops start - fella
Pick up the phone
I'm here alone
Or make a social call
Come right in
Forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap
If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts -
Pick up the phone
Leave her alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee
I'm happy to be
Your back door man
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
Dirty Deeds and they're Done Dirt Cheap
Concrete shoes, cyanide, tnt
Done Dirt Cheap
Neckties, contracts, high voltage
Done Dirt Cheap
