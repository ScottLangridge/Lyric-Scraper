She was a danger,
Aint no stranger,
You give me rock 'n' roll, around the town,
Just foolin' around,
She's gonna break ya,
Wanna make ya,
Gonna make it,
Wanna take it down,
She's gonna rock 'n' roll 'n' slide it down,

Wheels,
Spinnin' around my brain, driving you insane,
Wheels,
Rolling 'round my head, going through the red,

She wanna shake you, no way to save you,
She's got me shot, I'm fallin'
I'm blowin' it out,
Know what I'm talkin' about,
She's gonna ride you, wanna slide you,
Ain't no fakin' she wanna take you out,
You betcha right, she's gonna spin you 'round,

Wheels,
Spinnin' around my head, driving you insane,
Wheels,
Rolling 'round my head, going through the red,
Wheels,
Flyin' down the road, ready to explode,
Wheels,
Burnin' down the road, hitting overload,

(Guitar Solo)

Wheels,
Spinnin' around my brain, driving you insane,
Wheels,
Rolling 'round my head, going through the red,
Wheels,
Flyin' down the road, ready to explode,
Wheels,
Burnin' up the road, hitting overload,
Wheels,
Hitting overload
Wheels,
Ready to explode
