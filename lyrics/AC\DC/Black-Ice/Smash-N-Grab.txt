Come on and blow your mind
Oooh you're out of time
Oooh beat your chest
Join in like all the rest

Oooh shove'm back
Hey hey hey yes
Hey hey hey yeah

Seems like you run a mile
Hey try to unwind
Come on let's blow your mind
It's no use you ain't got time
Without a sound
Come on let's get around
Oh I hear the crash

Come on in and just smash, grab and take it
(Smash grab and take it)
(Awww awww awww)
While you can
Smash, grab and take it
(Smash grab and take it)
(Awww awwww awww)
Hey hey hey yeah

Why don't you come out
Come on run it to the ground
You're gonna blow your mind
You're gonna pulverize
Once you've come up late
You gotta pick up straight
It's gonna blow your mind
And all the living's gone

Smash, grab and take it
(Smash grab and take it)
(Awww awww awww)
Take it for yourself
Smash, grab and take it
(Smash grab and take it)
(Awww awww awww)
Take it take it take it yeah

Come on let's blow your mind
Hey hey hey yeah

Oooh take it while you can
Come on let's blow your mind
Smash, grab, take it
(Awww awww awww)

Smash, grab and take it for yourself
