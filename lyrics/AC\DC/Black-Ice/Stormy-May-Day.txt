The storm is ragin',
The winds are howlin;
The water's calling -
Rescue You.

A flash of lightning,
And all look frightenin;
Horror is comin'
And the sun don't shine.

Chorus

Baby. Baby
Make it, Stormy May Day x2
Stormy May Day

Ahhw!

The sky is darkening,
The dogs are barkin',
I go for help
You hope will get you through

I come for fightin',
I stand besire her,
The people runnin',
And the moon don't rise

Chorus

Way Day, May Day
Way Day, Story May Day x2
