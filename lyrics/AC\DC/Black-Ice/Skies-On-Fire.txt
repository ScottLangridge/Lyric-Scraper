Why don't you hang up,
Won't you back up
Will you pack up and head for higher ground,
I know you and, you know me,
Tell me what it is you want it to be
What you want to be,
What you need in me,
Hey hey hey

Skies on fire,
Flames burn higher,
Skies on fire,
Flames get higher

I know you, now you know me,
Tell me what it is you want it to be,
In the rain, in the streets,
You're amazed by all the things that you see,
Tell me what I see, how's it got to be,
Yeah yeah yeah

Skies on fire,
Flames burn higher,
Skies on fire,
Flames burn higher,

Hey you look in the sky, skies on fire
Look in the sky, flames burn higher,
Skies on fire,
Flames get higher,
Skies on fire,
I know you and you know me,
Tell me what is it you want to be,
Flames burn higher,
Skies on fire
