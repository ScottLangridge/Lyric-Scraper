Flying on a free flight
Driving all night
With my machinery
'Cause I, I got the power
Any hour
To show the man in me
I got reputations
Blown to pieces
With my artillery
Whoa ho
I'll be guided in
We'll be ridin'
Given what you got to me
Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight
chorus:
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife
Oh, Like a fever
Burning faster
You spark the fire in me
Crazy feelings
Got me reeling
They got me raising steam
Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight
Yeah
chorus
Cut it
Let me, let me
Oooh
chorus
Oh
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me give it all
Let me give it all
To you, to you
Give it all
