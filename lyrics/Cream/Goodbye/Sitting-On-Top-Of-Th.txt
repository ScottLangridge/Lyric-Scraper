One summer day, she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay.
She's gone, but I don't worry,
I'm sittin' on top of the world.
All the summer, worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls.
She's gone, but I don't worry,
I'm sittin' on top of the world.
Going down to the freight yard,
Gonna catch me a freight train.
Gonna leave this town,
Work done got to hard.
She's gone, but I don't worry,
I'm sittin' on top of the world.

[Goodbye Cream:]
One summer day, she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay.
She's gone, but I don't worry,
Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world.
All last summer, worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls.
She's gone, gone, but I don't worry, no
Cause I'm sittin', sittin' on top of the world.
Going down to the freight yard, yeh, yeh, yeh
Gonna catch me a freight train.
Gonna leave this town, yeh, yeh, yeh
Work done got to hard.
She's gone, but I don't worry,
Cause I'm sittin', I'm sittin'on top of the world.
