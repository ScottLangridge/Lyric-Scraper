There was a man
Who walked alone
Searching for the girl who had just caught his
"I was a fool!" he cried
His mind had wandered
He blinked and the sky moved ever so slightly
He searched the city
She was nowhere to be found
Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward

Do you want your freedom
Do you want my love
Do you want your freedom
From the one you're thinking of

There lies a lady
Naked and yet not knowing it
A spell had chained her heart forever
Pray upon by the wolves in Times Square
Feel into an abyss of thin air
Innocence caged in sanctuary
There sat the Dragon Lord
Playing solitairy
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen

Do you want your freedom
Do you want my love
Do you want your freedom
From the man who lives above

Suddenly a voice was heard
In a flash the  brave young man appeared
The Dragon Lord will cut him with his tail
Chased him to the stairway
Caught him halfway to the top
Sent him whirling down
Fireballs, summer solstice
The Dragon Lord descended down on him
She turned to look but saw only darkness silence

You don't want your freedom
You don't want my love
You don't want your throat cut
By the same I'm thinking of
