It's a feeling, I don't belong here
But man's on the outside looking in, wonderin' losin' his old margin
It's a feeling, you never belonged to me
First you're on the up 'n up, only to down in sea
Only to down in sea

You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from me

(repeats 2x)

It's a feeling...
