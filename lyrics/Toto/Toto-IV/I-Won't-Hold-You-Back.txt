If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
Now you're gone, I'm really not the same, I guess I held myself to blame
Time can erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's sad

Chorus:
You know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now

Now that I'm alone it gives me time to think about the years that you were mine
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

Chorus

[Instrumental]

You know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found

You know I can't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found
