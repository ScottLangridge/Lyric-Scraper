Feel the heat - in the street
Find out what your people are sayin'

Feel the heat - in the street
Find out what the people are sayin'
'Bout you! Yeh you

Friends you keep - lie and cheat
Makin' rules for games that they're playin'

When you meet - on the street
You find out all along they're playin'
Me against you

Bridge:
I don't care what they say about me
I've heard that all before
Just make this one exception
Give me your affection
Listen to your heart for what you need

Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life
Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life

Feel the heat - in the street
You're the one that keeps the boys dreamin'

If you feel the need - come to me
Or you may find what's on your mind
May come true

Bridge:
I can tell by the look in your eyes
There's a fear deep inside
In spite of my arrival
The key to your survival
Is hidden in your dreams and desires

Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life
Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life

(Instrumental brake)

Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life
Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life

Promise me tonight
All the love I need for the rest of my life
