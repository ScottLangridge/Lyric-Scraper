Day after day
I feel myself slowing down
What does it mean?
The air has changed
It's getting harder to breath
Or so it would seem
Sail me away to a distant shore
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin'
The world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years

Tell me my friend
Can you imagine a place
Free of boundaries and lies
There's blood on the wind
And it's come all of the way from faraway skies
Take me away to a different world
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin'
The world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years

A thousand years
One day for every life
Just keep on going
We'll find you a home underground
In a thousand years

[Instrumental break]

Sail me away to a distant shore
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin'
The world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years

A thousand years
One day for every life
Just keep on going
We'll find you a home underground
In a thousand years

(Sail me away to a distant shore
Where everything's fine)
