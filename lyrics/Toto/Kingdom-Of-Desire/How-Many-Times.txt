How many years
Keep on slipping away
And it seems that your life doesn't matter
You never had a chance

How many ways is a love torn apart
And you look to your heart
For some answers
Don't let it slip away

Can't blame myself anymore
I've been beaten and accused before
Well I took some bad advice
And I paid too high a price
I could sell my soul
You know I wouldn't think twice

How many times must a man fall down
I said whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
How many dreams have to fall to the ground
It goes on an' on an' on an' on an' on yeah

How many times do you look for some sign
That there's hope
And your life has some meaning
Almost every day

Maybe I was born to wander
I got no high hopes any longer
So tell me my friend
Just where does it end
Is nothin' ever gonna free me
From this hell I'm livin' in

How many times must a man fall down
I said whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
How many dreams have to fall to the ground
It goes on an' on an' on an' on an' on yeah

[Instrumental]

Can't blame myself anymore
I've been beaten and accused before
So tell me my friend
Just where does it end
I'm sick and tired
Of livin' in a rat race that no one ever wins

How many times must a man fall down
I said whoa-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
How many dreams have to fall to the ground
It goes on an' on an' on an' on an' on yeah
(repeats 2x)
