My faithful companion
I've lost my way once again
A prisoner of darkness
I let you down my friend

A heart left abandoned takes so long to heal it's wounds
Your touch not forgotten
The end of the dream
It comes too soon
In this lonely room
Till I leave this world
Always know that

I will surrender my heart to the sky
Oh our love doesn't end here
It lives forever on the wings of time

The road that I travel
Don't know which way I should turn
Till I find the answer
Know that the fire within me will always burn

Angel of mercy, please
Why so much pain?
I cry for forgiveness
I'm the destitute man
Who still remains
It's so hard to explain
Till I leave this world
Always know that

I will surrender my heart to the sky
Oh our love doesn't end here
It lives forever on the wings of time

Sometimes I feel just like crying
I can't turn my back
All these years I've been trying
A vision of you keeps reappearing to me
You can't blame yourself
Just reach out your hand and believe

(Instrumental break)

We sail in dark waters
Lord give me some peace of mind
Temptation before me
Ahead lies the tower of truth that I must find
To you I will climb
Till I leave this cruel world far behind
Always know that

I will surrender my heart to the sky
Oh our love doesn't end here
It lives forever on the wings of time
(repeats 2x)
