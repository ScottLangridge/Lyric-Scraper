Waiting for you again
Seems like this never ends
I close my eyes and I see your face
And I see it all fading away

Woke up before you again
You're still asleep I can't pretend
I feel like I'm losing you
And I am trying to make everything right

Only you
Only me
Say the words I want to hear for all eternity
Only you
Holding my heart in your hands
Only me
Still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh

If I could have a second chance
Maybe change the circumstance
Imagine if the dream came true
We could start it all over tonight

Only you
Only me
Say the words I want to hear for all eternity
Only you
Holding my heart in your hands
Only me
Still trying to understand, whoa no oh oh
(repeats 2x)

Only me
Say the words I want to hear for all eternity
Only you
Holding my heart in your hands
Only me
Still trying to understand
Whoa no oh oh
