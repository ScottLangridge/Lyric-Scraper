Chorus:
You supply the night, baby, I'll supply the love
You supply the night, baby, I'll supply the love
I see a horseman in the sky, it makes me turn and wonder why
I hear the same old fourteen reasons, must be the changin' of the seasons

Chorus

I met the girl across the sea, she saved my life and came with me
A tender night of dark persuasion, could be my first and last occasion

Chorus

[Instrumental]

Baby, I'll supply the love, baby, I'll supply the, I'll supply the love
