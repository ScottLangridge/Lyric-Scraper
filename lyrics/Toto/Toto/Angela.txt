Can't eat, can't sleep
Can't seem to find time anymore
Somewhere she weeps
Her hair gently brushes the floor
I know my way
I know that I'll find her somehow

Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon

Cold moon, dark sky
I'm watching my mind disappear
She sits alone
Not knowing that I am so near
Why can't she hear my voice as I call out her name

Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon

It's a silly situation
It's just infatuation
No need to be sorry

Can't eat, can't sleep
Can't seem to find time anymore
Somewhere she weeps
Her hair gently brushes the floor
I know my way
I know that I'll find her somehow

Angela carries me back to the time
When I knew that her love was still mine
Angela's holding the child in her womb
And I pray that she will be calling soon

It's a silly situation
It's just infatuation
No need to be sorry
