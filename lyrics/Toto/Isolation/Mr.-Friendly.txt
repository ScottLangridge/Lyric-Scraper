Get out, I won't even listen
I can't hear a single word you say
Enough of your intimidation
Don't tell me 'bout the price I pay

Take off, don't want your kind of trouble
Don't wanna see you hangin' 'round my place
It's late and here's the situation
I never wanna see your face

You just drag me down
And I've got the scars to show
I think you oughta know

You got the best of me
Mr. Friendly
You got the best of me

Don't ask, can't promise any favors
Don't want to owe you anything again
Bad luck, it's your occupation
Can't you see you are your own worst friend

I'm gone, the masquerade is over
I'm cashin' in the silver tray
So long, I can't buy this evil game you play

You just drag me down
And I've got the scars to show
I think you oughta know

You got the best of me
You got the best of me
Mr. Friendly
There's nothing left of me
You got the best of me

He's standing in your way
You smile like it's okay
Knowing you'll show him somehow

You're running out of the time
Too late to change your mind
No one can save you now

Mr. Friendly
You got the best of me
Mr. Friendly
You got the best of me

Mr. Friendly
There's nothing left of me
Mr. Friendly
You got the best of me
