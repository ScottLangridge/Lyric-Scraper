At the end of my life
When it's time to depart
Will the last face I see be yours
When I take my last breath
And I drift through the dark
Will I look 'round and still feel secure

It's no sacrifice to stay by your side
Till hell freezes clear to the core
Whatever the price
No matter how high
Over your shoulder
When you turn around
I'll be tellin' you

(Chorus:)
No love will ever be stronger
No love not anywhere, no no
No love will ever last longer
If I can't have your love, I don't want no love at all

I'll put my change on the dresser
Next to your scarf
Cook my heart in the skillet next to yours
Ten thousand tears lead up to now
You are the treasure for sure

Lines on my face they get deeper each day
But the feelings are ageless and smooth
One single trace of doubt still remains
Over my shoulder, when I turn around,
Will you be tellin' me

[Chorus:]

[Instrumental]

It's no sacrifice to stay by your side
Till hell freezes clear to the core
Whatever the price
No matter how high
Over your shoulder
When you turn around
I'll be telling you

(Repeat chorus two times)
