There's something I must say
Something I must do
I planned it all this way
Designed it just for you
Do you wanna be with me
Be with me at all?
Do you have to be so cool
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew

(Chorus:)
I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

Can we go on this way?
There's nothing left to proof
It's not another game
Or another simple move
Do you believe in me
Believe in me at all?
Are you telling me the truth?
Or is it just imagination or the perfect dream
That I'm here with you

(Chorus)

(Instrumental break)

Do you wanna be with me
Be with me at all?
Do you have to be so cool
Your gentle touch manoeuvered me
But all the time I always knew

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I'm giving you the only heart I have
But I'm afraid tonight it won't be enough

I'm really mad about you
There's nothing bad about our love
I never had a broken heart before
But I know you'll never tear
Tear mine apart
