What happened to me
It seems so long ago
The cuts run deep
But the scars still show
I live in the shadows
Where it's been so hard to grow
I'm still a servant in a nobleman's robes

You know my weakness girl
You know my kind
You helped me see when I was blind

(Chorus:)
It's a crime to live my life without you
Serve out my years in darkness
Inside these walls I'd die without you
And when I close my eyes I'm caught in the balance

Afraid of the hurricane I hide in my domain
I need release from all this pain
Please don't forsake me
In these ruins I call home
I can't wait forever
Don't leave me alone

I have a secret if you wanna learn
I will surrender in return

(Chorus)

(Instrumental break)

You know my weakness girl
You know my kind
You helped me see when I was blind

(Repeat chorus two times)
