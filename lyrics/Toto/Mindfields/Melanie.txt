Watching
Driving through the night
I'm all alone
Empty
Endless road
A thousand miles to go
Midnight
Five million thoughts
Passing in a row
Will you
Still be waiting there?
God only knows

I can still see your face in my mind
With every turn I take
And the wind through my heart feels so cold
As it calls out your name

(Chorus:)
Melanie
Nothing but the touch of your hand can rescue me
Melanie
Reach inside this emptiness and you will set me free

Morning
Sun's in my eyes
I'm tied to your soul
One chance
One solitary life
How could I let you go?

Got a phonecall or was it a dream
A voice spoke to me
I could swear it was you that I heard
Crying desperately

[Chorus:]

[Instrumental]

I can still see your face in my mind
With every turn I take
And the wind through my heart feels so cold
As it calls out your name

(Repeat chorus two times
