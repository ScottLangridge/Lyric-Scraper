You're just a mile away
One thousand five tiny steps from here
But if I brought you near
Would you believe when I say
It seems like yesterday
That I could reach out and touch your face
But as I fall from grace
Into whose arms can I lay

It's always much too late
We get the signs
We can't communicate
Or turn back time

(Chorus:)
So what will be now
Do you feel somehow
Not so together and not quite as strong
Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

I need a healing wind
To cool the flame burning in my sight
It must accelerate
For two wrongs they don't make a right

And all these solitaires, lone victories
Wars fought in isolation, with none to please

[Chorus:]

[Instrumental]

The future's still uncertain
The past is done

[Chorus:]

Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone

Now I believe
Alone doesn't have to mean lonely
After you've gone
