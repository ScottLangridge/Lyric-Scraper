Sometimes it hurts clear to the core
When we lose all we've cared for
The hunger and thirst
For love that endures
Is never ending

What will I do with my life?
Try to share it with somebody new?
And how can I learn to disguise
That I'm lost without you

All I have left is a heart full of mirrors
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
Girl it's over
I'll hear it echo deep inside
'Til the other end of time
The other end of time

Left over dreams fade in my mind
And I'm counting on this love to die
'Cause all that I need
Is to give my whole life
A new beginning

But something is holding me down
Like I'm under a mountain of stone
And all I can hear is the sound
Of my own heart breaking

'Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
Girl it's over
I'll hear it echo deep inside
'Til the other end of time
Until the end of time

(Instrumental brake)

'Cause all I have left is a heart of mirrors
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
Girl it's over
I'll hear it echo deep inside

All I have left is a heart full of mirrors
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
Girl it's over
I'll hear it echo deep inside
'Til the other end of time
'Til the other end of time
Until the end of time
Oh baby
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
