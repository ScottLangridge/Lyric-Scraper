I've got a flaming road of karma and a mobile phone
I was raised by the radio in a broken home, 
I've got a broken smile and an arrogant line
I'm really no-one special but I'm in my prime.

I've got a hardbody girlfriend
I've got a wallet full of cash, 
You can bury my body
I'm just North London Trash
I've got a flaming road of karma and I'll do it alone
I grew up with the TV in a broken home, 
I've got match of the day, black converse
I'm really no-one special, but Ive seen you do much worse.

Ive got a hardbody girlfriend
She helps me spend my cash, 
Then we roll on my floorboards
Like nouveau North London Trash

If you don't't unblock this rifle it'll pitch
I could marry her for the money but she's known to be a drag
On my Collateral and my arrogant streak, 
I'm really no-one special but I'm here in my prime and my peak

My hardboby girlfriend
She makes the cameras flash
You can pin up our bodies
But you can't kill
North London Trash

And you ain't bad looking son, she just ain't looking for you
You've shown a lot of fight, but this ain't your night, or even your year
You ain't bad looking now, 
Watch where you're looking now
Is anybody looking now?
