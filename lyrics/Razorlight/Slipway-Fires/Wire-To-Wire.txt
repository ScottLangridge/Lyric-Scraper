What is love but a strangest of feelings?
A sin you swallow for the rest of your life
You've been looking for someone to believe in
To love you, until your eyes run dry

She lives on disillusion's glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar
Love me, wherever you are

How do you love with a fate full of rust?
How do you turn what was savage tame?
You've been looking for someone you can trust
To love you again and again

How do you love in a house without feelings?
How do you turn what was savage tame?
I've been looking for someone to believe in
To love me, again and again

She lives by disillusion's glow
We go where the wild blood flows
On our bodies we share the same scar

How do you love on a night without feelings?
She says "love, I hear sound, I see fury"
She says "love is not a hostile condition"
Love me, wherever you are

Love me, wherever you are
Love me, wherever you are
Wherever you are
