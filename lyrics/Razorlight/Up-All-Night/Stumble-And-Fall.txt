I heard that it was a really big deal
But then I found out it was just nothing at all
You always say it's such a big deal
But we both know that that's nothing at all
And I get over the breaks
And I, I stumble and fall
And I get over the breaks
And sometimes stumble and fall

You just wont admit that it's all in your hands
So I have to try so hard to make you understand
But all you can say is "It's just part of the deal"
And I never asked you to understand
How I keep myself to myself in the crush of the crowd
But all you can say is
"Who cares? It's part of the deal"

And I get over the breaks
And I, I stumble and fall
And I get over the breaks
And sometimes stumble and fall

Well I, I get over the breaks
And I stumble and fall
And I get over the breaks
And sometimes stumble and fall
Yes I fall
Yes I fall
I stumble and fall
