Well it's a close one, a real close one
And no-one gets hurt, but she's got twice the fun
But now they kiss in the rain
And did someone call out someone's name
From a white cadillac on a wide wind
To her white dress across the great divide
Into the warm moonlight
And she's been reading Bukowski for days
And she leans over, spits her name in my face
And says "Well now you know how it feels"
Well now you know how it feels

And I was looking for you
Looking for you
Looking for you in the city last night

The boys in the band steal a kiss in the mystery of the night
11: 59 to zero, live a blonde hair in jeans, holds her tight
Turns on the heat and starts to fight and sayin' "that's my man"
Well the myth of love must have been there
The spirit of possession was there

And the boys over at the bar
Yeah they're mixing up their medicine
The girls were on their mobile trying to get reception
Johnny's shadow's getting long but he keeps on singing
His shadow getting long but he keeps on singing:

And I was looking for you
Looking for you
Looking for you in the city last night

And people so strange
People so strange
People just keep talking in the city last night

Take off your shades and scroll down to number nine
You're living on the guest list, up against the big rack
Head back, hand highs, it's getting loud in here
Think you're going to have to shout
And she's tearing off her clothes
He's stirring all his drinks, oh yeah
Streets divide them
It's an empire of signs
Honey say she can read
And it looks like trouble
And it tastes like chocolate if you want it
It looks like trouble
And it tastes like chocolate if you want it

Still I was looking for you
Looking for you
Looking for you in the city last night

And people so strange
People so strange
People just keep talking in the city last night

And I was looking for you
And I was looking for you
And I was looking for you in the city last night

And I was looking for you
Yeah I was looking for you
Yeah I was looking for you in the city last night

It's alright!
It's alright!
If you say my name
It's alright!
