Oh when did you decide
To start living like it's suicide
And wasting all my time
And messing up my mind
Oh now darling please leave me alone
I'm so tired I wanna be on my own
But you come on calling on my telephone
And I wish I could show you somewhere better
Better to go

And when you get there
Well if you freak them all out
With your sweatshop charm
You'll leave them in no doubt

And when you get challenged
You'll only lie about your age
But it's the distance you travel
And the fields you unravel
And all the bars on your cage

Oh now darling please leave me alone
I'm so tired I wanna be on my own
But you come on calling on my telephone
And I wish I could show you somewhere better
Better, better, better to go

To somewhere else
Somewhere else, somewhere else

Oh you've got to...
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Oh just leave me alone
What don't you understand
Just leave me alone
What don't you understand!
What is there to understand?
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
