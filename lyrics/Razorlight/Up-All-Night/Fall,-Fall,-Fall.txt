Midnight's calling
Are you close behind?
Midnight's calling
Are you close behind?

Trees without leaves and notes that don't ring
Wine left to rot and a voice that can't sing
And hours of making love in silence
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness

Could I be any clearer?
Could I speak any plainer?- I need you here
Just to lean my way
And fall, fall, fall

She scolded me for my sinful and wicked ways
Towered above me - do you follow?
And watched with concealed pleasure
As I ripped out my heart and said
I'm just bad, I can't help it
But I tr-tr-tr-try to be good

And trees without leaves and notes that don't ring
Wine left to rot and a voice that can't sing
And hours of making love in silence
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness

Could I be any clearer?
Well could I speak any plainer?- I need you here
Just to lean my way
And fall, fall, fall

'Cause people make you lonely
People make you lonely sometime.
