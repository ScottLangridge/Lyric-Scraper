Away and away, over bridges and sighs
And on and on, on and on
She keeps it all locked up right inside
While up above, where the looking glass skies
Go on and on, on and on
She can't say a word, she keeps it inside

To the sea
To the sea
Oh down into the sea
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me?

So go away, for a year and a day
Come back to me, oh you will see
Throw it away, there's money to be made
Oh darling you will make it in the sea

Yeah to the sea
Yeah to the sea
Oh down into the sea
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me?

Just pick me up, put me down
We'll get out of this old town,
And leave it all, to the sea

So go away and then shut your mouth
Cause darling, you'll see how it all turns out
Ha!
Throw it away, for a year and a day
And then... Come back to me!

Down to the sea
Down to the sea
Oh down into the sea
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me
Yeah, what about me?

Just pick me up, put me down
We'll get out of this old town,
And leave it all, to the sea

To the sea...
No more, no more
