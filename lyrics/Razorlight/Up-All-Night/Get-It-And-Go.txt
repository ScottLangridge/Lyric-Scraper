We talked all night about suicide
And she said if this is living
How come I never feel alive?

First time you're there
Well it gets you up
Second time alright
But it's just not enough
No, it shootss through your veins
Tears all you nerves appart

Well, you give it a go
You give it a go
You know it's alright
You know it's alright
You give it a go
You give it a go
You get a little high
And you get a little low

I've seen you there so many times
You had your hands in your pocket
You said "I've just got this message on my phone, and it's blowing my mind,
You know it's tearing me up inside out"
Strangles me, Strangles me

You know
First time you're there
Well it gets you up
Second times alright
But it's the second circle of hell in your mind
It shoots through your veins
It tears all you nerves appart

Oh, just give it a go
Just give it a go
You know it's alright
You know it's alright
Just give it a go
Just give it a go
You get a little high
You get a little low
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You know it's alright
You know it's alright
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You get a little high
You get a little low

Well if it's all so hard
Why don't you slide on down with me
And if your hanging on my words
Well that's alright with me
Because it's just so easy
And we'll be alright

Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You know it's alright
You know it's alright
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You get a little high
You get a little low
Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go

Your giving it a go
Your giving it a go
You get so high
Your so high

Count your fingers to four
One, Two, Three, Four,
And that's it
