This party isn't working, oh no
Yeah we need to find days like we used to
Living off a shoe string
Never, never knew what the night would bring

Now you look like you've been up for days
People walk in
Then they fall out
There's really not much to shout about

Still you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you look about

Yeah you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you figure out
And it all comes out

And you say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way's out?
You say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way's out?

An' I put your picture right up on my wall
I said show me how to walk
Show me how to talk
Show me how to be a man
That's all I need

An' I really put all my faith in you
Then you left right there
At the top of the stairs
With your mind half gone
And you never even cared

Still you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you look about

Yeah you rack 'em up, knock 'em back
Line 'em up, put 'em down
Have a little taste, then you figure out
And it all comes out

And you say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way's out?
You say I just can't get there, no more
So tell me which way's out?
Tell me which way's out?
Tell me which way's out?
Tell me which way...
I never know
I never know...
