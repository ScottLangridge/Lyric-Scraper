I can't quit you babe.
So I think I'm gonna put you down for a while.
I can't quit you babe.
I think I'm gonna put you down for a while.
I said you messed up my happy home.
Made me mistreat my only child.

You know I love you babe.
My love for you I could never hide.
You know I love you babe.
My love for you I could never hide.
When I feel you near me little girl,
I know you are my one desire.

When you hear me moaning and groaning babe,
You know it hurts me deep down inside.
When you hear me moaning and groaning babe,
You know it hurts me deep down inside.
When you hear me, You know you're my one desire.
