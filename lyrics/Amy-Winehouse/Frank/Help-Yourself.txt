When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your shoulders bear
Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Besides nobody can be that wise

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help ya if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You've got a degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
But I'm not just some drama queen

Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea
And there are you even though you're bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway we're still so young
And this isn't yesterday

I can't help you if you won't help yourself
I can't help ya if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years or most the time
And I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I like nothing  I've ever known yeah
I'm nothing like I've ever  knew
