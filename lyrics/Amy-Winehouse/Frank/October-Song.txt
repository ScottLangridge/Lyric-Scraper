Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
I sang a lullaby of bird land every night
Sang for my Ava every night

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'till one day she couldn't be heard
Spoken 'till one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

She flies in paradise
[Scattiing]
